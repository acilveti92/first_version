He took the elevator to the lobby and went out to a car waiting for him by the entrance. He was a senior Syrian official who had arrived from Damascus that very afternoon. Now he was on his way to a meeting.</p><p id="p1422" class="text-indent">As soon as he exited through the revolving doors, two men got up from armchairs in a far corner of the lobby. They knew exactly where to go. Reaching the Syrian’s room, they gained access with a special <span class="ref-pnum">electronic</span> device. They were ready to search the room methodically, but this time, their task was easy. A laptop computer was on the desk. The two men turned it on and, within moments, expertly installed a <span class="ref-pnum">sophisticated</span> version of a Trojan horse software. The program allowed them to monitor and copy from afar all the files stored in the computer’s memory. The job done, the two men left the hotel undetected.</p><p id="p1423" class="text-indent">Mossad analysts in Tel Aviv studied the computer files and were stunned. At an urgent meeting of department heads, they described the priceless information that had fallen into their hands: a collection of <a id="pagebreak-rw_280"></a>files, photographs, drawings, and documents that exposed, for the first time, Syria’s top-secret nuclear program. The material was of supreme <span class="ref-pnum">importance</span> and included the construction plans for a nuclear reactor in a remote desert area; correspondence between the Syrian government and high-level officials in the North Korean administration; and photographs showing the reactor encased in concrete. Another photograph showed two men—one of them turned out to be a senior official in the North Korean atomic project and the other was Ibrahim Othman, the head of the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission.</p><p id="p1424" class="text-indent">The findings confirmed several fragmentary reports that had reached the Israel intelligence community in 2006 and 2007. The reports indicated that the Syrian government was building, in utmost secrecy, a nuclear <span class="ref-pnum">reactor</span> at the desert site of Dir Al-Zur, in the far northeast of the country. The isolated site was adjacent to the Turkish border, and some hundred miles from Iraqi territory. Perhaps the most surprising revelation in the reports was the fact that the Syrian facility was being planned and supervised by North Korean nuclear experts and financed by Iran.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line88"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara125"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he close cooperation between Syria and North Korea had started with the 1990 visit to Damascus of North Korea’s president, Kim Il-Sung. During that visit, at the instigation of Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad, the two countries had signed an agreement on military and <span class="ref-pnum">technological</span> cooperation. Even though the nuclear issue was discussed in talks between the two heads of state, Assad decided to give it only secondary priority at that time and concerned himself mostly with the development of chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, he canceled plans to buy nuclear reactors from Russia. In February 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, a first shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea was unloaded in Syria. Reports on the existence of the missiles reached Moshe Arens, <span class="ref-pnum">Israel’s</span> minister of defense. Several army generals recommended a military strike be initiated to destroy the Scuds before they became operational. Arens dismissed the idea, wishing to avoid another conflagration in the region.</p><p id="p1425" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_281"></a>At Hafez Al-Assad’s funeral in June 2000, his son and successor, Bashar Al-Assad, met with another North Korean delegation. The two parties <span class="ref-pnum">secretly</span> discussed the construction of a nuclear facility in Syria, to be <span class="ref-pnum">overseen</span> by the Syrian Scientific Research Agency. In July 2002, another secret meeting was held in Damascus, with the participation of senior officials from Syria, Iran, and North Korea, at which a tripartite agreement was reached. North Korea would construct a nuclear reactor in Syria, to be <span class="ref-pnum">financed</span> by Iran. The cost of the entire project, from the drawing board to the production of weapons-grade plutonium, was estimated at $2 billion.</p><p id="p1426" class="text-indent">For the next five years, despite small scraps of information that <span class="ref-pnum">trickled</span> from Damascus, neither the CIA nor Mossad were aware of the <span class="ref-pnum">Syrian</span> project. Several warning lights had flashed sporadically, but had been ignored. The American intelligence services failed to grasp the meaning of the information that had accumulated, while Mossad and Aman were misled by their own estimates that Syria had neither the capability nor the desire to obtain nuclear weapons. And no one sought to challenge that misconception, although evidence was there: in 2005, the cargo ship <span class="ref-pnum"><em class="calibre7">Andorra</em></span>, a ship carrying cement from North Korea to Syria, sank close to the Israeli coastal town of Nahariya; in 2006, a second North Korean cargo vessel, sailing under a Panamanian flag, was detained in Cyprus with another cargo of cement and a portable radar station; in both cases, the “cement” was evidently equipment for the nuclear reactor. Finally, in late 2006, Iranian nuclear experts visited Damascus to inspect the progress of the construction of the facility. The Israeli and American intelligence <span class="ref-pnum">services</span> knew of this visit but failed to realize that it was linked to the Dir Al-Zur project.</p><p id="p1427" class="text-indent">The Syrians took extreme precautions to protect the secrecy of the <span class="ref-pnum">project</span>. They imposed a total communications blackout on all the staff <span class="ref-pnum">working</span> at the site. Possession of cell phones and satellite devices was strictly forbidden; all communications were taken out by messengers, who carried letters and messages and delivered them by hand. The activity at the site could not be identified from space, even though American and Israeli <span class="ref-pnum">satellites</span> kept passing overhead.</p><p id="p1428" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_282"></a>And then, suddenly, on February 7, 2007, a passenger alighted from a plane at Damascus Airport. He was Ali Reza Asgari, an Iranian general and a former deputy minister of defense, who had been one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Guards (see chapter 2). He stayed at the airport until he received confirmation that his family had left Iran. He then flew on to Turkey. Soon after landing in Istanbul, he vanished.</p><p id="p1429" class="text-indent">A month later, it was learned that Asgari had defected to the West in an operation masterminded by the CIA and Mossad. He was interrogated and debriefed at an American base in Germany, where he revealed the <span class="ref-pnum">existence</span> of the Syrian-Iranian nuclear plans and the agreement between North Korea, Iran, and Syria. He told his interlocutors that Iran was not only financing the Dir Al-Zur project but was exerting strong pressure on Syria to complete it as soon as possible. He supplied the CIA and Mossad with a wealth of detail about the progress of the project, and identified the key officials in both Syria and Iran who were involved in it.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line89"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara126"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his new information shocked Mossad into action and it immediately switched into an operational mode. Since 2002, the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em> was Meir Dagan, who had replaced Efraim Halevy (see chapter 1). According to <span class="ref-pnum">foreign</span> sources, Dagan assigned units and agents to verify the Asgari report. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert convened a meeting of the army chiefs of staff, the Ministry of Defense, and the intelligence services. They <span class="ref-pnum">unanimously</span> agreed that an urgent operation was called for, so as to obtain solid and irrefutable information about the Dir Al-Zur facility. Israel could not accept the transformation of Syria, its most implacable and aggressive foe, into a power with the potential to manufacture nuclear weapons.</p><p id="p1430" class="text-indent">It was just five months after Asgari’s defection that Mossad agents achieved their major breakthrough—the laptop of the Syrian official. The heads of Mossad and Aman could now present Prime Minister Olmert with the definitive evidence the government needed.</p><p id="p1431" class="text-indent">Soon after, Dagan allegedly pulled off another coup. In a bold and creative operation, a Mossad case officer managed to recruit one of the <a id="pagebreak-rw_283"></a>scientists employed at the reactor itself. He photographed the reactor <span class="ref-pnum">extensively</span>, both inside and out, and even made a video of the structures and equipment inside them. These were the first images Mossad had received of the reactor, taken at ground level. They revealed a large cylindrical <span class="ref-pnum">structure</span> with thin but solid fortified walls. Other pictures showed an external scaffold designed to strengthen the reactor’s outer walls. There were also photos of a second, smaller building equipped with oil pumps, and several trucks could be seen parked around it. A third structure was apparently a tower that supplied water for the reactor.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line90"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara127"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ossad kept the Americans fully briefed at every step and furnished them with copies of all reports and photos, including satellite <span class="ref-pnum">pictures</span> and transcripts of phone calls between Syria and North Korea. Under relentless pressure from Israel, the United States put its own <span class="ref-pnum">satellites</span> on the case. Both the satellite pictures and electronic tracking of the exchange of phone calls indicated that the Syrians were constructing at breakneck speed.</p><p id="p1432" class="text-indent">In June 2007, Prime Minister Olmert flew to Washington with all the material Israel had collected. He met with President Bush and told him Israel had decided that the Syrian reactor had to be destroyed. Olmert <span class="ref-pnum">suggested</span> that the United States carry out an air strike against the reactor, but the American president refused. According to American sources, the White House responded that “the U.S. chooses not to attack [the reactor].” Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates tried to persuade Israel “to confront [the Syrians] but not attack.” Bush and National Security Adviser Steve Hadley expressed their support for military action in principle, but asked that any operation be delayed until more clearly threatening intelligence could be obtained.</p><p id="p1433" class="text-indent">In July 2007, Israel carried out high-altitude air sorties and programmed its Ofek-7 spy satellite to take detailed photographs of the reactor. These photos, when analyzed by American and Israeli experts, established clearly that Syria was building a reactor identical to North Korea’s nuclear facility at Yongbyon. A video that Israel shared with the United States showed that <a id="pagebreak-rw_284"></a>the cores of both reactors were identical, including the way in which the uranium rods were placed inside the structure. Other videos even showed the faces of North Korean engineers working inside the reactor. <span class="ref-pnum">Additionally</span>, the Aman intercept department, Unit 8200, produced full transcripts of hectic exchanges between Damascus and Pyongyang.</p><p id="p1434" class="text-indent">All this evidence was relayed to Washington, but the United States still demanded irrefutable proof that the facility was indeed a nuclear reactor and that radioactive materials were actually in place. Israel felt it had no choice but to obtain this information as well.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line91"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara128"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n August 2007, Israel came up with the ultimate proof that the facility at Dir Al-Zur was a nuclear reactor. It was obtained by an elite commando unit, Sayeret Matkal, in an operation that risked the lives of scores of Israeli soldiers. Sayeret Matkal commandos flew to Syria by night in two helicopters. They were wearing Syrian Army uniforms. Bypassing <span class="ref-pnum">populated</span> areas, military bases, and radar stations, they landed undetected close to Dir Al-Zur, then approached the reactor site and collected soil samples from the earth surrounding the reactor. Upon analysis back in Israel, these samples were found to be highly radioactive, proving <span class="ref-pnum">irrefutably</span> that radioactive substances were indeed on site.</p><p id="p1435" class="text-indent">This new evidence was presented to Steve Hadley. Once his experts had checked the soil samples, he realized that the matter was deadly <span class="ref-pnum">serious</span>. He summoned his closest aides, and their conclusions were brought before President Bush at Hadley’s daily briefing at the Oval Office. <span class="ref-pnum">Hadley</span> then held talks with Dagan, and concluded that the reactor indeed posed a clear and present danger. The United States now accepted that the Syrian reactor had to be eliminated, and code-named the Dir Al-Zur operation “The Orchard.” In his memoirs, George W. Bush wrote that he considered for a while attacking the reactor, but after discussing the <span class="ref-pnum">options</span> with his national security team, he finally decided against it. He felt that “bombing a sovereign country with no warning or announced justification would create severe blowback.” He also ruled out a covert raid by U.S. soldiers.</p><p id="p1436" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_285"></a>Nevertheless, Olmert phoned President Bush and asked him to destroy the reactor. During the phone conversation, Bush was in the Oval Office, surrounded by his closest aides: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, Steve Hadley and his deputy Elliott Abrams, and others. In the preliminary consultations, Rice had convinced them to reject Israel’s demand.</p><p id="p1437" class="text-indent">“George, I’m asking you to bomb the compound,” Olmert said.</p><p id="p1438" class="text-indent">“I cannot justify an attack on a sovereign nation,” Bush replied, “unless my intelligence agencies stand up and say it’s a weapons program.” Bush recommended “using diplomacy.”</p><p id="p1439" class="text-indent">“Your strategy is very disturbing to me,” Olmert bluntly said. “I’ll do what I believe necessary to protect Israel.”</p><p id="p1440" class="text-indent">“This guy has balls,” Bush later said. “That’s why I like him.”</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line92"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara129"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ccording to London’s <em class="calibre7">Sunday Times</em>, Prime Minister Olmert met with Minister of Defense Ehud Barak and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tzippi Livni. The three of them, together with the heads of the defense and <span class="ref-pnum">intelligence</span> communities, discussed the new evidence, as well as the possible repercussions of a military strike. Finally the die was cast: the Syrian <span class="ref-pnum">reactor</span> would be eliminated. The prime minister briefed opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu and received his wholehearted support.</p><p id="p1441" class="text-indent">The date for the attack was set for the night of September 5, 2007.</p><p id="p1442" class="text-indent">The previous day, according to a later report in the<em class="calibre7"> Sunday Times,</em> <span class="ref-pnum">another</span> elite commando unit, Shaldag (Kingfisher) had reached the Dir Al-Zur area. The men spent almost a day in hiding close to the reactor. Their mission was to illuminate the reactor with laser beams the following night so the air force jets could home in directly on the target. At eleven <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>. on September 5, ten F-15 aircraft took off from the Ramat David Air Force Base and headed west, over the Mediterranean. Thirty minutes later, three of the planes were ordered to return to base. The other seven were instructed to head for the Turkish-Syrian border, and turn south toward Dir Al-Zur. On the way, they bombed a radar station, crippling the Syrian air defense’s ability to identify the approach of foreign aircraft. Minutes <a id="pagebreak-rw_286"></a>later, they reached Dir Al-Zur; and from a carefully calculated distance, they launched Maverick air-to-surface missiles and half-ton bombs, hitting their target with precision. The Syrian reactor, intended to build atomic bombs for Israel’s destruction, was obliterated in seconds.</p><p id="p1443" class="text-indent">Prime Minister Olmert, anxious to avoid a Syrian military reaction, <span class="ref-pnum">established</span> urgent contact with the prime minister of Turkey, Tayyip <span class="ref-pnum">Erdogan</span>, and asked him to convey a message to President Assad. Israel had no intention of going to war with Syria, Olmert emphasized, but could not accept a nuclear Syria on its doorstep. But Olmert’s reassurance proved <span class="ref-pnum">unnecessary</span>. On the morning after the bombing, the reaction from <span class="ref-pnum">Damascus</span> was total silence. Not a word was uttered by government spokesmen. Only at three o’clock that afternoon was an official statement issued by the Syrian news agency. It stated that Israeli aircraft had penetrated Syrian air space at one <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>. “Our air force forced them to retreat, after [they had] dropped ammunition over a deserted area. There was no damage to people or equipment.”</p><p id="p1444" class="text-indent">The world media was desperate to learn how Mossad had managed to obtain photos and even videos from the interior of the Syrian reactor. ABC Television reported that Israel either had planted an agent inside the Syrian reactor or Mossad had recruited one of the engineers who had supplied it with the pictures of the facility.</p><p id="p1445" class="text-indent">In April 2008, some seven months after the destruction of the reactor, the American administration finally announced that the Syrian facility had been a nuclear reactor built with North Korean support and that “it was not designed for peaceful uses.” George W. Bush thought Olmert’s “execution of the strike” against the Syrian reactor had restored the confidence he had lost in the Israelis during their 2006 war against Lebanon, which Bush felt was bungled.</p><p id="p1446" class="text-indent">Officials in the U.S. intelligence community showed amazed <span class="ref-pnum">congressmen</span> and senators slides that made clear the similarity between the Syrian reactor and the North Korean Yongbyon reactor; a slide show with the <span class="ref-pnum">satellite</span> photos, drawings, and plans—as well as the videos—established the provenance of these materials.<a id="pagebreak-rw_287"></a></p><div class="decoration" id="decoration9"><p class="decoration-para" id="p1448">* * *</p></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara130"><span class="dropcap">I</span>srael succeeded in keeping the secret for just two weeks, during which it denied it had attacked the reactor. But then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, interviewed on a live newscast, declared: “When the cabinet takes action for Israel’s security, I give it my full backing … and here, too, I was a partner in this affair from the first moment and I gave it my full support.”</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line93"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara131"><span class="dropcap">A</span> final episode in the Syrian nuclear project took place eleven months later, on August 2, 2008. That evening, a convivial dinner party was taking place on the spacious veranda of a beach house at Rimal <span class="ref-pnum">El-Zahabiya</span>, north of the Syrian port of Tartus. The house, close to the water, had a spectacular view of the Mediterranean. The veranda, facing the dark waves, was a welcome refuge from the humidity of the Syrian coast. A soft sea breeze cooled the stifling midsummer heat. The guests, seated at an oblong table, were close friends of the villa’s owner, General Muhammad Suleiman, who had invited them for a relaxing weekend.</p><p id="p1449" class="text-indent">Suleiman was President Assad’s closest adviser on military and defense matters. He had supervised the building of the reactor and managed its security. In the highest circles of power in Syria he was regarded as Assad’s shadow. His office was in the palace, adjacent to that of the president, yet he was known only to a select few both inside and outside the country.</p><p id="p1450" class="text-indent">His name was never mentioned in the Syrian media, but Mossad knew of him and had followed his activities closely. The forty-seven-year-old <span class="ref-pnum">Suleiman</span> had studied engineering at Damascus University, where he had met and befriended another student, Bassel Al-Assad, the favorite son and heir apparent of President Hafez Al-Assad. When Bassel was killed in a road accident in 1994, Assad introduced Suleiman to his younger son, Bashar. Assad died of cancer in 2000 and Bashar replaced him as president, and then appointed Suleiman his confidant and trusted aide.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line94"></div><p class="calibre1" id="p1451"><span class="dropcap">S</span>uleiman soon became one of the most powerful men in Syria. <span class="ref-pnum">President</span> Assad charged him with supervision of all sensitive military <span class="ref-pnum">matters</span>. <a id="pagebreak-rw_288"></a>He became the senior liaison between the president and the Iranian intelligence services, especially on matters concerning their secret <span class="ref-pnum">cooperation</span> with terrorist organizations in the Middle East. He was also the primary Syrian contact with Hezbollah and maintained a close <span class="ref-pnum">relationship</span> with that organization’s military chief, Imad Mughniyeh. After Israel had withdrawn from the security zone in South Lebanon, in May 2000, Suleiman took charge of the transfer of weapons from Iran and Syria to Hezbollah, especially the delivery of long-range rockets. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, one such rocket scored a direct hit on the Israeli railway workshops in Haifa, killing eight workers. Later on, <span class="ref-pnum">Suleiman</span> supplied Hezbollah with Syrian-manufactured surface-to-air missiles, thus jeopardizing Israel’s air activities in Lebanon.</p><p id="p1452" class="text-indent">And Suleiman held another, unique and top-secret position: he was a senior member of the Syrian Research Committee that dealt with the <span class="ref-pnum">development</span> of long-range rockets, chemical and biological weapons, and nuclear research. He had overseen the liaison with North Korea, <span class="ref-pnum">coordinated</span> the shipment of reactor parts to Syria, and directed the security <span class="ref-pnum">measures</span> isolating the North Korean technicians and engineers working on the construction of the reactor.</p><p id="p1453" class="text-indent">Israel’s destruction of the reactor was a heavy blow for Suleiman. After recovering from the initial shock, he started planning another reactor, the location of which was yet to be decided. But Suleiman’s life had become more difficult. He knew now that he was wanted by both the American and Israeli secret services. So, before embarking on plans for his next stage, he took a few days leave at his home in Rimal El-Zahabiya. A quiet weekend with good friends and excellent food seemed the best way to alleviate his stress.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line95"></div><p class="calibre1" id="p1454"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom the center of his large table, Suleiman watched the waves <span class="ref-pnum">rolling</span> toward the beach. But he failed to notice two motionless figures crouching in the water some 150 yards away. They had swum in from the sea, where a boat had dropped them off about a mile from Suleiman’s home. Israeli naval commandos and expert sharpshooters, they carried <a id="pagebreak-rw_289"></a>scuba equipment and had made their way under water to the beach <span class="ref-pnum">opposite</span> the house. As their feet touched bottom, they stood and picked out Suleiman’s home. They studied the house and the veranda, looked at all the people seated at the table, and focused on their target: the general sitting between his guests.</p><p id="p1455" class="text-indent">At nine <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>., the sharpshooters calibrated their sights and adjusted the range. The veranda was crowded, and the two uninvited guests in their black diving suits wanted to make sure they could fire at the general <span class="ref-pnum">without</span> harming anybody else. They emerged from the water and took a few steps, then aimed their weapons equipped with silencers at Suleiman’s head. An electronic signal beeped in their earphones and they fired <span class="ref-pnum">simultaneously</span>. The shots were fatal. Suleiman’s head flew back and he collapsed forward, onto the food-laden table. The guests at first did not grasp what had happened. Only when they noticed the blood oozing from Suleiman’s head did they understand he had been shot. All hell broke loose on the veranda; some trying to come to their host’s aid, others crouching in fear or aimlessly running around, shouting and yelling. In the uproar, the two sharpshooters disappeared.</p><p id="p1456" class="text-indent">The <em class="calibre7">Sunday Times</em> published a slightly different version of the event. It said that the sharpshooters were members of the Israeli naval commando, Flotilla 13, who had arrived on the Syrian coast aboard a yacht belonging to an Israeli businessman, and had sailed back immediately after fulfilling their mission.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line96"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara132"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen the news reached Damascus, it caused a tremendous shock, but the government kept silent and did not respond to the media <span class="ref-pnum">coverage</span>. The military and security establishments were confused. How did the hit team reach Tartus, which was 140 miles away from Damascus? How did they escape? Was there no place in Syria where its leaders were safe?</p><p id="p1457" class="text-indent">Only after a few days a laconic communiqué was issued, announcing that “Syria is undertaking an investigation to find the perpetrators of this crime.” But the press in other Arab countries had not waited for this <span class="ref-pnum">official</span> <a id="pagebreak-rw_290"></a>reaction. From the outset, it had published extensive coverage, with detailed reports and speculation about the identity of the assassins. The Arab media focused on who had an interest in eliminating this general and pointed an accusing finger at Israel, claiming that Israel had carried out the assassination because of Suleiman’s role in the Dir Al-Zur reactor.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line97"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara133"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he reaction of the Western secret services was different. None shed a tear over Suleiman’s death. In June 2010, Flotilla 13 was decorated by the commander in chief of the Israel Defense Forces for “several feats of arms,” the nature of which was not revealed.</p><p id="p1458" class="text-indent">One may wonder if the honors bestowed on the naval commando unit are not, at least in part, in recognition of the Suleiman operation.</p></div>
