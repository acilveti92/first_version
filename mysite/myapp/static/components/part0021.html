				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Arthur!’ Sarah Draper raised her glove to her mouth in a delightfully demure gesture of surprise. ‘I thought you were returning to your regiment?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack felt the devilment stir within him. He was very aware how embarrassing his presence must be. He was meant to be safely on his way up country, far from Bombay and thus far from Sarah Draper’s bed. ‘I found new employment, ma’am. You know Major Ballard?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Mrs Draper.’ Ballard took a step forward. ‘How lovely to see you. I had heard a rumour that you were with the army, but I confess I am a little astonished to discover that it is true. I would have thought you would have preferred to remain in Bombay . . .’ He paused. ‘With your husband.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard was smooth, but Jack heard the bite in his words.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘James insisted that I come.’ Sarah Draper smiled tartly back at the major. Clearly the two were well known to each other, and Jack got the sense that there was little love lost between them. He watched Sarah closely, spotting the flash of anger in her eyes as she fixed them on Ballard’s face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I cannot write an account of the campaign from Bombay.’ She continued speaking with icy charm as she rose to Ballard’s challenge. ‘General Stalker was generous enough to listen to my plea and allow me to accompany the expeditionary force.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack did his best not to laugh aloud as she dropped the general’s name into the conversation. He didn’t doubt that Stalker had readily agreed. Beautiful women tended to get what they desired. Even crusty old generals could not deny them. Not that he could blame Stalker. He was very aware of his own infatuation with Sarah. If she made demands, then Jack knew he would oblige, and be delighted to do so.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard stiffened his back so that he stood ramrod straight as he responded to Sarah’s tone. ‘I would be delighted to offer my assistance should you require it. I would hate to see you inconvenienced in any way. An army on campaign is by its very a nature a rough and ready sort of affair. It may not be quite to your taste.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Why, thank you, Major, but I rather think I shall manage quite well. And if I find myself in any difficulties, well, I am not here alone.’ She turned and beckoned her escort into the conversation. ‘I should introduce my brother. Simon, you know Major Ballard, but I don’t think you know his colleague.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. He does. We met.’ Jack spoke first, fixing his eyes on the young man who had accosted him on the stairs shortly before Ballard had abducted him. It appeared that although Colonel Draper had allowed his wife to join the campaign, he was not foolish enough to do so without making sure she was accompanied by a suitable chaperone. And who better than a brother to safeguard a lady’s virtue? He let his hand fall to the handle of his sword, a gesture noticed by all. ‘However,’ he continued, ‘I’m afraid he did not have the manners to introduce himself.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The young man scowled. ‘My name is Simon Montfort. I suggest you remember it well.’ He said nothing further, but came to stand protectively at Sarah’s side.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am pleased to see you again, Simon.’ Ballard was watching Jack closely. The tension between the two younger men was evident as they regarded each other like bull mastiffs, their hackles raised. ‘This is Captain Fenris.’ It was obvious that the major was doing his best to ignore the atmosphere.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I shall not forget <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">your</span> name.’ Montfort’s tone was icy. He turned to Sarah. ‘We must be getting on, sister dear. We have much to do. As I’m sure do these gentlemen.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Nothing that cannot wait.’ Jack matched the other man’s tone. He turned his body, subtly isolating Montfort on the periphery of the conversation. He had seen enough of polite society to know how to cut someone dead. He focused his attention on Sarah. ‘Perhaps we can meet later on, at a more . . .’ he paused, as if testing the next word, ‘suitable hour.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was delighted at the reaction. Sarah’s face flushed scarlet, a shade that sat well on her pale English complexion. Montfort looked as if he was being force-fed a turd. The lack of subtlety in the remark was not lost on Ballard, who raised an eyebrow.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am sure we will all have too much to do.’ Montfort took a firm hold on his sister’s arm and made to push past the two officers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, of course.’ Ballard took a step backwards.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack made no effort to move. As he expected, Montfort tried to barge his way past. Instead of forcing a passage, he bounced off Jack’s shoulder, his hissed oath betraying the pain of the impact.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Out of my way, dammit.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stared hard into the young man’s eyes. It was only the second time they had met, and yet on both occasions it had seemed almost inevitable that they would come to blows. ‘You should learn to curb your tongue.’ He spoke in the calm tone of an adult dealing with an unruly child. ‘Otherwise you could find yourself in a whole boatload of trouble.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Captain Fenris.’ Ballard might not understand the source of the tension between the two men, but his anger was clear. ‘You appear to be in the way.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack continued to stare into Montfort’s eyes. He could sense the evil in the man. Montfort met his gaze evenly. A look of mocking satisfaction appeared on his face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do as you are told, old man. Stand aside.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack held his position for a moment longer before taking a large step to one side and sweeping his arm in a theatrical gesture to show the path was clear. The two civilians hurried after their rapidly departing porters.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What on earth was all that about?’ Ballard asked under his breath as Sarah Draper and her brother moved out of earshot. ‘You looked like you wanted to call the man out.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Just letting the little turd know where he stands.’ Jack smiled at the look on Ballard’s face. ‘It had to be done.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No it did not.’ Ballard scowled. ‘Do not forget who you are or why you are here. You ogled that poor woman like a dog on heat and then you tried to force her brother into a fight. It really is too much, Jack, too much indeed. Your new duties require you not to draw attention to yourself and I expect you to remember that. I do not want to have to bring the matter to your attention again.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack bowed his head as he weathered the lecture, but only to hide his delight. As she had passed, Sarah had flashed him a devilish smile that had sent a shiver of desire surging through his soul. It was all the invitation he needed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Sarah lay on her back, her face sheeted with perspiration. It was stuffy and close inside her tent, the air thick with the smell of sun-ripened canvas laced with French perfume.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nestled his head into the pillow. He was comfortable and contented despite the heavy air. He had arrived at Sarah’s tent in the dead of night. She had been awake, sitting at her writing desk working on the first chapters of her account. He had been welcomed in silence, her kisses the delightful acknowledgement that he had done the right thing in sneaking to her bed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t know how you work for that man. You know they call him the Devil?’ Sarah pushed herself up on to one elbow and looked at Jack, her fingers reaching forward to brush against his cheek.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He is not so bad. Besides, I don’t have much of a choice in the matter.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You could ask for a transfer.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled at the notion. He would have enjoyed the privilege of such liberty, something he had never had. As a redcoat he had gone wherever his regiment had been sent, no matter how dangerous or unpleasant. His attempts to become an officer had hardly improved his lot. ‘It doesn’t quite work like that.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes it does. Or you could sell out. Go back to England. Or purchase a commission in the Company.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack scowled. ‘Why? Are you so keen to be rid of me?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah’s face did not change. ‘I am merely thinking of how unpleasant it must be to work with that damn man. You should think of your future.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Now why would I do that?’ Jack chuckled. He reached across and pulled Sarah to him. She came willingly, nestling against his side. The warmth of her body pressed into his flesh. He did not want to dwell on the future. He had to enjoy the here and now.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Will you be involved in the assault on the fort?’ Her lips brushed against the skin of his upper arm as she asked the question. Jack shivered.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. The intelligence department does not fight.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah’s head lifted and she returned to her position on her side so that she could look at his face. ‘It sounds like you regret that.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What?’ Jack closed his eyes and feigned indifference. ‘No one wants to fight. Especially in an assault.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Why? You are soldiers. I thought you always wanted to fight.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack found he could not answer. There was nothing in battle that was to be sought out. Yet he was drawn to it nonetheless, his skill in the brutal cauldron of the fight the one thing he was certain of. It was not something he could explain, not even to the woman who had taken him into her bed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m sorry.’ Sarah broke the silence that had fallen over them. She had been studying his face, as if trying to read his thoughts. ‘I think you know very well what battle is like. I do not, and it was thoughtless of me to make light of it. I know what it is to suffer, to have memories that you lock away.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked at her. He thought he caught a glimpse of something more in her gaze, but it retreated quickly, pushed away by the sparkle of light that so captivated him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Will you tell me?’ He asked the question honestly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah stared back at him. For a moment the faraway look returned, but then she smiled before moving close to him once more. ‘So tell me what is to happen next. I need to understand, otherwise my account will make no sense.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack thought of pressing her, but he knew what it was to have demons, to have a past that had to be shackled away lest it rule a man’s soul. Sarah’s body was against his skin, and he did his best to savour the feeling and to forget the look of pain in her eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, it will be a hard fight. The enemy are well dug in and they will know we have landed. They know we must attack them and from which direction. The only thing they <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">don’t</span> know is when the attack is coming.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Surely it will take days for the army to be ready.’ Sarah was fiddling with her hair, twisting her fringe into a short plait before letting it unravel. ‘Stalker has only just landed. He cannot be prepared to launch an attack so soon.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We march tomorrow. These boys certainly know what they are about.’ Jack could not hide how impressed he was. In the Crimea, it had taken days to sort out the chaos of the landings. The disembarkation on to Persian soil had only taken place the previous day, yet already the army was ready to march. The sailors of the Indian navy had worked tirelessly to bring the thousands of soldiers ashore, along with the equipment, provisions, guns and stores they would need to start the campaign in earnest.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He does not need the whole army, surely?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He will use at least four battalions, maybe all five.’ Jack was enjoying lying on Sarah’s charpoy. It beat the sandy ground on which he had tried to sleep the previous night. The travelling bed had only been built for one, but he did not mind being pressed close to such a charming bedfellow.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The whole division. Why so many?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The assault is making Stalker nervous, and he’s right to worry.’ Jack knew from bitter experience just how hard it was to remove an enemy from a fixed defensive position. ‘He cannot risk failure. He knows that the longer the campaign goes on, the more likely it is that he’ll be replaced by someone more senior. His only hope of remaining in command is to give his masters a swift victory. So he cannot afford to delay.’ Jack enjoyed being able to recount the general’s plans. It made him feel part of the campaign’s inner circle. He only knew what was planned because Ballard had told him over dinner, but it did not matter. He wanted to impress the woman who had taken him to her bed, and prove that he was so much more than a typical junior officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So the men will have to fight simply to keep Stalker in his job.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Isn’t that always the reason?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Ah!’ She purred in approval. ‘You’re a cynic.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, I’m a soldier. We’re all cynics when it comes to laying down our lives.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah looked at Jack out of the corner of her eye. ‘You’re no ordinary soldier, Arthur. You’re quite different to all the rest.’ She gave up her temporary hairdressing and lifted herself up one elbow so she could look at him properly. She reached forward to trace the thick scar on his left side, the legacy of a bullet that had been meant to kill him. Her fingers walked soft patterns over his skin as she stroked each scar and blemish, the tantalising, gossamer-light touch setting him on fire. She leant forward and kissed the thick raised line on his left arm, the legacy of a wound that had cut his flesh to the bone.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Why don’t you like my brother?’ She whispered the question, her lips busy on his body.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Who said I don’t like him?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah lifted her head and pouted. ‘I think you have made it rather clear, or do you normally barge into people you like?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He walked into me.’ Jack frowned at her tone. He wanted her teasing his flesh, not picking at his mind.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t be childish.’ The rebuke was waspish. She pulled away, the memory of her touch leaving his skin tingling.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack sighed. He could not explain why he had taken such a dislike to Sarah’s brother. It was based on nothing more than instinct, but he had long ago learnt to trust his judgement. ‘He’s not my type.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s not an answer.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s all I have.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah’s eyes narrowed. ‘So will you at least tell me how you come to be here?’ She rolled on to her side to face him, once again reaching forward to stroke his flesh. ‘One minute you’re a lieutenant in an ordinary regiment of the line. The next you’re a dashing cavalry officer and a captain.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t recall spending all that much time in conversation when last we met.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah pouted and her fingers stilled their delicate touch. ‘The 15th are not with the division, so why are you here?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack sensed the change in the tone of her voice. ‘I’m on special duties.’ It was hard to keep the pride from his reply. He was an urchin from the foulest rookeries of east London, but now he was serving on the staff of a general, wrapped in all the finery of a hussar captain. It was hard not to be proud.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The answer seemed to appease her. ‘Special duties; that sounds intriguing.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So far it’s been as boring as hell.’ Jack thought of the hundreds of dull reports he had read. His life in Ballard’s department was far from glamorous.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m pleased you’re here.’ Sarah used her nails to trace the outline of the scar on his arm, sending shivers running through his body. ‘I would’ve hated being alone.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack closed his eyes to maintain control over his body. He had a feeling Sarah Draper was never alone for long. ‘Why are <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">you</span> here?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘For my book.’ Sarah was earnest as she explained the reason for her presence. ‘I plan to write a journal about the campaign. If that fat old sow Fanny Duberly can do it, then so can I. She was only the wife of a damn quartermaster and never got within a mile of the fighting, yet she is being treated like some Amazonian warrior.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack grimaced at Sarah’s turn of phrase. He was not accustomed to hearing a lady curse. He had heard a little about Fanny Duberly. She had successfully managed to avoid the authorities and stay close to her husband during the campaign in the Crimea. She had published her journal of the campaign the previous year and had become the talk of London. ‘I’m sure it will be fascinating.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah jabbed a sharp nail into the soft flesh above his hip. ‘Don’t patronise me, Arthur.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack opened his eyes to see Sarah staring at him coldly. ‘I was not patronising. I think your book will be very good indeed. I don’t think you would have it any other way.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His words made her smile. ‘It seems you’re getting to know me, Arthur.’ She leant forward, her fingernails tiptoeing down the side of his body. ‘I always get what I want.’ Jack gasped as she traced her nails lower, and Sarah smiled wider. ‘You would do well to learn that.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack let his eyes close, enjoying the sensation. He did not fully understand what he felt towards Sarah, but she enthralled him. He would happily submit to her will.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The hiss of a gas lamp woke him, and he blinked away sleep as he struggled to adjust to the light in the tent. He propped himself on his elbows and looked across to see Sarah bent low over a small table.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What are you doing?’ His voice was croaky and he cleared his throat as he came fully awake. He had been dreaming of the Crimea and he could feel the sheen of sweat cold on his flesh. He shivered as he forced the nightmare away.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Writing.’ Sarah didn’t deign to turn round, but kept her nose pressed close to the page.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At this time?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘One must write when one has the muse,’ she answered, but it was clear she was concentrating on her work.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack rose from the charpoy and walked over to the table, where he stood in silence and watched as she wrote, listening to the scratching of her steel nib across the paper. Every few moments her free hand rose to push her hair back over her ear, where it remained in place for only a short while before it fell back, forcing her to repeat the gesture. Jack thought it was one of the most endearing things he had ever seen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You should go back to sleep.’ Sarah lifted her head and turned to face him, speaking softly as she became aware of his continued scrutiny.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I should be saying the same to you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m a big girl, Arthur.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I can see that.’ She was dressed in only a thin silk gown. With the gas lamp behind her, Jack could see every curve of her silhouette through the shimmering fabric.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His comment was not well received. ‘Don’t be tiresome, Arthur.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">She sounded weary, and Jack was made to feel boorish. He walked back to the bed and retreated under the covers, letting his head fall on to the pillow, doing as he was told. He was learning that it was the best tactic when faced with a resilient enemy. As he lay and listened to her pen working quickly and without pause, he wondered whether he would feature in her account.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He drifted off to sleep, the rare comfort of the charpoy lulling him to his rest.</p>
