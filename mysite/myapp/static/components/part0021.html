<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter016">SIXTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">A damp chill hung over the courtyard as I peered out from the mouth of my staircase at twenty minutes to midnight, though the heavy clouds that had brought the day’s punishing rain had broken at last to allow the merest glimmer of moonlight to illuminate the slick flagstones. I was grateful for the pale light, since it had allowed me to read the clock on the north range from my window – I had been pacing my room in a state of pent-up anticipation since the end of supper – but I was now anxious that I should not also find myself lit up like a spectacle as I tried to leave the college unobserved. Keeping close in to the shadows, I crept the length of the south range wall and then along the west towards the tower, praying that Cobbett would be awake. Twice I started at a noise, thinking I had heard something stirring in the opposite corner, pressing myself tight against the damp stone, but eventually convinced myself that I had heard nothing but the nocturnal antics of a fox or owl outside the walls, a noise now dulled by the thudding of my own blood in my ears. All the windows facing the courtyard were dark, save for a flickering light in the upper storey of the rector’s lodgings; if Sophia had still not come home, I thought, no wonder the poor man could not sleep. As I passed the west range, I wondered if Gabriel Norris and Thomas Allen had returned; neither had been present at supper and it seemed strange that both should have disappeared after the discovery of Ned’s body. William Bernard was also missing, an absence more noticeable for the fact that none of his colleagues had mentioned it at High Table, despite the frequent glances at his empty place.</p>
<p class="indented">Under the tower archway, I tapped gently on Cobbett’s little arched window; I was pleased to see that candlelight burned within and to my surprise, the door opened almost immediately. Pressing a grimy finger to his lips, the old porter shuffled with painful slowness towards the gate, a small lantern in his right hand, glancing fearfully out at the shadowy courtyard as he did so. He handed me the lantern and I watched as his arthritic fingers sorted expertly through the enormous bunch of keys hanging from his belt, selecting one with barely a sound. The gate creaked in complaint as it opened, the sound like nothing so much as the trunk of an ancient tree bending in a storm, and we both froze for a moment until we were satisfied that there was no movement from the buildings behind us.</p>
<p class="indented">Cobbett motioned to me to keep the lantern.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Tap on the street window when you come back,’ he reminded me in a hoarse whisper. ‘Never fear, I shall hear you. And take care abroad in the streets, sir. Have your wits about you.’ His face in the candlelight was unusually serious, so I nodded with equal solemnity as I stepped through the gate into the mire of St Mildred’s Lane. The hinges groaned mightily again as Cobbett heaved the gate closed behind me and a moment later I heard his key turning in the lock with an ominous finality.</p>
<p class="indented">I had barely passed the walls of Jesus College and was almost upon the place where St Mildred’s Lane meets Sommer Lane when I whipped around sharply on my heels, my hand on the knife, convinced now that I had heard the unmistakeable sound of a footstep in a puddle somewhere at my back. I held the lantern up, peering frantically into the blackness of the lane I had just walked along, but its circle of light barely reached beyond the length of my arm and only made the darkness seem more impenetrable. I almost called out for whoever was there to show himself but stopped myself at the last moment, thinking it best not to draw more attention to myself.</p>
<p class="indented">I trudged on through the muddy street, staying close to the solid blackness of the city wall on my right as I followed its line down Sommer Lane towards the North Gate. Again, the quiet splash of a footfall behind me, like the ones my own boots were making in the brimming ruts left in the road from the day’s rain; again I spun around, this time drawing the knife, hissing ‘Who’s there?’ in so low a voice as to be barely audible. This time I was sure I detected something in the deep shadows; not so much a movement as a stirring of the air, the chill mist reassembling itself into the space where a man had been moments earlier. I had no doubt now that someone was following me, but only a few yards ahead I saw the reassuring bulk of St Michael’s church hard against the city wall, and beside it the lights on the watchtower over the gate. I took a deep breath and, replacing the knife at my belt, reached inside the pocket of my breeches for the few coins I had earlier taken out as bribes for the watchmen, thinking it best not to let them see the full purse I carried.</p>
<p class="indented">Two young men carrying pikes and smelling strongly of ale stepped forward half-heartedly as I neared the gate.</p>
<p class="indented">‘State your business,’ the taller one said, as if he did not care either way. He ostentatiously bit the groat I handed him, while I anxiously glanced over my shoulder for any sign of my pursuer, but I could see nothing beyond the spheres of lamplight. When my bribe was judged authentic, I was ushered through the gate and found myself alone outside the city wall.</p>
<p class="indented">The inn yard was shrouded in shadow, overhung by a muffled silence which seemed taut with anticipation. I could see no light in any of the windows, and the only illumination came from my lantern. From somewhere in the dense dark to my right came the soft whinny of a horse, the shifting of its weight in slumber, close by. I held up the light to see where I should go.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Put that out, you fool. Would you have the watchmen on us?’ hissed a man’s voice at my ear, his breath warm against my cheek. My heart leapt and I almost dropped the lantern with the shock, but managed to reach inside the glass and snuff out the candle. The figure who had spoken overtook me and crossed the yard without hesitation, his cloak swishing around his legs as he walked. A sliver of moonlight penetrated the clouds and in its thin gleam I saw other shadows come to life, more figures gliding silently through the still air to the back of the inn building, all cloaked and hooded. For a moment the sight reminded me of rising for Matins in the early hours at San Domenico, the hooded figures looking like nothing so much as the monks among whom I had spent my youth. I followed the shapes I could make out to a small door, which closed just as I reached it. I could just make out the shape of a grille at head height, so I leaned towards it and whispered ‘<em class="calibre2">Ora pro nobis</em>.’ For a moment there was only silence, but then the door opened a crack and out of the shadows a pale hand beckoned me inside.</p>
<p class="indented">I slipped through the gap into a narrow passageway which, from the smell of stale food, appeared to run alongside the inn’s kitchen. From his sheer size, I guessed that the person who had admitted me was young Humphrey Pritchard, the pot-boy; whether he had recognised me, I did not know. He ushered me along the passage, which ended in a rickety-looking staircase that curved around to the next floor. One tallow candle burned low in a sconce halfway up, filling the narrow stairwell with its bitter smoke. Footsteps creaked on the stairs behind me and I hastened my climb, emerging on to a landing with a low, beamed ceiling and uneven floor. I noticed that the windows had been hung with black cloth to prevent the candlelight from showing to the world outside. Still unsure of where to go, I followed the landing to its end, where a low door stood ajar; tentatively pushing this open, I found myself in a small room crowded with hooded figures who stood expectantly, heads bowed, all facing towards a makeshift altar at one end, where three wax candles burned cleanly in tall wrought silver holders before a dark wooden crucifix bearing a silver figure of Christ crucified.</p>
<p class="indented">From the anonymous depths of our hoods, my fellow congregants and I furtively regarded one another, though in the dim candlelight all the faces I glimpsed wore the same mask-like effects of the dancing flames, features elongated, eyes submerged in pools of shadow. Then suddenly, a tall figure across the room turned towards me, the light caught his face for a moment as his eyes met mine and I recognised with a jolt Master Richard Godwyn, the librarian of Lincoln College. Surprise and fear registered on his face in the instant before he dropped his eyes to the floor, folding his hands prayerfully in front of him. I wondered how many of these others, if I could only see them clearly, would turn out to be men I already knew, creeping through the sleeping city under cover of darkness to live their secret forbidden life. I could not help but admire their courage, though I no longer shared their faith; after all, had I not also once risked my life in defying the beliefs the authorities prescribed for me? Was I not, in a sense, still doing so? In that moment, glancing around the little congregation of fourteen souls, I was seized by the enormity of my own task there. I was the wolf among the flock, the one who wore the same uniform and would speak the same responses, but beneath my right arm I felt the weight of Sir Francis Walsingham’s purse – money I carried to betray these defiant faithful people to prison or perhaps to death. It was all very well for Walsingham to talk in the abstract about the threat to the realm, but could this Mass really be considered treason? I found it hard to believe that any of the ordinary people gathered here in the night to celebrate a rite denied them on pain of death were secretly plotting to assassinate the queen or tip off French forces. Was their faith alone sufficient reason to deliver them up to the Privy Council’s version of justice, I asked myself, and could I justify that to my own conscience? I remembered Thomas Allen’s palpable fear of the interrogation methods the queen’s ministers used against those they accused of treason. I felt suddenly horribly exposed, as if my treacherous intent could be visible to those around me; at that moment a hand closed tightly around my wrist and I raised my eyes to find myself staring into the luminous blue eyes of Rowland Jenkes. He gave me a hard look, then nodded at me once in what I took to be affirmation, an almost-smile flickered over his lips and he let go of my arm, turning expectantly towards the door through which we had entered.</p>
<p class="indented">A stillness descended on us, an audible intake of breath as the door began to open and I felt in that small room, as I had not for many years, a tiny shiver along my spine at the old magic of the Mass. These people among whom I stood, disguised, truly believed that they were in the presence of a holy mystery; believed it with a pure faith that I had long forgotten, and it was this, I thought, that a man like Walsingham could not hope to understand. It was the belief in this miracle that would draw them back time after time, despite the threats of death and punishment, defiantly to keep this flame alive, and the honesty of their faith was a little humbling.</p>
<p class="indented">The priest who had entered wore a white garment like an alb that reached to his feet, though it was hooded and the hood drawn up, obscuring his face. A green stole hung around his neck. He took his few steps to the altar with solemn dignity, eyes downcast but his bearing erect, holding out the veiled chalice before him. Upon reaching the altar, he made a deep bow, and I saw from the manner of it that he was not a young man, and the physical gesture cost him. But I could not prevent myself from gasping when he straightened and drew back his hood; the celebrant priest was Doctor William Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">He laid the chalice reverently on the left side of the altar, lifted a green velvet burse from on top and, with a forefinger and thumb, removed the delicate corporal from the burse, unfolded and laid the white linen square in the centre of the altar. Then he placed the veiled chalice carefully on top. The server who accompanied him shuffled nervously; he could not have been more than nineteen, a student, I guessed, and cast nervous glances around him as he stood, bareheaded, at Bernard’s shoulder, as exposed in all this hooded company as if he had been naked.</p>
<p class="indented">Facing the altar, Bernard made the sign of the cross from forehead to breastbone and from left shoulder to right with his right hand.</p>
<p class="indented"><em class="calibre2">‘In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.’</em></p>
<p class="indented">The air in the small room seemed charged, all of us poised there as if on a knife edge, our nerves taut with the danger involved in this rite unfolding before us, of which we were all part – even I, who also stood outside it, I too was implicated. Every sudden unfamiliar noise – the cry of an owl, the creak of the inn’s old timbers – caused a stiffening among the congregation, an invisible wave of fear that caught and held us for a moment, before the soft hush of breath cautiously released.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Introibo ad altare Dei</em>,’ pronounced Bernard, quiet authority in his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">The wind gusted suddenly through the wooden shutters, billowing out the black cloths over the windows and making the candles gutter wildly; the young server swivelled his head around in panic, as if someone might have entered, but Bernard proceeded, solemn and imperturbable, with the ceremony he performed as if its every word and gesture were ingrained in his very nature.</p>
<p class="indented">There was no music, and the responses of the congregation were muted, barely whispered, as if someone might be listening at the door. We knelt as one as the Mass progressed according to its prescribed rhythms and I remembered again, with a stab of nostalgia, how those words and gestures had framed my own life for so many years; now, as I repeated the phrases, it was as if they no longer had life in them. Bernard took the Host from a small brass pyx and after he had elevated it and drunk from the chalice, he turned to face the congregation.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi,</em>’ he intoned, and I raised my head to find his eyes boring directly into me. My breath caught in my throat; in that moment it seemed he had penetrated my disguise and seen straight through to the very secrets of my soul. In case I had mistaken the look, beside me Jenkes laid a warning hand on my arm. I understood his meaning; though I had been admitted among the faithful that night, Jenkes and Bernard had not forgotten that I was excommunicate. I was not to think of taking the Host with the rest. They need not have feared; I had not taken communion since I left the monastery, out of some vestige of respect or superstition, or both. But as the small congregation rushed forward, dropping to their knees with mouths hungrily gaping open like baby birds, I shrank back towards the wall, afraid that my non-participation would mark me out clearly as a spy; this was, after all, the heart of the rite and abstinence would immediately provoke suspicion. But perhaps Jenkes had warned them beforehand, because although my withdrawal attracted a few curious glances, these were fleeting, and I blended back into the group, muttering ‘<em class="calibre2">Deo gratias</em>’ to Bernard’s ‘<em class="calibre2">Benedicamus Domino</em>.’</p>
<p class="indented">With the Mass said, the atmosphere of charged anticipation seemed to dissolve, and the congregation appeared restless and anxious to be gone. I kept my place by the door as they began to file out, peering as closely as I could into hooded faces as they passed me, dropping my eyes if they returned my gaze. Jenkes’s long fingers closed around my wrist, signalling me to stay while the others left. One of the last to leave, a short figure with his hands tucked beneath his cloak in a monkish posture, paused and looked directly at me; at that moment the candles guttered again and I gasped as the sudden surge of light showed me his face. Adam, the rector’s servant, stared back at me, mirroring my own expression of disbelief. He hesitated a moment, as if unsure whether to speak, but Jenkes gave him a hard look and he hurried through the door with the rest.</p>
<p class="indented">At last I was left alone with Jenkes, who removed his hood, and the tall, solid figure of Humphrey Pritchard, who began to busy himself tidying the room and putting away the trappings of the ceremony. He left the altar candles, now burning lower and with feeble light. Jenkes looked at me appraisingly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So, to business,’ he said softly. ‘Please, take off your cloak. You are among friends now. Did you bring your purse, Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">I lowered my hood and held his gaze steadily.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you bring the book, Master Jenkes?’</p>
<p class="indented">His ruined face cracked slowly into a smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The book. First tell me what you are willing to pay for this manuscript?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would need to see it first,’ I said evenly. ‘What do you ask for it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is a difficult question, Bruno. For the worth of an object – any object – depends wholly on another’s desire for it, does it not? This book, for instance. I have only met one other man who wanted it as much as you appear to, and he was willing to pay me a great deal. More, perhaps, than you carry in your bulging purse.’ He eyed my doublet, a hungry glint in his eye.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who?’ I asked, a cold fear spreading through my stomach. ‘You didn’t sell it?’</p>
<p class="indented">At that moment, the door opened; I started, but it was only William Bernard, no longer wearing his vestments but dressed again in his shabby academic’s gown and a thin cloak, his hands clasped behind his back.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was just telling Doctor Bruno of the man who wanted to buy the Greek manuscript from Dean Flemyng’s collection – the one you saved from the purge of ’69,’ Jenkes informed him. Bernard nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I discovered the manuscript buried in an old chest when I first became librarian of Lincoln,’ he explained. ‘My predecessor had been either unable to read it or unaware of what it was, but I recognised it immediately and understood that in the right hands it could be extremely valuable – and extremely dangerous.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you stole it?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard frowned.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I did no such thing. The college took an annual inventory of the library’s collection – any disappearance would have been noticed. But the Lord provides to those who keep the faith – in 1569 the Queen’s Visitors carried out a purge of the college libraries, as you know, and in their haste to remove offending items it was a simple matter to spirit away some of the unwanted manuscripts. I had already told Rowland that I had found the lost writings of Hermes Trismegistus, the book Ficino refused to translate because he would not be responsible for the consequences to Christendom. I am not sure he believed me until I was able to place it into his hands, though.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes held up a hand as if to absolve himself.</p>
<p class="indented">‘As soon as I read the book, I did not doubt it could be genuine,’ he said. ‘This was the book Cosimo de’ Medici had paid a fortune to have fetched from the ruins of Byzantium, yet he never got to read it. I knew there was one man who would pay me whatever I demanded to have this book in his library.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You may know him,’ Bernard said slyly, ‘for he was tutor to your great friend Philip Sidney. I speak of the sorcerer John Dee, astrologer to the heretic bastard Elizabeth.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then –’ I looked from one to the other, my hopes collapsing as I spoke – ‘then John Dee has the book? You sold it to him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, and yes,’ Jenkes said, stepping forward with his palms spread wide to demonstrate his helplessness in the matter. ‘I sold him the book for a very large sum – we had exchanged letters and Dee travelled to Oxford personally to make the transaction. But there was an unfortunate intervention – either by Providence or some other power.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What do you mean?’ I was impatient now, and tiring of this game of cat and mouse. From the corner of my eye I could see Humphrey Pritchard lolling against the wall by the blacked-out window, picking bits of communion wafer from his teeth. I wondered, with a sense of apprehension, why he was still there, watching us with detached curiosity, and why Jenkes and Bernard did not object to his presence.</p>
<p class="indented">‘On the road back to London, Dee was set upon by highwaymen and most brutally assaulted. He was fortunate to escape with his life, but his possessions were all stolen, including the manuscript he carried.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes related this with perfect unconcern; at the same time he gave an almost imperceptible flick of his fingers and Humphrey moved away from the window towards us.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And this was your doing?’ I asked, turning to keep Humphrey in my sight. ‘Did you have the manuscript recovered?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">I</em>?’ Jenkes affected affront. ‘You think me capable of such underhanded dealings, Bruno? I assure you, I am nothing but honest in my business affairs, nor am I such a fool as to make an enemy of one so close to the queen’s favourites.’ He gave me an odd look as he said this, then exchanged a glance with Bernard. ‘No – it appeared that Doctor Dee was not the only person with an interest in the subject, who was prepared to obtain the manuscript at any cost.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then where is it now?’ I demanded, snapping around to face him. ‘If you do not have it, why this charade of asking me to bring my purse?’ But even as I spoke, the knowledge of what was to come spread through my veins like icy water; I whipped around towards Humphrey but I was not fast enough and he had both my arms pinioned behind me before I could duck away from his grasp. In the same instant, it seemed, Jenkes had lunged forward and snatched the silver-handed knife from my belt; with its tip pressed to the base of my throat, he reached inside my doublet, first one side and then the other, until he found Walsingham’s purse. Bringing it into the light, he threw it casually in the air and caught it again with his free hand, testing its weight. Bernard simply stood and watched with his arms hidden behind his back and his face impassive.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cry out and I will slit your gizzard like a pig before the sound has left your throat,’ Jenkes hissed, pressing the knife in closer.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was all a lie, then?’ I asked through gritted teeth, as I struggled uselessly against Humphrey Pritchard’s iron embrace. ‘The story about the book?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, no.’ Jenkes looked almost hurt. ‘The story is true in every particular, Bruno. The book was stolen from Dee by one who must have known he was carrying it – but whoever attacked him was not in my employ, and I do not believe Dee ever found out where it was taken, or why. That is no longer my concern. No, I have not lied to you, Doctor Bruno. But I do not think you can say the same.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know what you mean,’ I said, panic rising in my voice as the tip of Jenkes’s knife pricked against my skin. ‘In what do you think I have lied?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where did you get this money?’ he hissed, holding up the purse and shaking it, all traces of his unctuous politeness vanished. ‘How does an exiled, itinerant writer come to Oxford with a purse this full, I ask myself? Who pays you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have a stipend from King Henri of France,’ I spat, trying to wrest my arms free; Humphrey only pulled them tighter behind me, and I realised that all I would achieve in struggling would be to dislocate my own shoulders. I stopped moving and slumped forwards, still holding Jenkes’s stare. ‘I travel under his patronage – anyone will tell you that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You travel with Sir Philip Sidney, who has the patronage of his uncle, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, lover of the whore Elizabeth. And Dudley’s whole interest, like that of all the Privy Council, lies in ridding Oxford of those who remain loyal to the pope, whom you are charged with rooting out for him like a pig after truffles. Is it not so?’ He stepped closer to me and raised his elbow, so that I had to force my head as far back as I could to keep the knife from piercing my throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know nothing of the earl’s interests – I have never laid eyes on him!’ I croaked, a sharp pain shooting down the side of my neck from the strain.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You dissemble well, Bruno – I expected as much. It must be an exceptional man who can keep ahead of the Inquisition for seven years. But you do not fool me. You are a schismatic and a heretic and you seek to prosper and revenge yourself on the Catholic Church by betraying those who keep the faith you scorned.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have no reason to think so,’ I protested, genuinely alarmed now by the fierce light in Jenkes’s eyes. ‘On what grounds do you accuse me?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘On what grounds?’ He gave a short, hacking laugh and took a step back, relaxing his arm, though he did not lower the knife from my throat. ‘What – apart from your intimacy with Sidney and the money you use to bribe your informers? Explain for me, then, your interest in the deaths at Lincoln College. For whose sake do you concern yourself so diligently with finding the killer?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What informers?’ I lurched forward again unintentionally and felt something pull sharply in my shoulder as Humphrey wrenched my arm back tighter. ‘I was not convinced by the account of Doctor Mercer’s death, that is all – I thought others might be in danger if the killer was not found. Which proved to be the case,’ I added pointedly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What touching charity,’ Jenkes said, almost without opening his lips. ‘Well, then, let us try another question – why did you invite Thomas Allen to eat with you?’</p>
<p class="indented">My face must have betrayed my surprise, because he smiled thinly and tilted his head to one side.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Have you never observed, Bruno, how a blind man can develop the hearing of a dog, to compensate for his lost faculty? Just so I, who have no ears, make up for my loss by having many eyes, that see into every corner.’ He laughed drily at this, as if he had rehearsed it earlier and found it pleasing. When I failed to show my appreciation, he lunged again, needling the knife tip in closer. ‘What were you asking Allen? What did he tell you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He told me nothing of any worth,’ I panted, trying to twist my neck away from the point of the blade. ‘He talked of his studies, his worries about girls – the trivia of a young man’s mind only.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do not lie to me again, Bruno,’ Jenkes said through his teeth, his voice calm and cold. ‘You deliberately sought out the one man in Oxford who wants to see us all destroyed.’ Then he jerked the knife swiftly to one side and there was a moment’s pause before a searing pain shot up my neck and he held up the blade to my eye level, its blade stained crimson. ‘Look how you tremble to see your own blood. It’s but a nick,’ he said dismissively, ‘you’ve had worse shaving. But see how you bleed, even from a little cut. Think how your blood will stain the ground when I cut your neck right across.’</p>
<p class="indented">I closed my eyes, my mind spinning wildly as I tried to think of ways I might try to escape. None came obviously to mind.</p>
<p class="indented">‘If Thomas Allen wishes to destroy your group, why would he not report what he knows?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah.’ Jenkes studied me for a moment. ‘I see there is much you do not yet know, Bruno. It is not that simple. He cannot do it himself. But I cannot let you pass on whatever he has told you about us.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If you mean to kill me, then,’ I said, keeping my voice as even as I could manage, ‘at least tell me why you killed those men at Lincoln. Satisfy that curiosity for me.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes frowned, then looked over at Bernard as if for approval.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What a strange last request, Bruno. And one I cannot satisfy, for I did not kill Mercer or Coverdale, nor the boy, and I do not know for certain who did. I am as curious to find the answer as you are.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then why do you wish to prevent anyone finding out? They came here for Mass, did they not? Coverdale and Mercer – they were part of your group. Do you not care that they have been violently killed, and more of you may be in danger?’ I asked, looking from one to the other in confusion, the cut in my throat now stinging fiercely.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Their deaths have provoked too many questions,’ Bernard said, in the same clear, solemn tone with which he had pronounced the Mass. ‘Oxford men would know well enough to leave those questions unanswered, but you are not an Oxford man and your insistence on ferreting out the truth would expose us all in the end. I’m sorry to say that your curiosity has been the undoing of you.’</p>
<p class="indented">He sounded genuinely sorrowful as he said this. For a moment I felt the room spin; my heart seemed to have stopped beating and I lost all sensation in my arms and legs as I realised without any doubt that they did mean to kill me and that it was quite possible I would not be able to talk my way out of it. My bowel gave a spasm at the same time, but I tensed every muscle and brought it under control. I would at least not shame myself that way.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But,’ I gasped, battling to catch my ragged breaths, ‘then this killer is <em class="calibre2">your</em> enemy – it is he who is causing these questions to be asked! He scrawled the sign of the Catherine Wheel on the wall in Coverdale’s blood – it is as if he wants to point the finger at you and your group, while it is your people he is killing! Surely, then, it can only help you if I try to find him?’</p>
<p class="indented">A sharp look passed between them at the mention of the symbol; Bernard’s face hardened into knowing anger and Jenkes seemed rattled for the first time since he had turned on me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Say that again,’ he hissed, forcing the knife into the tender skin of the cut he had made so that I yelped in pain and bit my lip to stop myself crying out. Bernard took a step closer and shook his head almost imperceptibly; Jenkes withdrew the knife a fraction. ‘On the wall, you say? How many people saw this?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Apart from me, only Rector Underhill and the bursar, Slythurst,’ I said, almost in a whisper. ‘The rector had it removed before the coroner arrived.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good.’ Bernard nodded almost to himself. ‘Well, then, Rowland, let us get this thing done and be on our way, or we shall risk being seen.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, wait!’ I cried, as quietly as I could. ‘I can help you find him if you let me go back to college and continue my search. Come – we are on the same side.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes laughed abruptly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We are not on the same side, Bruno,’ he replied. ‘Do you not see? You think you are hunting this killer down but all the time he is using you to betray us. He wants to lead you to us, to make you connect the deaths to us and probe into the secrets of our network, so that you can take the know ledge back to Sidney and your friends in London and think it was your own conclusion.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You speak as if you know who he is,’ I said, feeling that if I could only keep him talking I might deter him from the course of action he had decided. But Jenkes, it seemed, was tired of talking; he nodded towards Bernard, who finally drew his hands out from behind his back to reveal a length of thin cord.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have seen and heard too much, Bruno,’ Jenkes said matter-of-factly, his knife still quivering at my throat as Bernard disappeared behind me and my wrists were roughly pulled together and bound. ‘But I will find out what Thomas Allen told you, and whether you have passed it on, before I send you to the Devil. You can tell me willingly or otherwise, it is up to you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why do you not ask Thomas Allen?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Because he is not here. But do not worry – I think it unlikely that Thomas Allen will see tomorrow’s sunrise either.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will kill him too?’ I gasped.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not I, Bruno.’ Jenkes shook his head and offered an enigmatic smile. ‘Not I. I have not touched Thomas Allen for the sake of his father, who kept faith with us even under hard torture. But Thomas should not have spoken to you. Now others may not be so scrupulous.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am a guest with the royal party,’ I spluttered, grasping now at straws, ‘my murder would be a scandal – it will lead the magistrate straight to this place.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes shook his head slowly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You badly underestimate my intelligence, Bruno, I almost find it insulting. Even a member of a royal party may take a fancy to visit the stews in the dead of night – after all, that is no more than anyone would expect of a foreigner and a papist. And not knowing the bad streets in that part of town, he might easily find himself the victim of violent robbers – especially if he will go abroad carrying such a fat purse. It will be an embarrassment to the royal party, no doubt, but they will quickly dissociate themselves from you. What do you think, William?’ he asked, raising his head towards Bernard, who was still tying my arms while Humphrey held them in place. ‘Shall we leave his body to be found outside one of the boy-houses, or is that a humiliation too far?’</p>
<p class="indented">When Bernard did not answer, he merely shrugged and continued:</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will be back before first light, when I have made the arrangements. I leave you in Humphrey’s care while you consider what you are going to tell me about your conversation with Thomas Allen.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You would kill me to protect yourselves?’ I asked, flailing as Humphrey lowered me with surprising gentleness to the floor and Bernard moved around to tie my ankles with another length of cord. Jenkes studied me severely.</p>
<p class="indented">‘To protect the <em class="calibre2">faith</em>, Bruno,’ he answered eventually, reproach in his voice. ‘Everything I do is to protect and preserve our persecuted faith, therefore it is no sin in God’s eyes.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What of the Sixth Commandment?’ My voice sounded choked and unusually high. ‘Thou shalt not kill?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I begin with the First Commandment. <em class="calibre2">Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven image</em>.’ His eyes narrowed and he brought his face very close to mine, so that I could almost count the blackened pores on his nose. ‘This country – <em class="calibre2">my</em> country, Bruno, for I was born and remain an Englishman – <em class="calibre2">my</em> idolatrous country, then, has broken this commandment. The heretic bastard of the whore Anne Boleyn has set herself up as a rival to the Holy Father himself and the souls of her people are in mortal peril. To combat such heresy is holy war, not murder. But to show that I am no barbarian, Bruno, Father William will hear your confession before you die, if you choose to be reconciled to the Holy Mother Church.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will not confess myself to you,’ I said, through my teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes did not seem put out.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No matter – it is between your conscience and your God,’ he shrugged, unwinding from around his neck a dirty linen scarf. Seizing my nose hard, he pinched it between his fingers until I was forced to open my mouth to breathe; as soon as I did so, he stuffed the scarf into my mouth until my jaw was stretched painfully wide and I was gagging on the material, unable to make any sound. For a hideous, panicked moment I thought he meant to suffocate me and began to struggle violently, but he released my nose and gave me a lingering look of distaste.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You had better search his room in the college,’ he said brusquely to Bernard, who nodded. Jenkes once again rummaged inside my jerkin and found the key attached to my belt; quickly he tore it off and threw it to Bernard. It was of little consolation now, but at least I had the sheet with the copy of the cipher from Mercer’s almanac tucked inside my shirt, and there was nothing in the chamber at Lincoln that could link me to Walsingham. I cursed my own stupidity in not sending word to Sidney of my plans; only Cobbett knew that I had gone out, but he would have no idea of where to look for me, or even that I was in danger, until my body was found tomorrow morning lying in an alley outside a whorehouse. I shuddered, the ache in my jaw worsening as I struggled to swallow my own saliva without choking on the scarf.</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes gave me a last analytic glance, bent to check my bonds were tight enough, then motioned to Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will see you soon enough, Bruno. Think carefully about what you want to tell me. This face of mine will seem the face of an angel compared to the way you’ll look if I have to force it out of you. I hope that won’t be necessary.’</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard peered down at me, his lined face steely yet clouded with regret. Then he pulled the hood of his cloak around his ears and swept out of the room, leaving me alone with Humphrey Pritchard.</p>
