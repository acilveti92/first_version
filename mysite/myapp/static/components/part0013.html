				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The street was dark. A few gaslights lit the main streets in town but in the long rows of terraced housing behind the new train station the darkness was left to smother the backstreets in an impenetrable gloom. The days had finally started to draw out but the evenings still pressed in quickly. In the poorer areas of town, little spare money could be wasted even on the cheapest tallow candles, so the darkness was left to rule unchallenged.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack dawdled his way closer to the house where Molly lived with her mother. He was smartly dressed in his best uniform, as was required to pass the guard and be allowed into town. He did his best to avoid stepping in any of the unsavoury mess that littered the ground. He wished he had had the foresight to bring a lantern and he prayed he would arrive at Molly’s house without his well-polished boots smeared with some noxious substance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There were few people around now darkness had set in, the people crammed into these small terraced houses seeking whatever rest they could get before returning to their work in the morning. Occasional raised voices echoed down the street as people vented their anger and frustration on one another, and in the house next door to Molly’s a baby wailed, its plaintive cry reverberating through the gloomy street.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With a determination he did not feel, Jack rapped on the scarred front door of number twenty-seven. The house behind its sturdy door was silent.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sound of bolts scraping gave Jack just enough time to pull one last time at his uniform before the door was cautiously opened and an anxious eye peered round its edge.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Jack!’ The relief in the familiar voice was clear. Few respectable people welcomed visitors once night had fallen and Jack had expected to waste half the night on the doorstep persuading those inside to lower their guard and unbar the door. ‘What are you doing here at this time of night?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly opened the door wide, quickly ushering Jack into the narrow hallway while nervously looking down the quiet street to see how many of the neighbours’ curtains were twitching.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The house stank of boiled cabbage and the harsh carbolic soap the family borrowed from the laundry for use at home. Molly held a single candle in a holder and in its flickering flame Jack thought she had never looked so lovely. She had discarded the linen cap that contained her unruly locks during the day and she wore her hair down. In the dim light she looked almost angelic, her face now devoid of the constant red flush he was so used to seeing in the heat of the laundry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You shouldn’t really be here this late. It isn’t proper.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack removed his shako and held it awkwardly in front of him. ‘It’s a bit late to worry about that now.’ He smiled as he saw a flush of crimson on Molly’s cheeks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">She turned to call up the stairs. ‘It’s alright, Mam. It’s just Jack. He won’t be staying long.’ She fixed Jack with a challenging glare, daring him to try any more of his ribald humour.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But Jack was there on a more serious errand. He looked at Molly as earnestly as he could. ‘I haven’t come for anything untoward, Molly. I just want to talk.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Then you’d better come through to the kitchen. We can’t use the parlour, not just the two of us.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly edged carefully round Jack and led him through the door at the end of the hall into the kitchen at the back of the house. The room was warm to the point of being stuffy, with a small fire in the grate adding its heat to that emanating from the cast-iron range that dominated the room. Two mismatched wooden chairs sat in front of the fireplace, one for each of the women in the household and Molly pointed to the largest one for Jack to sit on.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’ll be wanting tea, I expect.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘About time you offered. I’ve been here ages.’ He thought he caught a flash of anger in her eyes so he resolved to be more serious. ‘Thank you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly used a cloth to pull the large iron kettle on to the range and busied herself wiping clean two tin mugs she pulled from the narrow dresser in the corner. Jack watched her move around the kitchen, enjoying seeing her in such a domestic setting. It led his thoughts to what it would be like if they were to become man and wife, what it would be like to have Molly in his own kitchen, looking after him as only his wife would. He was surprised to find the notion did not sit badly in his mind.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’ll go blind if you keep staring.’ Molly delivered the warning with a smile.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At least you know your place, woman. Now, where’s my tea?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly stuck out her tongue. ‘I’ll throw it over you if you don’t take care, fancy fig of a uniform or not.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m glad you noticed my fine turnout.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I couldn’t miss it. I’ve never seen you looking so smart. Are you out to impress the ladies?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There’s only one lady I’m trying to impress but she’s a bit daft. She can’t see what’s right in front of her face.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly laughed and handed him his tea. ‘So what brings you to my door. Did you get lost?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stared at the dark liquid in his mug as if he could read his future in it. Molly saw his serious expression and had the sense to remain quiet as she took the seat next to him, reaching her hand out so that it rested lightly on his arm.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s Sloames.’ Jack spoke at last, his voice quiet.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sloames?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He’s managed to exchange his commission. He’ll be leaving the regiment.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I can go with him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Oh.’ Molly’s hand withdrew.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s what I’m here to tell you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly studied her hands for a long while before she spoke again. ‘What are you going to do?’ Her voice was small now, the question asked hesitantly as if she did not really want to know the answer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked deep into Molly’s eyes. ‘I don’t know.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You could stay with the regiment.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And go to the Indies? No thanks.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So you’ll go with Captain Sloames.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t know, Molly. Sloames wants me with him. He wants us to go on campaign.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course he does. He wants you there to clean his boots and wipe his backside.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He’s not so bad. He took time to tell me about the news. I’ve got to go with him to London for a few days so he can finish all the paperwork. It’ll give me a chance to think.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Bully for you.’ Some of Molly’s normal sharpness was returning.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I could always volunteer for another regiment.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What good would that do? You’d still be leaving and you could end up going to war all the same. Besides, you like being an orderly. You’re always telling me that it’s the first step to getting somewhere.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever amount to anything.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You won’t if you go around with that kind of attitude. You were born poor and you’ll die poor same as me if you don’t get a grip and shift yourself somewhere. You make your own future. It doesn’t get neatly delivered on a silver platter. You have to go and find it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They were both silent for a moment.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So what happens to me when you swan off with Sloames and go and fight your war?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You could wait for me. I’ll come back for you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And when would that be? A year? Two years? And all the while I sit here like a nun and work in the bloody laundry waiting for my hero to return.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was the first time Jack had heard Molly swear. ‘What would you have me do, Molly?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What is it to me what you do?’ Molly crossed her arms. ‘You’ll make your mind up with or without my two pennyworth.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So be it.’ Jack stood up quickly. ‘I’ll see myself out.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His heavy boots were loud on the wooden floor as he made to leave. But Molly would not let him go without having the final word.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s it. You bugger off as soon as the going gets hard. Well, you listen to me, Jack Lark. I’m not some little milksop who’ll sit on her backside waiting for some cove who may or may not come back some day. So you think hard on what you are going to do. Because I won’t wait forever, you hear me? I won’t damn well wait forever.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack closed the door, shutting off the angry tirade.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had to decide what he was going to do. He did not want to lose Molly, but nor did he want to pass up the chance to prove himself as a soldier. Somehow he had to square the circle.</p>
