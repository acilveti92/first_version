<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter008">EIGHT</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">I woke before dawn and lay on the narrow wooden bed watching the patterns of pale light gradually spread across the ceiling from the chink in the window drapes. I had slept fitfully, knotted up with anger at the way I had been treated by Underhill and his colleagues. During the many hours of wakefulness I had determined that it was fruitless for me to stay in Oxford, regardless of the inquest or the royal visitation; I would seek out my horse from the rector’s stables at first light and find my way to London by any means possible. I was conscious that I had found out little of use to Walsingham yet, and he would surely not appreciate the explanation that I had left in a fit of pique because I had been publicly humiliated, but I was so clearly unwelcome here that it seemed unlikely I could ever carry out his plan of gaining the Fellows’ confidence and thereby learning anything useful.</p>
<p class="indented">I sighed and turned on my side, wrapping myself tightly in the sheet against the draught, and allowed my thoughts to drift back to Sophia. I had lain awake the previous night, my thoughts full of her. She was a compelling enough reason to stay in Oxford and an equally compelling one to leave. I realised that it had been some time since I had been as close to a woman as I had come the evening before when she had almost fainted into my arms, and the jolt of longing that shook me at that moment had left me profoundly disconcerted. I wondered if she had felt it too; there were moments while we talked when her frank gaze had locked with mine and it seemed she wanted me to read something there, but I knew that as a guest of her father’s I must take great care how I approached her. Besides, I reminded myself, had she not spoken with a kind of pitying regret of the way her father had spent his life dependent on the patronage of great men, and was I not in the same position? I had no means to marry, no money or property of my own, nothing to offer a young gentlewoman except my affection, and I knew from experience that a father places little value on such things in his daughter’s suitors. So I could not court her respectably, and although that fleeting touch the night before had powerfully awoken my desire, I already knew that I liked her too much to think of a casual seduction. I wanted urgently to see her again, yet had no idea what I hoped might happen between us. My mind kept running back to the expression on her face when I showed her the Copernican diagram; the fleeting light of recognition in her eyes at the symbol of the wheel. What did Sophia know, and how could I persuade her to confide in me?</p>
<p class="indented">The chorus of birdsong became more insistent. I pulled back the sheet and crossed the room to draw the drapes and look out over the courtyard of Lincoln as the pink early light streaked across the sky in gaps between jagged clouds. The rain had given Oxford a temporary reprieve, though there was no guarantee the road to London would be passable after the weather of the past two days. The flagstones of the quadrangle gleamed under the night’s rain, puddles reflecting slashes of pale rosy sky. I could not make out the hands of the clock from my window, but thought I may as well dress anyway; as soon as the college was up and stirring I could ask Cobbett how I might go about recovering my horse. I wondered if I should say a formal goodbye to the rector, claiming I had pressing business to return to, but then I might learn that I had a legal obligation to stay and testify at the inquest; better to leave first and plead ignorance later, I thought, and I did not want to give Underhill the satisfaction of seeing that he had driven me away. Perhaps I could leave a message for Sidney on my way out of the city.</p>
<p class="indented">I was about to turn away from the window when a sudden movement in the courtyard caught my eye; a figure wearing a black cloak with the hood pulled up scurried from the south-west corner of the quadrangle and disappeared into the tower archway. Immediately I felt my muscles tense; I had not been able to make out who it was, but if I was quick to follow I might see who could be dashing about so furtively at such an hour. I grabbed for my shirt, and then paused, berating myself. Had I not already decided that whatever undercover comings and goings went on in this place were not my business? I would leave today, and if there was a murderer in the college they would just have to deal with it themselves; my attempts at finding the truth had been met with contempt and threats, and I wanted nothing more to do with any of it.</p>
<p class="indented">As I pulled on my shirt and breeches, a single bell began the doleful call to Matins and I recalled with a sinking heart that it was Sunday. The servants would probably have a day off; I would be unlikely to find anyone able to help me locate the horse and, in any case, I would have to return it to the stables at Windsor and how I might make my way back from there to London alone on a Sunday, I had no idea. In the unsparing daylight, my planned flight began to look as ill judged as it was cowardly.</p>
<p class="indented">I poured some water from the pitcher left on the small table and washed my face slowly; if I had to stay for one more day, I could at least try to put it to some profitable use and I would start by attending chapel. I had no wish to hear the English service for its own sake – while I found no spiritual nourishment in the Roman Mass, at least it put some effort into its theatrics, and I found the English prayer book as bland as uncooked dough beside it – but it would be a useful opportunity to observe the whole college community gathered in one place. If one of them had sent me the strange message last night, as seemed likely, it was possible that he might give himself away by looks or gestures. I thought of him now, as I splashed my face, with irritation; if he had any useful information to impart, why not make himself clearer?</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">James Coverdale had mentioned at the first night’s dinner that the rector was preaching a series of sermons based on Foxe’s book; if Roger Mercer’s killing was some twisted parody of martyrdom, as someone clearly wanted me to believe, it was possible that the killer had taken inspiration from the rector’s sermons. It was even possible that he would be among the congregation that morning. I shivered, pulled on my boots and, as the bell continued its solemn clang, I hurried to join the black-gowned figures heading for the central archway of the north range, under the clock, which showed the hour to be almost six.</p>
<p class="flush-left">The chapel occupied the larger portion of the first floor of the north range, to the right of the archway, and I filed dutifully up the dim stairs among the students and Fellows, the only light offered by a candle lantern suspended from the landing above. By the door I noticed a holy water stoup, long dry, as we passed into a modest, lime-washed room with a wooden-beamed roof, the floor strewn with rushes. A small altar stood at the furthest end, opposite the door, with a lectern to the right of it; candles burned on each side of the chapel and on the altar, and the men arranged themselves along the rows of hard oak benches apparently designed for maximum discomfort, to prevent anyone from drowsing during sermons. Narrow arched windows of plain glass on both sides of the small chapel filled it with early morning light that gleamed from the white walls and on the long dark hair of Sophia Underhill, who was seated on the front pew by the lectern, where she would be under her father’s watchful eye. I wondered that he allowed her to attend chapel with the scholars; her presence seemed guaranteed to distract young men from pious prayer. Then I noticed that her mother was seated beside her, her thin shoulders hunched beneath the white coif which bound her hair. Around her the senior Fellows were ranked along the front benches, with the older students – those proceeding to masters or doctors degrees – seated in the rows behind them, and the undergraduates at the back. As I hovered by the door, wondering where I should properly take my place, I had a chance to see just how small the college community was. There could not have been more than thirty men, including the senior Fellows; with lives spent in such close proximity, surely one among them had some knowledge of what had really taken place in the Grove the previous morning. Taking in the room in a swift glance, I spotted Thomas Allen and Lawrence Weston among the undergraduates, though there was no sign of Norris or the loud commoner friends he had brought to the tavern; I presumed that Matins was yet another college rule they were able to buy their way out of. William Bernard and Richard Godwyn, the librarian, sat on the front bench, and I noticed John Florio in the middle, whispering animatedly to his neighbour. These were the only men I had met personally in the college, yet there was every possibility that my mysterious correspondent was someone who had yet to introduce himself.</p>
<p class="indented">But he must have been a member of the college, to have known where to find my chamber. I turned to glance again at the young men seated behind me and those in my line of sight returned my stare with mild curiosity; these English boys all looked the same – pale, underfed and anxious. One among them knew something he wanted to impart to me and was afraid to say outright – but which one?</p>
<p class="indented">I had intended to find a seat that would give me a vantage point over all those gathered, but Godwyn, seeing me hesitating at the door, smiled and gestured to a place next to him on the front bench. I could hardly refuse; conscious of all the eyes on me, including Sophia’s, I walked down the short central aisle and sat down beside Godwyn, who welcomed me in a whisper as we bent our heads to pray. I could not help noticing that both Walter Slythurst and James Coverdale were absent. When the men were all seated, they rose again as one, as the rector processed the short distance from the door to the altar followed by four young men in the white surplices of choirboys.</p>
<p class="indented">Looking up, I caught the rector’s eye; if he was surprised to see me among his congregants or repented of his hard words the night before, his face gave no sign of it. Instead he merely bowed his head and intoned the Our Father.</p>
<p class="indented">‘O Lord, open Thou my lips,’ he began, and the congregation dutifully responded,</p>
<p class="indented">‘And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.’</p>
<p class="indented">I was not familiar enough with the order of the responses to follow them fluently, and kept my voice to a whisper to avoid drawing unwelcome attention to my mistakes. Godwyn rose to read the first lesson from the Gospel of Matthew, and after he was seated again, the small choir sang a four-voice version of the <em class="calibre2">Te Deum Laudamus</em> in English, which was remarkably sweet for all its plainness.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yesterday, gentlemen,’ the rector went on, staring resolutely over the heads of his congregation, apparently excluding his wife and daughter from his address, ‘sudden violent death intruded most horribly into our little community. I know that the tragic attack on our dear friend Roger Mercer as he walked at prayer in the Grove has shaken all of us to the core, and I know too that when such a dreadful accident occurs, we can all too easily allow our brains to grow heated with the shock and indulge in all manner of wild speculation.’ Here he flashed a pointed glance at me, so quickly as to go almost unnoticed. Doctor Bernard cracked his bony knuckles together; the snap was startling in the still room.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It would be more profitable,’ the rector continued over-loudly, as if he were speaking to a much larger gathering, ‘if, instead of unhelpful rumour, we allowed some good to come from this tragedy by concentrating our minds on the brevity of our lives in contrast to the vastness of eternity, and looked to our own standing before God. Let us mourn Roger, as is right and proper, but let us also learn from his death and ask ourselves, would we face death assured of our own salvation, if it should come upon us as suddenly?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It almost sounds as if he expects another tragedy,’ I whispered to Godwyn; Underhill glanced up and frowned angrily from behind his lectern, though he could not have heard my words.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let us return, then, as we have in recent weeks, to Master Foxe’s account of the persecutions of the early believers, our forefathers in faith in the days when the Church was pure. Not so that we may pay them idolatrous reverence as saints, as the Roman Church does, for they were only men and women like us, but so that we might emulate their faith and better understand the long and venerable history of suffering for Christ and of standing firm, as those martyrs of Reform have done in this troubled century of ours. Let us ask ourselves, as we consider today the story of Alban, the first English martyr, if we truly believe that the preservation of the faith is the highest good. For these are turbulent days, my friends,’ he continued, his voice rising slightly as he leaned over the lectern to fix his listeners with a stern eye. ‘Our English Church is besieged on all sides by those who would drag us back to Rome. You young men sitting before me today are the future leaders of Church and State, and you do not know how you may be called upon to fight for both in the years to come. Will you be resolute, even in the face of death? Will you defend our liberties from the idolaters and tyrants who would tear them from us? I pray it may be so.’</p>
<p class="indented">From the benches behind me, a collective movement could be heard; the sound of several rows of young men drawing themselves up proudly in response to this rallying cry. I found something disturbing in Underhill’s tone; there was a barely suppressed fanaticism to it, but his words reminded me of Walsingham’s.</p>
<p class="indented">The rector’s homily was more of a lecture than a sermon, though it was a relief to find that his talent for expounding on a text was greater than his talent for debating ideas. But as he spoke, I became so lost in my own speculation that I barely noticed when he pronounced the final collect, and was only dislodged from my reverie by Godwyn nudging me apologetically as the men around me all stood. The rector and his choir filed out and the congregation shuffled and stretched as they made ready to leave. One young man with violently red hair and a face peppered with freckles, who looked barely old enough to be away from his mother, busied himself at the front of the chapel, tidying away the accoutrements of the service, closing the large bible on the lectern and snuffing out the candles around us. As she drew towards me, Sophia smiled and seemed about to speak, but her mother, noticing the look that passed between us, pinned her daughter firmly by the elbow and led her towards the door. Sophia glanced once over her shoulder and there seemed to be something imploring in her expression, but I might have imagined that.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am sorry to have poked you so unceremoniously, Doctor Bruno,’ Godwyn whispered, as the red-haired young man clearing the chapel approached us and handed Godwyn the last remaining flickering candle, ‘but I feared you were having some trouble following our Book of Common Prayer – the manner of our service must seem very strange to you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not so strange,’ I replied, watching as Sophia passed out of sight before turning back to him with a smile, ‘you have borrowed a great deal of it from us, after all.’</p>
<p class="indented">He gave a small, polite laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But tell me, did you not think our little choir sings well?’ he asked brightly as we walked towards the door, making a shield of his hand to protect the candle as the draught from the stairs assaulted it.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have heard choirs twice their number make a poorer job of the psalms,’ I said truthfully.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The arrangement is by Master Byrd, Her Majesty’s own composer,’ he said, looking pleased at the praise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘A Catholic himself, is he not?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn looked aghast.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well – yes, he is, but that is not why I admire him,’ he said quickly. ‘If the queen can tolerate his faith for the sake of his music, I do not see why we should not do the same.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Quite. And of course, your own reading of the gospel was given with true poetic expression,’ I added, in a devout tone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you. That duty should fall to the sub-rector, but Doctor Coverdale did not arrive for Matins this morning, so the rector asked me to step in at the last moment.’</p>
<p class="indented">Instead of following the crowd of undergraduates down the stairs, he crossed the landing to a low wooden door opposite the chapel’s entrance, one hand still cupped around his candle, and gestured to me to follow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I remember you expressed an interest in our library, Doctor Bruno – would you like to take a look, now you are here? Unless you are impatient to break your fast, of course,’ he added. ‘Perhaps you would not mind holding this for a moment?’</p>
<p class="indented">He handed me the candle and took a ring of keys from his belt, selecting the largest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I should be delighted,’ I said, following him, though I was more interested by his news about Coverdale. ‘Is Doctor Coverdale away, then?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, if he is, he gave no one any warning,’ Godwyn said, sounding piqued as he turned the key stiffly in the lock and pushed open the heavy door, which groaned as if in complaint at being disturbed.</p>
<p class="indented">I remembered the boy who had come to summon Coverdale in the middle of the disputation the previous evening, and Cobbett’s report that Coverdale had returned to college as if in an almighty haste. It was curious, then, that Cobbett had not mentioned his leaving again – unless he had somehow slipped away in the night, or early in the morning. I wondered if his disappearance could have anything to do with the inquest into Roger Mercer’s death and his threats to me over my testimony.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Strange. I noticed the bursar, Master Slythurst, was also absent,’ I added lightly.</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn made a dismissive gesture as he closed the door behind me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Slythurst is often away, it’s part of his duties – he has to check the college’s estates regularly, and they are scattered about the country, some several days’ ride. I believe he left for Buckinghamshire this morning as he has some business there, but we expect him back tomorrow. Now then – here we are.’ He spread his arms expansively to encompass his domain, and smiled encouragement, as if urging me to admire it as much as he did.</p>
<p class="indented">The library took up the first floor of the north range on the west side of the central staircase, directly opposite the chapel but slightly smaller in proportion. Like the chapel, it had a rush-covered floor and wooden beams in the roof, and was laid out in the style of the last century, with long wooden lecterns at which readers would stand to study the large manuscript books secured by brass chains to a brass rod running beneath the desks. There were four of these lecterns on each side of the chapel, secured to the wall between the arched windows. At each end of the room, wooden benches stood against the wall and at the far end, a small writing desk was placed under the last window overlooking the courtyard; Godwyn strode towards it and carefully placed his keys beside an inkwell before turning to me to retrieve his candle.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Which books are of particular interest to you, Doctor Bruno, or shall I just begin by showing you our most valuable manuscripts?’ he asked over his shoulder, as he made his way methodically down the length of the room, lighting candles in the holders at the end of each lectern and in the wall niches between the windows.</p>
<p class="indented">‘This is not your whole collection, surely?’ I asked, gesturing to the books that lay chained to the reading desks.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, goodness, no – these are only the older books that must be chained up, I regret to say, for fear of theft, and the ones the students use most frequently. They are largely works of scholastic theology and are extremely valuable, many of them part of our original benefactor’s gift.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Dean Flemyng, from his travels in Italy,’ I said thoughtfully, nodding. ‘And where do you keep the prohibited books?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn blanched and stared at me, a puzzled frown creasing his high forehead. He looked almost frightened.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But we keep no prohibited books here, Doctor Bruno. What can you mean?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come now, Master Godwyn,’ I said, holding out my palms to show I meant no offence. ‘Every university library I have known keeps some books away from the inquisitive eyes of the students. Books that only the senior members are judged able to understand?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn’s relief was visible.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh! Yes, of course – we have a number of books available only to the junior and senior Fellows, which they may borrow and take away to read in their own rooms. We keep them in the chests in this room here.’ He crossed to a door in the wall behind his desk and opened it, revealing a small chamber annexed to the library. Though it was shadowy inside, by the faint light of his candle I could make out several large trunks lining the walls. ‘I thought for a moment you referred to heretical books,’ he added, with a self-conscious laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, no – I understood those had been rooted out by the queen’s commissioners some time ago.’</p>
<p class="indented">He nodded, a little sadly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There was a great purge of the university libraries in ’69. Anything that had survived the previous purges under Her Majesty’s father, and then her brother and sister, was taken away. Books that, between you and me, Doctor Bruno, were no more heretical than any other, but there was great suspicion cast over the university after the Catholic resurgence in Bloody Mary’s time and the colleges must all be seen to expel anything with so much as a taint of unorthodoxy. The collection here was badly depleted, I’m sorry to say.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The notion of heresy changes with reliable frequency according to who happens to be in charge,’ I agreed. ‘But what happened to the books that were deemed dangerous?’</p>
<p class="indented">He looked at me blankly, as if he had not considered the question before.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I presume they were burned, though if they were, it was not publicly. I doubt they could have been sold openly once they were on the forbidden list. I was an undergraduate then, so I was only dimly aware of the commission – too busy sweating over my Greek and trying not to think about girls – but I would have remembered if there had been a book-burning.’ He smiled fondly at the image of his younger self. ‘You would need to ask William Bernard – he was librarian at the time.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Really?’ This was indeed valuable news, and I thought it curious that Bernard had not mentioned it during our discussion about books at the rector’s table on my first night. My blood quickened; could that irascible old man have squirrelled away somewhere a cache of books judged too dangerous for the minds of young men destined to shape the future of England? And was there the ghost of a chance that among his acquisitions from a certain Florentine bookseller more than a hundred years earlier, Dean Flemyng might have picked up a manuscript whose value he did not recognise, but whose existence William Bernard had seemed unusually eager to deny?</p>
<p class="indented">I breathed deeply, trying not to betray my agitation. It was almost certainly too much to hope that the manuscript I sought was here, but it was not beyond the bounds of possibility. If anyone knew whether an uncatalogued Greek book had been part of the Dean’s original bequest, it would be William Bernard, who had been in the college longer than anyone, who read Greek and would know exactly what he had in his hands, should he have unearthed it. The challenge would be persuading him to confide in a stranger; the old man was wily as a stoat and already suspicious of me for my apparent disobedience to all religions.</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn had finished lighting his candles and turned to me, clasping his hands like an anxious host.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps you would like to see our copy of Cicero’s <em class="calibre2">De Officiis</em>, which Dean Flemyng copied in his own hand?’ he ventured, gesturing to one of the lecterns at the far end. ‘I light the candles because, although it is Sunday, many of the scholars like to spend it here in quiet study. The undergraduates may not take books to their rooms, you see.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you, by any chance, keep a copy of Master Foxe’s book among your loan collection?’ I asked as I followed, in as off-hand a manner as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The <em class="calibre2">Actes and Monuments</em>?’ He looked surprised. ‘Yes, I have the 1570 edition, the second printing, though it may be out with someone at the moment – did you want to see it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘May I? I was interested in reading further after the rector’s sermon this morning.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are welcome to read it,’ he said, doubtfully, ‘though I’m afraid you will not find Foxe very generous to those of your faith. But I must ask you to look at it here in the library – only the Fellows are permitted to sign the books out, you see. That way we have some surety if they come back the worse for wear.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The books, or the Fellows?’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn laughed politely, and led the way to one of the large wooden trunks in the small back room. As he crouched to lift out a pile of books, I noticed a smaller chest, tucked away into the corner and fastened with a padlock. Godwyn stacked the volumes carefully on the floor, then reached again into the chest and handed me a fat volume, plainly bound in cloth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have seen a copy in the library in Paris,’ I said, turning the book over in my hands, ‘but I have not read it in detail. The rector’s sermon whetted my appetite. And the story of Ignatius – that too is among the tales of the early martyrs?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, indeed – the ten primitive persecutions under the Romans,’ he said, tilting his head slightly as if he found my question strange. ‘All in Book One.’</p>
<p class="indented">Just then, the door opened and all the candles wavered along the lecterns as the red-haired young man who had been tidying the chapel earlier leaned in and coughed nervously.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Master Godwyn, sir? Rector Underhill wants to speak with you about a private matter, if you have a moment.’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn looked anxiously at me, then back to the boy.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You would not mind if I step out for a minute, Doctor Bruno? I am sure I may trust you not to steal the books.’ He laughed nervously.</p>
<p class="indented">I waved a hand, eager to examine the Foxe.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your books will be safe with me, Master Godwyn.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Might I ask you to wait until I return, then? The library must not be left open and unattended, you see.’ He looked apprehensive. I assured him that I would guard the place with my life and he followed the red-haired boy out with an anxious backwards glance, closing the door softly behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">I settled myself at Godwyn’s large desk and opened the volume of Foxe at Book One, but as I did so, I realised that the librarian had left his bunch of keys behind. A thought struck me; glancing briefly at the door, I grabbed the keys and found among them a small iron key of the size to open a padlock. In the back room, I knelt by the locked chest and fitted it to the lock; to my surprise, it sprung open smoothly to reveal a pile of black cloth. As I lifted this out, I saw that it was an academic gown, placed there to conceal the books beneath. I picked up the topmost volume; it was bound in aged calfskin and felt fragile to the touch, its corners frayed, but it was the title page that caused me to draw a sharp breath and check instinctively once more to make sure I was alone.</p>
<p class="indented">It was a copy of the executed Jesuit Edmund Campion’s <em class="calibre2">Ten Reasons</em>, and the printer’s mark showed it had come from Rheims. There was no doubt that this book, Campion’s staunch defence of the Catholic faith, was prohibited in England, and certainly in Oxford; beneath it I found other texts and pamphlets equally distasteful to the English authorities, by Robert Persons, William Allen and other Catholic writers out of Europe. I leafed through them for a moment, my pulse quickening, until I was startled by a creaking timber from the library behind me and remembered that Godwyn would soon be returning. I searched quickly to the bottom of the chest but there were no books in Greek; these were forbidden books of a different sort. Replacing them quickly and recovering them with the gown, I locked the chest in haste and returned the keys, then seated myself quickly at Godwyn’s desk in case he should return.</p>
<p class="indented">I concentrated my attention on the Foxe, flicking hastily through the pages in search of the story of Ignatius. The task was not difficult; there, on page forty-six, I found what I had anticipated – a gap in the paper the length of two lines of print, cut so neatly as to leave the surrounding text intact. Only the text that had been pushed under my door was missing, the incision as precise as only a bookbinder’s knife or similar instrument could make. Or a pen knife, I thought suddenly, catching sight of Godwyn’s quill and inkwell on the desk in front of me. But that could hardly narrow the search; every scholar in the college must own one of those.</p>
<p class="indented">The latch clicked and Godwyn reappeared, pulling the door shut behind him and shaking his head to himself.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am sorry to abandon you, Doctor Bruno – Rector Underhill wanted to discuss which of poor Roger Mercer’s books should be given to the library’s collection. Did you find what you wanted?’ he asked pleasantly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I fear the rats have been at your books, Master Godwyn,’ I replied, beckoning him closer and turning to the ravaged page forty-six, which I held open in front of him. He looked from me to the book with incomprehension for a moment, before a flush of outrage spread over his sagging features.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But whoever would do such a thing?’ he exclaimed, then glanced over his shoulder as if someone might have overheard. ‘How did you know …?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I found the missing lines pushed under my door last night.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But – <em class="calibre2">why</em>?’ Godwyn continued to stare at me as if he feared my wits had fled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Look at the passage,’ I whispered.</p>
<p class="indented">He raised the book closer to his face and skimmed the page. When he looked up at me again his expression was one of severe shock.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ignatius,’ he whispered. ‘I am the wheat of Christ – I forget the exact words, but that is the missing part, is it not? Something about the teeth of wild beasts.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded. He looked at the book again and exhaled carefully, as if trying to control his response.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah. You think this is a reference to Roger’s death?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think that is what whoever sent me those lines wishes me to conclude, yes.’</p>
<p class="indented">He closed the book and frowned, so that the lines in his brow formed deep runnels.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why you, Doctor Bruno, if that does not seem rude?’</p>
<p class="indented">I hesitated again, unsure again how much to reveal.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was among the first to arrive in the Grove yesterday morning after Doctor Mercer was attacked by the dog.’ I dropped my voice even further until it was barely audible. ‘On the evidence of what I saw, I suggested that his death may not have been an accident.’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn’s eyes widened until his eyebrows threatened to disappear.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But – they said the gate was unlocked – the wild dog strayed in—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘My hypothesis was not widely taken up by your colleagues. But it seems that someone else wants to strengthen my conviction that his death was by design.’ I gestured to the book in his hands. Godwyn scrutinised its cover with as much disbelief as if it had spoken aloud, then turned his keen eyes back to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You think someone is trying to imply that Roger was <em class="calibre2">martyred</em>?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Someone certainly wants me to notice a similarity in the manner of his death, but why should Doctor Mercer be considered a martyr?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn looked at me in silence for a long while as my whispered question hung in the air.</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head sharply. ‘I cannot think.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who would have access to the books in that back room?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, all the Fellows have a key to the library, but they are not supposed to take any books on loan without first checking with me and signing the ledger. The students may only use the library when I am present to keep an eye on them, but – well, I am not always as scrupulous as I might be in that regard.’ He looked guilty for a moment. ‘If I need to pop out and there are a few students here deep in their work, it seems harsh to lock them out if only for a short while. It’s not as if they can easily steal a book, and I would trust them to take care of the library.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, it seems your trust in someone was misplaced,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn’s face clouded, as if he was only now registering the gravity of the assault on library property.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But I was here in the library until about quarter to five yesterday afternoon, when I locked up and left for the disputation, along with the students who were here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you did not leave the library unattended before a quarter to five?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Anyone would think you were a magistrate, Doctor Bruno, with all these questions,’ he said, forcing a smile, but his eyes were guarded. ‘I may have had to go and use the privy during that time, I really can’t remember, but I’m sure I would not have been gone long enough for anyone to achieve <em class="calibre2">this</em>.’ He banged the cover of the Foxe with his palm. ‘It has been very carefully done, I do not think it was a rushed job by someone looking over his shoulder all the while.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No,’ I agreed. ‘And no one could have come in while you were out at the disputation?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, as I say, the Fellows all have keys, but they were out at the disputation too,’ he said, though his eyes swerved away from mine as he said it.</p>
<p class="indented">All except James Coverdale, I thought, but I had already dismissed him as the person most eager to persuade me away from the theory of murder.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No one else at all has a key?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Only the rector. Oh – and, of course …’ Here he hesitated and his demeanour became awkward.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who?’ I pressed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Mistress Sophia has the use of her father’s key sometimes,’ he said, cupping a fist against his mouth as if he were about to cough. ‘She has a fancy that she can be as good a scholar as any and he indulges her in it. I suspect it comes of the loss of his son – though, of course, that is his business.’ He shook his head. ‘Mind you, I would not allow any daughter of mine such freedom, if I had one, for women’s minds are not made for learning and I confess I fear for her health – but I must be thankful that he only permits her to visit at times when the scholars are unlikely to be present. Otherwise she has them all panting after her like dogs in season, Doctor Bruno, and I don’t want my library used for that sort of thing – at least with her own key, she can come in when the young men are out at public lectures.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does she use the library when you are not here to supervise?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I expect so,’ Godwyn said, as if the matter were out of his hands. ‘If she has her father’s permission I can hardly gainsay him – besides, she is not going to steal the books, is she?’</p>
<p class="indented">No, I thought, but might she have used her key to gain access last night, knowing the whole college would be at the Divinity School for over an hour? She had not betrayed a flicker of recognition when I mentioned the quotation, but that was not in itself proof of ignorance. But why on earth would Sophia write to me anonymously and then feign ignorance when she had a chance to discuss the matter with me alone? The person who had written to me was clearly anxious not to be identified as the source of the information, scant as it was – could it be that Sophia knew something about someone in the college, but could not be seen overtly to denounce him? Could that someone be her own father?</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Master Godwyn,’ I said, rising from his chair to take my leave.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, but I have not yet shown you our illustrated manuscript of St Cyprian’s letters which Dean Flemyng also brought out of Florence,’ he began, his eyes clouding with disappointment. I studied his face as I apologised for leaving, reflecting that those large, melancholy eyes lent his face an air of disarming frankness. But I now knew that Godwyn was also a man hiding his own secrets, and I reminded myself that I must not trust the face that any of them presented to me or to the world. As William Bernard had so pointedly told me that first night, no man in Oxford was what he seemed.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter007" class="calibre4">SEVEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Gaston seemed more effusive than usual when I arrived at the Swan shortly after midday.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Jesus, boy, what’s happened to your face?’</p>
<p class="indented">I touched a finger to my swollen lip. I had not seen myself in a mirror yet. ‘I was involved in an altercation.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That right?’ He seemed impressed. ‘One of your philosophical debates, was it?’</p>
<p class="indented">I grinned, and winced at the pain. ‘My opponent put forward a robust defence of Aristotle.’</p>
<p class="indented">He clapped me hard on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What can I get you, then? How about a dish of the beef, now that we have a clean slate, so to speak?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Clean slate?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know how you do it, Bruno. You could charm your way out of Purgatory, I always say. Not that it was a problem—’ he held up a hand – ‘you know I’ve never chased you for it, but I take my hat off to you all the same, I really do, you’ve the luck of the Devil.’ He shook his head, indulgent. ‘Will I bring you some wine with it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gaston – what are you talking about?’ I never ordered beef at the Swan; he knew my purse did not stretch that far.</p>
<p class="indented">Now it was his turn to look puzzled. ‘Your debt, my friend. Feller come in this morning and paid off the lot. Said he owed you a favour.’ He looked stricken. ‘Maybe I wasn’t meant to tell you.’</p>
<p class="indented">I sighed. ‘An Englishman?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s right.’ He brightened. ‘Friend from London, he said. Very generous of him, I thought. I mean, I don’t want to remind you how much it’d crept up to, but—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then don’t.’ I preferred not to think about actual figures. I had no doubt that my benefactor would make clear the extent of my debt in due course. ‘He is generous, no question.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, don’t look too happy about it. Some of us’d be glad to have a friend like that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Make it the beef, then. But leave the wine.’ All I could think of was the old adage that with friends like Charles Paget, one has no need of enemies.</p>
<p class="indented">While Gaston disappeared to bellow my order through to the kitchen, I closed my eyes and mulled over the letter from Walsingham that had just taken me the best part of an hour to transcribe, before committing it to memory and burning it.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">My skill at deciphering had grown rusty and the cipher Walsingham had given me before I left England was devilishly complex, disguised as four unique alphabets of letters, numbers and symbols and hidden in separate books so that no one, happening upon only one of the papers, would hold the complete cipher in his hand. The exact combination of the four keys to unlock any text was not set down anywhere in writing, but existed only in my memory. But with patience, Walsingham’s brisk, direct voice had emerged from the impenetrable jumble of signs on the page. He must have been confident that the cipher was beyond Stafford’s capabilities, since much of the letter concerned the ambassador and his new protégé:</p>
<p class="letter-space-after"><em class="calibre6">It has come to my attention that Charles Paget has once again offered his services to England in the hope of buying a pardon for his past treasons – an offer he has made to me several times and which I have repeatedly refused</em>.<em class="calibre6"> But I fear Stafford is taken in by him, for he has a most plausible manner and was born to double-dealing. Be assured – Charles Paget is a most dangerous instrument, and I wish for England’s sake he had never been born. While Stafford congratulates himself, you may be sure that Paget is steering their alliance to his own advantage. Do not be fooled. Paget takes money from many hands, but he serves only himself.</em></p>
<p class="indented">Stafford believed he was engaging my services, at Walsingham’s instruction, to bring him intelligence from the royal court as to where the King intended to make alliances, either with the Huguenots or the Catholic League. But that was only half the story. The old spymaster’s real intention, he explained, was to give me a reason to visit the embassy on a regular basis so that I could keep an eye on Stafford, and particularly his dealings with Paget. All secret correspondence concerning them was to be sent via a trusted messenger, an agent of Walsingham’s in Paris who would make himself known to me in due course, and would place my letters directly into Walsingham’s hands, so that Stafford would not suspect I was watching him.</p>
<p class="indented">Fresh reports from Rome said that Pope Sixtus had issued a new bull, the lead still soft on its seal, confirming and reinforcing the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth and denouncing her as a bastard, a heretic and a schismatic – justification enough for a patriotic Catholic to feel he was doing a service to God and England by dispatching her. This bull, Walsingham feared, might be the spark that lit the fuse under the powder keg. Mary Stuart’s supporters in Paris had recovered from their defeat two years ago and he had reason to believe that another substantial plot was brewing, making Paget’s overtures to Stafford all the more suspicious for, as Walsingham said, no conspiracy worth the name would unfold in Paris without Paget at the heart of it. Meanwhile it appeared that Paget had also been watching me, for reasons as yet known only to him, but which were unlikely to be to my advantage.</p>
<p class="indented">I let my head drop into my hands as a wave of giddiness washed over me, blurring the edges of my vision; the bench seemed to tilt beneath my weight, as if the reed-strewn floor of the Swan were the deck of a ship. I blinked hard and pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes until the sensation passed. Perhaps the blow to the head had affected me more than I realised. I had wanted this, I reminded myself: to be taken back into Walsingham’s service. The strain of leading a double life was the price of admission.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">I jerked my head up and focused on the eyes of a young man across the table, peering into my face as if he feared I might need a physician. I took in his appearance, tensing at the realisation that he wore the Augustinian habit. I had not seen Frère Joseph’s face last night, and this man appeared to know me. Slowly, I slipped one hand under the table to feel for my knife. I saw from the flicker of his eyes that he had noticed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You look unwell,’ he observed, with an uncertain smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Just a few scratches,’ I said, hoping the waves of dizziness would hold off if I had to fight.</p>
<p class="indented">He looked at my face, then shrugged. ‘Frère Guillaume sent me, though he wasn’t certain you’d be here, after last night. He said you had something to return to him. He was unable to come himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">I peered more closely, squinting to focus my blurred vision on him, and realised why he seemed familiar; he was the one who had first come to find me in the library when Paul had asked for me at Saint-Victor. I let my shoulders relax, and unhooked Cotin’s keys from my belt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is Frère Guillaume all right?’</p>
<p class="indented">The young friar looked pensive. ‘He’s been confined to his cell for a few days while the Abbé considers how to discipline him. He asked me to tell you not to worry about him, and that Denis was safe and well, if you needed him. He said you would know what that meant.’ He hesitated, his eyes expectant. When I only nodded, he continued: ‘He also said you’d be interested to hear about Frère Joseph.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What about him?’ I kept my face neutral.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He’s missing. No one has seen him since last night. The Abbé is worried. He has people out scouring the city for him, the brothers are saying.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Really? What else are they saying?’</p>
<p class="indented">He lowered his voice. ‘The talk is that it has something to do with you.’ He hunched forward with an air of complicity. ‘Some of the brothers said you were arrested last night stealing money from his cell.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘There was a misunderstanding. As you see, I am not in custody.’ I held up my wrists to prove the point. The young friar looked dubiously at the bandages and back to the cut on my lip.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Were you spying on him?’ He seemed intrigued by the idea. ‘The rumour in the abbey is that Joseph is the Abbé’s go-between. That he carries secret letters.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘To whom?’</p>
<p class="indented">He shrugged. ‘No one knows. It is all speculation. Some say the Duke of Guise, some say the Queen Mother, others say Navarre.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, that covers most possibilities. So the Abbé is concerned that Joseph might have disappeared with letters in his possession?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I suppose. Where do you think he is?’</p>
<p class="indented">I eyed him, weighing up how much to say. This boy could not be much more than twenty, and he had the same harried air that had struck me when he came to summon me to the infirmary. Perhaps that was his habitual manner. I noticed his fingernails were bitten down raw to the quick. Cotin evidently trusted the boy enough to send him; still, I needed to be careful.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No idea. What are the guesses at Saint-Victor?’</p>
<p class="indented">He considered. ‘Joseph comes from a noble family – he is related to the Duke of Montpensier. I suppose the Abbé is trying all those connections. Also—’ he glanced up to make sure he had my attention, and a faint colour stained his cheeks – ‘there were rumours he had a mistress.’</p>
<p class="indented">I sat up at this. ‘What, a courtesan?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No one knew for certain. Some said a married noblewoman.’ He lowered his eyes, abashed. ‘I don’t know if there is truth in it. But friars like to run with that kind of gossip.’</p>
<p class="indented">I thought of the love letter I had found in Joseph’s mattress, with its suggestion of forbidden desires. Doubly illicit, if his lover were married, though abbey rumours were hardly a reliable source of information.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I know how friars love the smell of scandal. The way crows love carrion.’</p>
<p class="indented">He gave me a shy smile. ‘Frère Guillaume said you were once a friar too. Though you abandoned your order.’ I saw the shine of admiration in his eyes. ‘I envy you your liberty,’ he added, lowering his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You should not envy me anything, Frère …’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Benoît.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What may appear liberty to you—’ I broke off, seeing the way he twisted his features and turned his gaze to the window. I remembered all too well being his age, staring down the years into a lifetime of cloistered confinement, picturing your youth and vigour withering, unused; what right had I to tell him how to feel? ‘Is there anything else you can tell me about Frère Joseph?’ I asked, to change the subject.</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head and returned his attention to the table. ‘But if I hear anything, I can bring you word. We are not a closed order, as you know. I come into the city to study theology with one of the doctors at the Sorbonne. We could meet. I should like to talk further with you …’ He looked up with a hopeful expression; his boyish eagerness made me sit back, as if he had encroached too close. I hardly felt worthy to be anyone’s advisor at present.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would be glad if you could bring me any word of how it goes with Cotin,’ I said, a little formally. ‘Gaston here usually knows where to find me. Tell Cotin I hope he is soon restored to his liberty.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘Liberty,’ Benoît said, in a voice loaded with scorn. At that moment a serving girl arrived with a steaming plate of beef stew and a roll of fresh bread; the smell rising from it made my stomach lurch and I tore into the food with my fingers, barely raising my head to mumble farewell to Benoît as he took his leave.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">The bells were striking three as I finished my meal. I left some coins on the table for Gaston, guilt sitting uncomfortably heavy in my stomach along with the stew. I had been able to eat well today thanks to Paget, I had my freedom thanks to his purse, and I could not shake the feeling that I was already compromised by taking his money. Not that he had given me any choice in the matter, but I needed to extricate myself from that debt as soon as possible, before he demanded something in return, and my only hope of doing so was to find this Frère Joseph de Chartres and hand him over to the King. With Stafford’s information about Brinkley, it seemed most likely that a rendezvous was scheduled at the printer’s shop for four o’clock this afternoon, and there was a chance that Joseph might turn up, or that I might catch a glimpse of whoever he was intending to meet. It was worth a try, at least; I had no other paths to follow.</p>
<p class="indented">A sharp wind had whisked away the mist and cloud of the previous day, revealing a pale wintry sky. The surface of the river whipped into small peaks crested with foam on the mud-coloured water as I crossed the Pont Saint-Michel. I kept my cloak tight around me but my hood down, alert for any movement at the edge of sight. Paget’s criticism – that I did not look over my shoulder as often I should – had stung me, though it had also sounded like a subtle warning. I had believed myself to have developed some skill at this shadowy craft over the past three years, but he had made me feel like a boy playing at soldiers. Perhaps that was how he saw me. ‘Born to double-dealing’, Walsingham had said, and it was not just a figure of speech; I knew that Charles’s father, Lord Paget, had been spymaster for King Henry VIII of England. His sons had swallowed intrigue with their mother’s milk. It irritated me that Paget now occupied so much of my thinking, but I could not escape the sense that he was toying with me, and that I needed to raise my game if I were to spar with him as an equal.</p>
<p class="indented">As the round white towers of the Palais de Justice rose into view behind the houses of the bridge, I tried to order my unruly thoughts. My guess was that Frère Joseph authored the pamphlets against the King while Paul Lefèvre collected and delivered them to the printer. I had assumed in my ignorance that Paul had come to Saint-Victor on the day he was killed looking for me, but the propaganda leaflets offered a new interpretation; if he had a regular rendezvous with Joseph at the abbey, it would have been an easy business for the almoner to arrange to meet him outside the back gate as usual, attack him while he was off guard and push his body in the river. If Joseph had returned to the abbey by now, he would have learned that the draft pamphlets had been taken from his cell. There was no knowing whether he would take the risk of turning up at the printer’s to explain, but I had the papers tucked inside my doublet; if Joseph did not show his face, I could pretend he had sent me in his stead. It was a gamble, but I could learn much, if I could gain the printer’s trust.</p>
<p class="indented">The Palais looked elegant, if shabby, in the grey light; a maze of spires and towers in white stone, some three hundred years old, occupying the western-most tip of the island. Inside, the business of governing France was conducted at the highest level: the Parlement, the Chambre des Comptes, the Cour des Aides and the Cour des Monnaies. Outside, all around the buildings and courtyards, ramshackle shops and stalls filled every available space, reminding me of the yard around Saint Paul’s church in London. Some were no more than market barrows, with coloured canvas awnings snapping in the wind; others were substantial wooden workshops with painted shutters built against the stone walls of the Palais. Here you could find merchants and printers of all varieties; stationers; book-binders; food stalls selling sausage, bread, pies, roast chestnuts; letter-writers; poets and troubadours for hire; working women, parading self-consciously in their high wooden shoes, waiting for the clerks and officials to finish work; errand boys, beggars, pickpockets, skinny dogs and feral children, who would stare at you with wild, ravenous eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">Soldiers in royal colours guarded the doors into the Palais; others patrolled the courtyards in pairs, chatting, hands resting casually on sword hilts, eyes raking the crowds for any signs of trouble. The whole place buzzed with activity and purpose. Just as in London, people gathered in the aisle of Saint Paul’s to meet, gossip, barter, flirt and argue, so here in the Grande Salle, with its vast marble columns, the citizens of Paris congregated, overseen by the ranked statues of long-dead kings. It was hard to believe that somewhere beneath all this bustle and life and colour there could exist an oubliette as dark and silent as the one I had found myself in last night. I thought of the Count, slowly losing his mind down there in his own filth for thirteen years, for the crime of trying to protect his family, and my fists bunched at my sides. When this business with Frère Joseph was over and I was back in the King’s favour, I would petition him to do something about the poor wretch.</p>
<p class="indented">The English printer occupied the ground floor of a house in a row of buildings that stood along the boundary wall of the Palais. It appeared to be one of the better-kept premises; the front windows were glazed behind their wooden shutters and a painted sign swung outside. I peered in; my breath misted the glass, but I could make out a neat shop with rows of printed books displayed on shelves behind a counter where a man in his shirtsleeves bent over an open volume by the light of a candle. As church bells across the river struck the hour of four, I stepped back and ducked into the shadow of a wooden shed opposite, where I could remain half-obscured with a view of anyone approaching Brinkley’s shop.</p>
<p class="indented">I did not have long to wait. At about ten minutes past four, a figure in a dark cloak hurried past the windows and entered the printer’s, slipping around the door as fluidly as a cat. He had worn his hood pulled up; I had not seen his face but his furtive manner made clear that he did not want to advertise his presence there. I flexed my fingers and checked my knife as I crossed to Brinkley’s door, ignoring the voice in my head that questioned whether I was fit to fight two men at once. Perhaps I would do better to wait until the friar came out, but I was so close now to taking him, with evidence of his treasons; if I could catch him exchanging documents with the printer and bring him alive to the King, he would soon be persuaded to reveal his part in Paul’s murder and perhaps the wider conspiracy.</p>
<p class="indented">At the sound of the door, both men snapped their heads around immediately with faces as guilty as adulterers. The one in the cloak had drawn down his hood and was looking at me with a startled expression, fixed in the act of passing over a packet. I stared back at him; he was younger than I had expected, no more than mid-twenties, blond and rangy, with pale skin and sharp features dusted with freckles. He did not have the tonsure of a friar; more than that, there was no hint of recognition in his eyes. I had not seen Frère Joseph’s face last night and I was not sure how clearly he could have seen me, but I would have expected my appearance to excite some reaction, given that he knew people were looking for him. This boy seemed nervous, but not necessarily on my account.</p>
<p class="indented">‘May I help you, monsieur?’ The older man behind the counter addressed me in French with a blunt English accent as he took the packet from the boy and tucked it under the counter in one brisk movement. I assessed the room with a quick glance. The ground floor was divided in two by a partition wall; through the open doorway that connected the shop with the room behind I heard the rhythmic clanking of a printing press. The only way out was the main door; as long as I did not allow either of them to get behind me, I would have a clear escape. I smiled, attempting to recover an air of normality, though my presence was clearly unwelcome.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I beg your pardon, gentlemen,’ I said, in my best English, offering them a slight bow. ‘I did not mean to interrupt. Please – finish your business.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘We are finished, sir,’ the printer said, his voice hard. ‘And what is <em class="calibre6">your</em> business?’</p>
<p class="indented">I was tempted to observe that his manner of dealing with customers could do with a little refinement, but the boy was still staring fixedly at me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Forgive me,’ I said, addressing him, ‘but have we met? You seem familiar.’</p>
<p class="indented">He looked even more alarmed. ‘I do not believe so, sir.’ Despite his evident unease, his voice was firm and educated. It was also unmistakably English.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I beg your pardon, then. It must be that you remind me of someone.’ I inclined my head by way of apology and turned back to appraise the man with the rolled sleeves. Middling height, sandy hair receded so far that he had apparently decided to cut his losses and crop what remained so close to his skull that he appeared almost bald. Perhaps nearing fifty, though thickset and muscular, with the air of someone who knows how to throw a punch.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was told this was the place to find a good selection of books translated from English into French,’ I said. ‘Books that are not widely available, if you understand my meaning. Ask for Master Brinkley, I was told.’ Immediately his face tightened.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am Brinkley. But it would depend which titles you are looking for. I don’t think we have had the pleasure of your custom before, monsieur? I would be interested to know who recommended my shop. I have only a small clientele, as you can imagine, and they are Englishmen for the most part. But you are not French either, I don’t think?’ I noticed his eyes flicker to the outer door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, do not let me disturb you, if you are expecting somebody,’ I said, following the direction of his gaze.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not at all – I am expecting no one.’ But his face had grown wary.</p>
<p class="indented">‘In answer to your question – I am Italian, and it was an old friend, Père Paul Lefèvre, who suggested I visit you,’ I continued. ‘He told me a great deal about you and spoke highly of your shop as a place where one might find all manner of hidden treasures difficult to obtain elsewhere.’</p>
<p class="indented">Brinkley was struggling to hide his confusion. ‘Is that so? God rest his soul. You have heard the news, I suppose?’</p>
<p class="indented">I composed my face into a solemn expression and lowered my eyes. ‘Diabolical. That anyone could strike a man of God in cold blood like that. Huguenots, we must presume.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That would be the most convenient theory,’ the young man broke in, hotly. Brinkley shot him a warning glance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And I see you do not believe it. But convenient for whom?’ I turned to him, but it was Brinkley who answered.</p>
<p class="indented">‘If he was your friend, you will know where he has been making enemies of late.’ He came out from behind his counter, arms folded across his chest, gently intimidating. I took a step back towards the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah. I see your meaning.’ I mimed a mincing walk in imitation of the King. This obviously pleased him, because his face relaxed a fraction and he almost cracked a smile. The paper rustled inside my doublet as I moved. ‘If that is the case, then we are all in danger,’ I said, dropping my voice and sending him a complicit look.</p>
<p class="indented">He had regained his composure now and was not to be drawn. ‘I’m not sure what you mean by that, monsieur, or who you regard as <em class="calibre6">we</em>?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I mean—’ I leaned in – ‘that if the royal family will strike at anyone who speaks ill of the King, there can be few people in Paris who would escape that charge.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Only you know your own conscience there, monsieur. For myself, I do not speak ill of the King or his appointed heir. Has someone suggested otherwise?’ He held my gaze, impassive. He was waiting for me to slip up, give myself away; clearly he suspected I was a spy. I would have done the same in his place.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course not. I spoke in general terms only.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In any case,’ he said, shifting half a step towards me, arms still folded, ‘I barely knew Père Lefèvre. He may have come in once or twice but he was not a regular customer. Why don’t you tell me which books interest you and I will see if I stock them?’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded. ‘But I believe we may have another acquaintance in common. A friar from Saint-Victor by the name of Joseph de Chartres?’ I glanced at the door. ‘I thought I might run into him here today.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know no one of that name. I told you – I trade with Englishmen, for the most part.’ Brinkley’s glare grew more concentrated, but I detected a flicker of anxiety across his brow. It was impossible to tell whether he was speaking the truth. Behind me, a shadow passed across the shop window, blocking the light for an instant. I made a decision; a reckless one, but I felt I had to act, or we would be dancing around one another until nightfall.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Master Brinkley – may I speak frankly with you?’ I met his gaze full on.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wish you would, monsieur,’ he said, running a hand across his stubbled scalp, though the crease between his brows deepened.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Paul Lefèvre was supposed to deliver something to you today,’ I began.</p>
<p class="indented">He gestured to stop me and turned to the young man. ‘Come back later.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But—’ the boy tried to protest; Brinkley jerked his head sharply towards the door. Reluctantly, with a last reproachful look at me, the boy left.</p>
<p class="indented">Brinkley crossed and recrossed his arms and planted himself squarely in front of me, but his eyes darted constantly to the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who are you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘My name is Filippo. You are expecting this, I think.’ I took the two écus that Stafford had given me from my purse and tossed them on to the counter. Brinkley jumped and backed away. If anything, the money had made him more suspicious.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who sent you?’</p>
<p class="indented">By way of answer, I reached inside my doublet for the pamphlets. Before I had a chance even to unfold them, Brinkley’s face stiffened, eyes wide; he raised a hand as if to ward off a blow. We continued to stare at one another, each waiting for the other to speak, when the silence was broken by the click of the latch behind us. Brinkley started as if he had been stuck with a knife. I whipped around and my heart dropped.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah. Afternoon, Brinkley. Doctor Bruno – what a surprise.’ Paget, immaculate in a fur-trimmed cloak of plum velvet, ducked his head to enter and took off his hat, brushing non-existent dust from the brim and smoothing its feathers. He stopped, taking in the guilt and confusion on our faces, and his eyes locked immediately on to the paper in my hand. ‘What have you there?’</p>
<p class="indented">Before I could react, he leaned forward and whisked it from my grasp, uncreasing it and scanning the first few lines. I could feel the pulse beating hard at my throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know this man, sir. He just turned up here and shoved these at me.’ Brinkley was still backing away, as if putting his counter between us might afford him some protection. He appeared to be scared of Paget; this did not surprise me.</p>
<p class="indented">Paget flicked a hand in his direction as if to dislodge a fly, his eyes still running over the page. Eventually he lifted his head and fixed me with that infuriating expression of amusement. ‘Dear me, Bruno – this is not the sort of thing one should be waving around in public. Very dangerous. Did you write this?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course not.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I believe you, naturally. I’m not sure others would, though.’ He looked at me with a level gaze; I saw Brinkley flinch. ‘Imagine if you were caught with such a tract. People might not understand.’</p>
<p class="indented">Before I could stop him, he took two long strides across to the fire and threw the paper in. I watched in silence as it curled and blackened in the flames, cursing my impatience. I should have watched and waited; now Paget had destroyed the only evidence linking Joseph to Paul Lefèvre. He looked up at me and smiled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There. Wouldn’t want you or Master Brinkley compromised, would we?’ He turned to the printer. ‘Don’t worry about this man. We go back a long way.’ He clapped me on the shoulder. Brinkley continued to scowl at me, unconvinced. ‘Do you have my order?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh – yes, sir.’ Brinkley reached under his counter and produced the package the young man had handed over when I arrived.</p>
<p class="indented">Paget tucked it under his arm without offering payment. ‘Is that your money there, Bruno?’ he said, gesturing to the coins I had thrown on the counter. ‘Buying some of Master Brinkley’s fine books?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I changed my mind,’ I muttered, scooping up the coins as the printer followed them with his angry gaze.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not to worry – you can buy me a drink instead. Good day, Brinkley. Let me know if you come across anything you think I would enjoy reading.’ He cocked an eyebrow at the printer, replaced his hat on his head and swept out, holding the door for me to follow. I could feel Brinkley’s stare burning into my back even after I left the shop.</p>
<p class="indented">Paget strode away from the Palais without looking at me, though he clearly expected me to accompany him. After a few paces he turned, his face pinched with anger. ‘Perhaps you’d like to explain what in God’s name you hoped to achieve by frightening Brinkley with that pamphlet.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I owe you no explanation,’ I said. As soon as the words were out I regretted my choice of them.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No? Would you like to talk about what you do owe me, Bruno? An explanation would be the very least of it. I hope you enjoyed your dinner at the Swan today, by the way. You’re welcome. But if you were hoping Joseph de Chartres was going to turn up and walk into your arms, I shall be disappointed in you – I was led to believe you were an intelligent man.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What makes you think I was looking for Joseph?’ I said, falling into step beside him. I was not going to give him the satisfaction of thanking him for a debt I never asked him to repay.</p>
<p class="indented">He glanced at me from the tail of his eye. ‘You were caught stealing from his cell last night. He is still missing. I deduced that you found those papers and reasoned he might have intended them for a printer.’</p>
<p class="indented">I guessed Stafford must have told him about the pamphlets, and about Brinkley.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you knew Brinkley was printing propaganda for the League?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I make it my business to know everything that goes on through the English presses here.’ He lengthened his stride deliberately so that I had to half-run every few steps to keep up; a subtle humiliation. ‘This will do,’ he added, indicating a dim tavern leaning crookedly on the corner of the Boulevard de Paris.</p>
<p class="indented">Paget’s clothes and air of entitlement drew sharp glances and whispers from the other drinkers, mostly the lower ranks of clerks from the Palais, to judge by their dress, though he appeared not to notice as he pushed through the tap-room without apology and eased himself behind a table by the window, calling for a jug of hot wine.</p>
<p class="indented">‘How could you be so certain that Joseph would not come to the printer’s today, if you knew about their arrangement?’ I asked, sliding in beside him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Because he is not an idiot. Though I fear you may be.’ He leaned in, his face close to mine, hissing through his teeth. ‘What did you think you would get from Brinkley, showing him those papers?’ He reached out and gripped my arm hard; it was meant to hurt, but I did not flinch. He had bought me, for now, and this display was a reminder. Besides, for all his studied elegance, I suspected he would prove more than competent in a fight, even without a sword. His eyes never left mine.</p>
<p class="indented">I said nothing, though I pulled my face back from his hot breath. I was embarrassed to admit that I had panicked; I had hoped to frighten the printer into giving something away and instead I had only succeeded in destroying the evidence. We glared at one another for a long moment, eyes locked – I determined not to look away first – until eventually he made a noise of contempt and let me go.</p>
<p class="indented">‘All you have achieved is to put Brinkley and all his associates on their guard,’ he said, pouring the wine. ‘They will go to ground now, or find another meeting-place. That hardly serves us well. Any of us.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will forgive me if I express some doubts about who exactly you mean by <em class="calibre6">us</em>,’ I said. ‘I find it hard to believe we are working to the same ends.’</p>
<p class="indented">He leaned his head back against the wooden panelling, took a sip of his wine and laughed softly. He was a handsome man, I could not help noting, with a pinch of envy; chestnut hair swept back and barely touched with grey, a strong jaw framed by a neat beard and curling moustaches, lively brown eyes implying an impish spirit that belied his years. A most dangerous instrument, Walsingham had said. I must remind myself of that.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, you are right to question my feelings towards you, Bruno,’ he said, stretching out along the bench, a half-smile still playing around his lips. ‘A number of my closest comrades have suffered greatly as a result of your actions. Two of them cruelly executed. Others jailed, lost everything. Years of planning turned to dust in our hands. Men I counted on fled into hiding, scattered through France and Spain, including my own brother. I freely confess there was a time I would gladly have disembowelled you myself.’ He raised his tankard to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where is your proof that any of this was my doing?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, come now – we’re beyond such delicate pretence, surely? Guise had his spies in the French embassy too, you know. Nothing you did there was as secret as you thought.’ He took another drink, watching me over the rim. ‘I heard you tried to seduce the ambassador’s wife.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She tried to seduce me, in fact.’ I lifted my cup and put it down again, untouched; better to keep a clear head around Paget.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sure she did. You can spare me the details. The point is that I recognise a worthy adversary when I see one. Since your victory two years ago I have been curious to meet you. Walsingham imagines he has a nose for ingenious men, but in truth many of his informers are no better than hired hands, easily won over with a better coin. You are a different prospect, I think. You are motivated by <em class="calibre6">higher aims</em>.’ He ran a finger along the edge of his cup, smiling as if he found the idea charming and quaint.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You concede we are adversaries, then.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Times change, Bruno, and a wise man bends with them. I spend a good deal of time at the English embassy now. Stafford has finally accepted that I am well placed to be useful to England.’</p>
<p class="indented">I thought again of Walsingham’s letter. ‘And what do you gain from it?’</p>
<p class="indented">He heaved a long sigh and his shoulders slumped as he peered into his drink, as if it might hold the answer. ‘Eventually, I hope, a pardon, if I can prove my worth to Her Majesty. I am sick of exile. Aren’t you?’ He raised his head and fixed me with a frank look. ‘You must be nearing forty. We are of an age. The time of life when a man wants a home, a hearth, a sense of his place in the world, not this rootlessness. Wouldn’t you choose to go back, if they would pardon you?’</p>
<p class="indented">I glanced away to the early dusk, the grey November street. A sudden image of sunlight on lemon trees flashed through my memory. ‘You are guilty of treason.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are guilty of heresy. And yet here we both are, begging to be taken back, any way we can. You hope to petition the Papal nuncio, I understand.’</p>
<p class="indented">I tried not to show any reaction. ‘Did Paul tell you that?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doesn’t matter how I know. Just reminding you again that your secrets don’t stay hidden for long. Well, we shall see. Walsingham has pardoned worse offenders than I, if they make sufficient amends. And I’m sure His Holiness has pardoned greater heretics than you.’ He paused, stroking a drop of wine from his moustache with a swipe of his forefinger. ‘Can’t think of any at present, but one must always live in hope.’ Another calculated hesitation. ‘And have I not proved that I can also be useful to you, Bruno, these past days?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is it you want from me, Paget?’ I folded my hands around the tankard and concentrated on the rough wood of the table, its whorls and gouges.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It seems to me,’ he said, pouring more wine for me, though I had not yet touched what I had, ‘that we are both looking for the same thing. We want to know who killed Paul Lefèvre, and why. I’m assuming Henri has set you to find out.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is your interest?’ I took a slow sip, keeping my eyes on his face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Paul was a significant conduit between the Catholic League and the English émigrés. He was entrusted with a great deal of confidential information from both sides. Naturally, a number of people have a stake in discovering who ordered his death.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Try asking Joseph de Chartres. Or your friend the Duke of Guise.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Guise was keen that I ask you.’ He flashed a wolfish smile.</p>
<p class="indented">I took another small draught of the wine to cover my reaction. ‘So you still work for him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would not be much use to England if I did not maintain the appearance of intimacy with Guise and his faction,’ he said, not meeting my eye. ‘You see, at first it was supposed by the League that the King was behind Lefèvre’s death, because of his preaching. It seemed the most obvious explanation.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not to the King.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He would hardly admit to it. But since it became known that the priest asked for you on his deathbed, the Duke has naturally become curious to know what he so urgently needed to impart to your ears.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If Guise has cause to fear what Paul might have said, that surely suggests he had an interest in keeping him silent.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You might be forgiven for thinking so. But as far as I can see, the Duke is deeply alarmed by this murder. More so since he learned that your enquiries had led you to Frère Joseph de Chartres.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I imagine he would be, given that Joseph writes pamphlets for the League.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It’s more embarrassing than that. De Chartres is a cousin of the Duke of Montpensier, who is the stepson of Guise’s sister.’ He arched an eyebrow to convey the difficulty.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then the connection seems obvious.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But Guise is adamant that he has had no direct contact with Joseph over League business, much less given him orders to kill anyone. I have known the Duke for some years now, and I would swear he is telling the truth. He is therefore keen to know who else Joseph might be involved with.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then he should probably address that question to Joseph himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Joseph has disappeared, as you know.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps Guise should ask around among his relatives.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I imagine he is making enquiries. But he fears that any day the King will press some wretch into declaring publicly that he, Guise, was behind it.’</p>
<p class="indented">I gave a dry laugh. ‘Has he not planned to do the same to the King?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I dare say. But he would prefer to find out the truth. From what I can see, he is worried.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So he thinks it would be quicker to threaten me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Has anyone threatened you?’ He held up his hands to prove his innocence. ‘I admit, that would likely have been his preferred method, if I had left you in the Conciergerie last night. I felt that was not the most effective way to proceed with a man like you. I would guess you are stubborn enough to make it a point of honour to resist hard questioning.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked away. Wouldn’t we all like to believe we have the strength to maintain our firmness of purpose in the face of rigorous interrogation? Though I had been roughed up and imprisoned for my public teachings in Rome and Geneva, I had chosen to flee rather than test my resolve at the hands of the Inquisition. I fear pain like any man.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So,’ he said, in a brisker tone, ‘why don’t you thank me for sparing you the Duke’s methods by telling me what Paul Lefèvre confided to you before he died? That is what everyone wishes to know.’</p>
<p class="indented">I turned my cup between my hands, nodding slowly. ‘So you can pass the information to Guise? Though you now say you are working for England’s interests.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It <em class="calibre6">is</em> in England’s interest.’ He clicked his tongue. ‘Let us say rather it is a question of trading information with Guise. I am only of use to England so long as Guise and his people have confidence in me. Just as your value to Walsingham lies in your intimacy with Henri. This is all one great game, Bruno – all of us playing one another off against the others. The trick is choosing which cards to hold and which to show. I should not have to explain that to you.’</p>
<p class="indented">He sat back and tipped the dregs of the jug into his own cup, watching me with an expression that hovered between amusement and anticipation. Born to double-dealing, murmured Walsingham’s voice in my ear.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Paul said nothing intelligible. I already told the friars that.’</p>
<p class="indented">His face tightened, all traces of humour vanished. ‘Of course you told the friars that. I want you to tell me the truth. You are doing yourself no favours.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is nothing to tell.’ I looked him in the eye as I drained my cup and stood. I never had the patience for the gaming table, to Sidney’s enduring disappointment, but I did at least have the face for it. Paget was furious, I could see, though he too was trying to show nothing; it was concentrated in the way he pressed his nails into the wood of the table, the ends of his fingers white. I threw down the gold écus on the table. ‘There is a downpayment on your trouble. I will bring the rest as soon as I possibly can. Then I will be out of your debt.’</p>
<p class="indented">Paget laid a hand over the coins and contemplated this. ‘I wish it were that simple, Bruno. Very well then – but you cannot complain later that I did not ask you nicely. I wonder which of us will find Frère Joseph first?’ He made it sound as if he were declaring a contest. I offered him the briefest bow and turned my back, though I could swear I heard him chuckling as I left. Somehow he always managed to give the impression that I had behaved exactly as he had predicted, that I was playing a part he had written for me in advance.</p>
