			<p class="bt-1st-para3">It was my habit when I lived with my friend Sherlock Holmes in our suite of rooms in Baker Street, during the season of grey winds and charitable spirits, to volunteer a portion of my time working at hospital. Two afternoons in the week I would bundle myself warmly and take myself off to Barts, there to assist the surgeons and other medical personnel with whatever overflow of duties my training as a general practitioner and my brief military experience allowed. The staff grew accustomed to my presence as a locum there, and though my duties were difficult, they were never dull, for one session might find me setting all the broken limbs inflicted by a carriage accident, and the next tending to the victims of another unhappy bout of smallpox or influenza in one of the many slums cloistered in forgotten corners of our sprawling city.</p>
			<p class="bt">On one such early evening late in December of the year 1887, I stood at the end of a ward devoted to accidental injuries hurriedly repacking my clean instruments in my leather medical bag, wondering just how put out Holmes would be if I arrived late for a string quartet recital<span class="charoverride3"> </span>at St. James’s Hall. To my considerable surprise, the man himself appeared strolling in my direction seconds later, swinging his stick, his tall, thin form seeming even taller and thinner in the faint, slanting light from beyond the distant door.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’m just finishing. However did you find me in this maze?” I asked him. Holmes knew his own way around Barts, for he had conducted extensive chemical researches there, but that did not explain his discovering my whereabouts.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Simplicity itself, my dear fellow: know thy best resources.” He spun his cane against the polished floor and caught it up just as it began to topple. “It is a farcical blunder to act alone when assistance could halve the time required.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Laughing, I asked, “And who assisted you, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’d made up my mind to consult the likeliest expert regarding the comings and goings within this anthill, and the third nurse I passed in the front hall sent me straight to you. It’s an easy matter to tell which of the caretakers has her finger on the pulse of the establishment, so to speak—she is invariably both the weariest-seeming and paradoxically the neatest. This one obviously had not slept in over twenty hours, but there wasn’t so much as a speck marring her nail beds. Such women have a marked tendency to know absolutely everything.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Now you mention it, I could have told you as much myself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, that’s all well and good, Watson, but I mentioned it first,” he admonished me severely, and I could not help chuckling again.</p>
			<p class="bt">“All right, all right.” I snapped my bag shut. “What’s the time?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Four forty-seven by my watch. I’ve a cab outside, always provided you are through with philanthropy for the day and are ready for Haydn.”</p>
			<p class="bt">We were making for the door when a pair of orderlies with a nurse entered, wheeling another unfortunate victim of misadventure lying upon a stretcher. The slim, fashionably dressed young man had clearly suffered a severe head injury, for his brow was cocooned in considerable bandaging. While he seemed careworn—from excess of leisure or excess of woes I could not say—he was certainly under five and twenty years of age. My reaction upon glimpsing him was typical of both the seasoned medico and the veteran of the battlefield; while I wished him every chance at a swift recovery, a colleague of mine had clearly already done all he could, and so since the patient was resting quietly, by instinct I paid him no more mind than I would a hale soldier on patrol. I had already stepped around the gurney when Holmes stopped in his tracks.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What’s happened to this poor fellow?” he asked in his blandest, most ingratiating tone.</p>
			<p class="bt">When the nurse—a charming and capable young woman by the name of Caric—saw that Holmes was with me, her stern face relaxed into her natural expression. “We hardly know, sir. Poor soul. He’s been robbed, that much is certain, for there’s nothing on his person to identify who he might be, and no money or valuables either. An ostler found him down by the river in Blackfriars, and called for a constable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And did the ostler arrive too late to see what had happened? Or had he glimpsed signs of a struggle and interfered in a more timely fashion?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s all right, Nurse Caric,” I assured her when her glinting brown eyes narrowed again, although I confess I was equally mystified by Holmes’s keen interest. “This is my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, whose area of expertise is the detection of crime.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She seemed marginally mollified, but her hand remained protectively upon the sheet covering her charge. “I suppose it’s all right, then, Doctor. The physician who treated him spoke with both the ostler and the constable when he was brought in, and I was with them. No fight was interrupted—the damage had already been done when he was discovered.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Excuse me, but where was this precisely?” Holmes asked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“In a narrow corridor off Pageantmaster Court, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Excellent. Do go on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I was saying that the fight was already finished,” she continued with more visible impatience. “But it seems that when the ostler found him lying on the ground, he spied another man peering from the other end of the alleyway. That man was most revolting in appearance, he said—he’d long, matted hair of yellowish grey, his back was hunched, his face was coarse with a terribly crooked broken nose, and he was dressed in the foulest rags the ostler had ever seen. But when the ostler cried out to him, the man disappeared, and the ostler thought it best to stay with the injured gentleman and call for help rather than chase after a beggar who may have had nothing to do with the assault. The ostler was a most reliable, steady sort, if you want my opinion, and if you don’t, the constable who left not half an hour ago shared it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, I should a thousand times rather solicit your opinion than a constable’s, Nurse Caric. The large number of hair follicles escaping your cap indicates that you have been on shift for over twelve hours, as is supported by the demarcations beneath your eyes, and yet despite the fact you have been hard at work—your hands, you see, are quite pink from repeated scrubbings—your apron is spotless, which indicates you must have changed it. Twice, I think, though I cannot be certain. Your opinion is invaluable, I assure you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I’ve changed my apron twice. But . . .” When Nurse Caric frowned, she wisely directed the expression at me rather than my companion.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was a compliment,” I explained. “He . . . Never mind him. Can you tell us anything further?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Smoothing down her fresh apron, she shook her head. “It’s a common enough occurrence, Doctor. A man walks into an alley and doesn’t walk out again. . . . If there truly were good angels watching over us, the least they could do would be to warn of such dangers. Leastaways, that’s what I think, and I don’t care who knows it. Pray God he awakens soon and knows himself when he does, for otherwise we’ve no chance of tracing anyone he loves to comfort him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I nodded soberly. As Nurse Caric spoke, the orderlies wheeled the white-faced unconscious gentleman into a bare, curtained alcove. When the nurse departed in search of a clean hospital gown to replace his soiled finery, I followed after her for two paces before I realized that Holmes remained firmly in place, staring with eyes like his fencing foils at the anonymous assault victim.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes,” I ventured, “the cab downstairs—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I wonder, Watson,” my friend declared, putting his index finger over his lips and rocking back on his heels in thought.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can see that. What do you wonder about, I wonder?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I wonder why this person is not wearing his own clothing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Stepping back to the gurney, I looked him over, thoroughly bemused; I could see no indications whatsoever pointing to borrowed attire, though I noted many signs he had suffered a thorough trouncing and been left in the filth of a dank passage. The young man wore the finest-quality woolen trousers. His waistcoat was done in rich, dark green velvet with polished mother-of-pearl buttons, his disheveled black silk cravat was of the most expensive cloth, and his superbly cut frock coat proved to be lined with navy satin when I pulled back the lapel.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why on earth do you say it isn’t his clothing?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The cuffs of his shirtsleeve.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I peered down at them; they were greatly muddied, but they fitted the unlucky boy perfectly well.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, not the fit. The second hole. They’ve been threaded with cuff links more widely apart in the past, and now someone has pierced straight through the celluloid again. You don’t mean to tell me that a man who can afford such togs has somehow lost two inches in circumference from his wrist and then not bothered to purchase himself new cuffs?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Rubbing his slender hands together, Holmes rounded the makeshift bed, his eyes never leaving the hospital’s latest unfortunate admission. I had seldom seen him so enamored of a puzzle. “I might add that the trousers fit, but the knee break is in the wrong place by a full two inches—always study the knees, my dear fellow; if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a score of times. And a costly waistcoat with that strange pucker near the lowest rib would certainly have caused an argument between me and my tailor, were I in this lad’s shoes—or rather, whoever’s shoes these are. But in any case, he could never have afforded any of it, begging for a living on the streets as he does.”</p>
			<p class="bt">At my expression of frank shock, Holmes leaned down to loosen the patient’s collar and gently finished removing his unpinned cravat. As he did so, I began to suspect that I too could glean conclusions from the evidence at hand, for something before me was not right—but just as was the case regarding the efficacy of nurses, it ultimately required Sherlock Holmes to articulate what I could only sense.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You see what I see, but what do you conclude from it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I cannot think.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, no, of course you can, you are simply unpracticed at taking mental leaps into the void. Shall I state the hypothesis as I view it, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Please do.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The lad is a beggar, I said. I know it because these marks of grime are not the results of a street brawl—they continue underneath his clothing. He was this filthy before the tussle, not just afterward. And witness his hands.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend lifted one of them for my closer inspection. The appendage was callused in several places, but the most peculiar thing about it was its fingertips. They bore evidence of having been moderately frostbitten, the phalanges revealing several small healed-over vesicles and also older marks which seemed to me evidence of still worse hemorrhagic blistering. As a doctor, I knew well enough what I was looking at—and yet, I had never seen such queer successive evidence of having habitually frozen one’s flesh before.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This is a common affliction, but solely among a particular set. The only men and women I have ever encountered with hands like these are those who work the shallow,” Holmes explained clinically, returning the unknown man’s limb to the bedsheets.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I beg your pardon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Apologies, but the street language of thieves’ cant invents appellations for practices that civilized English would prefer to ignore altogether, so on occasion my terminology cannot help but devolve into slang. ‘Working the shallow’ is a form of begging, not unlike a scaldrum dodge.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Defining a term by means of another term I equally cannot parse seems an inefficient way of explaining it to me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a logical remonstrance, my dear Watson!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, it was.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend’s lips quivered, settling into a self-depreciating smile. “In a scaldrum dodge, the mendicants self-administer injuries in order to appear more pitiful to potential benefactors. Cuts, bruises, abrasions, worse—when pleading for the odd charitable coin, a missing hand could mean the difference between starvation and sympathy.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, do you mean to tell me that there are those who would prefer to lose a limb than—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Than a life?” He raised expressive brows, momentarily looking up from the supine figure.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sighing, I pulled at a taut muscle in my shoulder. “Go on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Working the shallow, on the other hand, means begging in the dead of winter without proper clothing—as a deliberate strategy, mind—and the fewer garments they can get away with, the more money they are apt to take in. The amateurs attempt going without coats, while the most extreme practitioners bare themselves to the elements, pretending to have seconds previous pawned their last shirt and the like. So long as public decency is at least partially maintained, they will stop at nothing to appear penniless. We don’t see such desperation in the vicinity of Baker Street, but I’ve witnessed it plentiful times in Whitechapel and St. Giles, to name but two neighborhoods, and likewise in far too many others to list.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And I, in India. The poor wretches risk their health to do such a thing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The most daring of them risk everything.” My friend had commenced searching extensively through the young man’s garments, tucking his fingers into pockets and unbuttoning the extravagant waistcoat to search for hidden pouches. “If I’m right, and that is his trade, he wasn’t robbed of his identification at all—he simply had nothing of value on his person to steal, apart from the tiepin. The clothes would have garnered a tidy profit in a pawn shop, but ripping a man’s vestments from his body is not a crime to be enacted on a public street. Our hapless passersby are generally lured indoors if they’re to be stripped entirely. No, our thief was impulsive, in the market for small treasures easily carried off. A watch, a wallet, a coin purse, a ring—save for the tiepin, our man was destined for disappointment, however.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, <span class="charoverride3">what</span> tiepin?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“This cravat has a recent pinprick in it but no actual jewelry.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The missing tiepin, then,” I conceded, smiling even as I shook my head.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite so. Ah, here we are.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes pulled a thin scrap of paper from an inner waistcoat pocket and unfolded it, passing it to me after he had made a comprehensive inspection. It was a receipt from a furniture warehouse.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The true owner of the waistcoat just bought himself a large curio case, whoever he is,” I said, returning the small document to Holmes. “There is no name, though, and no delivery address—only information regarding the vendor. Small wonder the policeman overlooked it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Small wonder, and also every reason why he will fail to identify either the victim or the culprit,” my friend snorted, replacing the evidence with due care.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes,” I remarked, “we aren’t going to a Haydn concert, are we?”</p>
			<p class="bt">He gave me an innocent glance, an expression which on Sherlock Holmes looks like two parts surprise and one part mild injury. It was not an expression which, by the year 1887, fooled me in the smallest degree.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The tickets are in my coat pocket, my dear fellow, and if music is your pleasure, we’ll be rattling down the Strand toward Piccadilly within mere moments. Of course, this furniture warehouse <span class="charoverride3">does </span>happen to be located in Blackfriars, on Gardner’s Lane and High Timber Street, not far from where this unfortunate chap was attacked and left for dead.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I placed my hat on my head and picked up my bag. “Then we had better pay it a call, had we not?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes fairly grinned at me in agreement, tossed his stick and caught it again, and strode back in the direction of the Great Hall. We hastened down the staircase and out into the central courtyard, the garden a wash of sere winter tones, the grasses robbed of all moisture, and the fountain frosted over with ice. By some miracle, my friend’s cab was still waiting for him, the driver muffled under a wealth of blankets and mist emerging from the impatient horse’s nose.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we alighted some ten minutes later in Blackfriars, the sun was swiftly quickening its descent into the great dun-colored river, plunging like a fallen phoenix. The apothecaries were pulling down the shades behind their polished glass windows, and the pubs, with their lambent yellow fires, were beginning to glow all the brighter for the gloom, like scattered lighthouses in a sea of bluish-grey. It was that almost mystical time that is neither day nor night, the earth tipping into dusk, and I confess that I thrilled at the chance to be pursuing an unexpected case rather than whiling away our evening being passively entertained. Holmes had walked half a block farther toward the river with his silk hat pulled low over his brow when his hand suddenly caught my elbow.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Keep walking,” he murmured. “But pull out your watch and glance discreetly across the street as if you’re ascertaining how long it will take to arrive at your destination. Then look immediately back down at the time.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Settling my features into a blank, I did as he said and cast my gaze across the thoroughfare. One of the oddest creatures I have ever seen in all my travels approached us on the other side of the road, and my spine tingled when I recognized him by description. His stature was slight, his shoulders were rounded, his back was humped, and his gait was halfway between a lurch and a shuffle. He wore clothing of the filthiest repugnance, the sort of rotting and fetid garments draped over the skeletal limbs of the scavengers who drag the Thames for salable garbage or descend into the sewer system to dredge for lost coins—full of holes, hanging like so much tangled moss from his frame.</p>
			<p class="bt">All of these foul characteristics were as nothing, however, compared with the unhappy man’s face; his dirty grey hair hung in unevenly tangled knots around a visage which must initially have been loathsome, lumpen and coarse as it looked, but which was not assisted by a nose that had been badly broken many years previous, giving his vulture’s countenance a smashed effect.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend’s pace never varied, and it was not until we had rounded the corner that Holmes abruptly stopped and whirled about again, resting his fingers lightly against the brick edge of the building as he watched.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This is the furniture warehouse in question,” he informed me over his shoulder.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But Holmes, surely we can postpone that visit—if Nurse Caric is to be believed, doubtless here is the very man who may have seen the well-dressed beggar attacked.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“She is absolutely to be believed.” My friend paused. “Is that what you plan to call it when all is over and you convert fact to melodrama? ‘The Adventure of the Well-Dressed Beggar’ or some similar rubbish?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You need not presume to have already solved it,” I returned, perhaps with rather more pique than was necessary.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes only regarded me with an eyebrow cocked and his mouth quirked into an aloof smile. “Touché, Watson. Take off your coat and your scarf,” he instructed me imperiously, unwrapping his muffler and pulling his arms out of his own greatcoat as he did so.</p>
			<p class="bt">Reluctantly, I complied. When Holmes handed me his coat, I understood better what he intended and offered him my own. My tall friend’s cape-backed topcoat of black wool hung far below my knees, giving me a disreputable air; Holmes, conversely, on the instant he had donned my brown tweed, I found to be inexplicably six inches shorter than he had been before, and I laughed in spite of myself.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No longer John Watson and Sherlock Holmes, then,” I surmised.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, I’m afraid those chaps wouldn’t suit just now, as admirable as they are. Now, follow me and do exactly as I do.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When Holmes gained the opposite curb and joined the small stream of pedestrians, our subject had progressed a full block ahead of us. My friend selected a man who traveled at a brisk speed and fell into place directly behind him, his grey eyes locked blankly on our quarry over the stranger’s shoulder, as if unseeing and lost in thought. Before long, I had fallen into step behind my own shield, copying as best I could Holmes’s air of weary impatience to arrive at his destination.</p>
			<p class="bt">Doubtless my excitement was more visible than his, however, for Holmes had somehow retreated entirely within himself, and the man who under normal circumstances garnered furtive stares from strangers thanks to his remarkable appearance was now no more noticed than a crack in the cobblestones. His disguise was not properly a disguise at all—merely my own coat and a bowed gait which rendered him the same size as mere mortals—and yet his alteration was entire, and I could only reflect, as indeed did many of our friends from the Yard, that had Holmes wished to travel the world with the hot metal aroma of footlights ever in his nostrils, he would have been loudly applauded across the continents. It is a peculiarity inherent to my friend’s reserved nature, however, that while honest admiration from his sole companion and few esteemed colleagues can actually cause the man to blush, acclaim from the public falls upon wholly deaf ears, so perhaps after all Sherlock Holmes had chosen the profession which suited him best.</p>
			<p class="bt">After traversing a few blocks, passing by greengrocers and newsstands and shipping offices, the remarkably ugly man descended a series of steps into a pub called The Blind Elephant, with gaslights held in iron brackets hanging from either side of its entrance. Without blinking an eye, my friend likewise marched down the steps and opened the door of the tavern, and a rush of warm, ale-scented air passed over us as we entered.</p>
			<p class="bt">“At last!” the detective exclaimed eagerly. “The best house ale this side of London Bridge, my dear chap, or I am no judge—Perkins positively swears by the place, and by Jove, now I can see the reason.”</p>
			<p class="bt">All eyes went to Holmes, and then all eyes immediately slid off him again, just as he intended—for in a crowded metropolis, there is no way to skirt attention more effectively than by demanding it. Our surroundings were certainly cozy, for The Blind Elephant was equipped with secondhand club furnishings, so rather than the rough benches and rickety stools typical of such an establishment, Holmes and I sank into faded, scratched leather armchairs, each with a glass of passable porter in his hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">The hideous figure we had been pursuing, meanwhile, returned to urgent conversation with the bartender just after our drinks had been poured. The proprietor was a short, swarthy, balding fellow with his scant dark hair slicked over his head. His attention to the beggarly man was complete—indeed, deeply sympathetic—and I marveled that such a low figure could command such seeming respect. Holmes was similarly puzzled, and while he appeared to focus on sipping his beer, his blank expression was enough to tell me that he was riveted to the exchange taking place.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My men have been on it these two hours,” the barman said soothingly. “Come now, Mr. Marwick. It’s not right to see you take on so when you’ve done no ’arm to anyone. I’ve Scott Monty on the prowl, and Leatherfinger Jim as well. ’E’s not likely to escape our clutches.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But if he should get away entirely!” gasped the malformed creature, clutching a glass of brown spirits. His voice was as unappealing as the rest of him—a strange mixture of rasp and whine that scraped the ears. “Oh, Mr. Piccone, I would never recover from it. What use has my life been if this deed goes unpunished? I tell you that I would simply expire.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Drink up, now, Mr. Marwick,” Mr. Piccone suggested, again lending to the remark an air of deference which I could not begin to fathom.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Marwick took a sip of what looked like whiskey, but his palsied hand spilled half of it on the tabletop. Mr. Piccone clucked paternally, as only excellent barkeepers can, and wiped up the spill as if it had been his own fault. Then he replaced what had been lost and settled with his elbows upon the bar before his repugnant customer, awaiting further discourse.</p>
			<p class="bt">“All of this is my accursed doing,” groaned Mr. Marwick. “When I have my hands on him, I’ll—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ll nothing. Leave it to Monty and Leatherfinger—you know they won’t take long once they’ve run him to ground. ’Ave a speck of patience, Mr. Marwick, only a speck, and all will come right. I promise. Take another sip, and then off ’ome with you, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I wouldn’t be able to bear the sight of the place, I tell you—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“None of that! No indeed. I’ll ’ave none of it, and there’s gospel in your ear. You’ve a dinner to oversee. Trust me. I know what’s best to be done.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Marwick finished the drink by holding the tumbler with both his hands. Then, nodding gratefully to the bartender without paying him a cent, he picked up his cane and staggered off.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes was dropping coins on the bar before I had got to my feet, and twenty more seconds saw us outside again, shivering at the wind. I ducked my head, and we ghosted along after the strangely riveting Mr. Marwick. While Holmes yet maintained the pretense of distraction, I could not compel my own eyes to shift from our remarkable quarry, and so gave it up after two blocks as a bad job. To my surprise, he seemed to be leading us directly back to our initial destination. Upon reaching the door of the furniture warehouse, Mr. Marwick scowled at a piece of trash and kicked it off the shallow single step, and then drew out a large key. Upon either side of the wide entrance there were iron railings, one of which he stopped to polish with his stained pocket handkerchief. Then he opened the door and went inside.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, he owns the place,” my friend exclaimed softly. “I have never seen anyone behave in a more custodial manner in my life.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You noted, of course, that the barman gave him every courtesy.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Obviously, yes—it perplexed me for a moment, but now that I have more data, the situation reveals itself without much work required on my part. He could not have been anyone <span class="charoverride3">excepting</span> the warehouse’s owner. I ought to have expected as much, when his walking stick was considered.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“His walking stick, Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, I’ve some suspicion as to who this altogether odd chap is. Should you like your coat back? I confess that taking this many inches off my own height can be taxing when I haven’t mentally prepared for it—one stretches extensively, then resigns oneself to temporary agony, and the like. In any case, I rather think that Sherlock Holmes and John Watson will fill the bill perfectly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">With that remark, Holmes appeared to consider concealment no longer of any use to us, and we quickly exchanged outer garments. My friend then promptly walked to the door Mr. Marwick had entered and pressed the bell.</p>
			<p class="bt">A sliding panel whipped open, and a pair of rheumy, unlovely eyes glared out at us.</p>
			<p class="bt">“We’ve closed shop for the night,” grated Mr. Marwick’s strident voice.</p>
			<p class="bt">“We’re particularly interested in purchasing a curio case, Mr. Marwick,” my friend returned tranquilly.</p>
			<p class="bt">After a blink, what we could see of the man’s face contorted into a scowl. “I say that we’re <span class="charoverride3">closed,</span> confound it! Look elsewhere. Good day!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But we are particularly interested in <span class="charoverride3">your </span>curio cases, you understand.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The devil take you! What can the likes of you know of curio cases?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Marwick, I assure you that I intend the Amateur Mendicant Society no harm whatsoever. My sole interest is in assisting the patient of my medical friend here, and we know that—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You know nothing!” the little figure in the window panel screamed viciously. Two unsteady fists banged upon the inner doorframe and then ground into anguished eye sockets. “There is <span class="charoverride3">no such thing </span>as the Amateur—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps if I were to introduce myself: I happen to be the employer of a group of street children known as the Baker Street Irregulars. My name is Sherlock Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The portal snapped shut. Off went the clumsy footsteps, and back they returned accompanied by the faint rattling of keys. When Mr. Marwick opened the door, he gestured at us to enter with an awkward flailing of his arm.</p>
			<p class="bt">Even if Holmes knew by this point with whom we were dealing, I had not an inkling, and so took in my surroundings rather than ask potentially damaging queries. As a warehouse, the space was organized very poorly indeed: cobwebs and grime covered the major pieces of furniture, while smaller items sat huddled in unappealing clumps, many shrouded beneath cheap linens. An aroma of dust and mildew permeated the place, and the floor did not appear to have been swept at any point during the previous decade. The wide room conveyed the impression of complete dereliction, a graveyard for housewares rather than a display of them. I did not pity those forced to do business there, but I hereby confess I did not envy them either. Additionally, Mr. Marwick did not add any special felicity to the atmosphere, for the hideous fellow still seemed furious at our interruption—although now furious as well as inclined to discourse.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What’s this now? I’ve heard rumor of your boys. You’re truly Sherlock Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The very same, and at your service,” the detective assented. “This is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson, whose medical skills are often made use of by St. Bartholomew’s Hospital.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Is Jeremy all right?” Mr. Marwick demanded to know of me next, clutching at my coat sleeve.</p>
			<p class="bt">“When I left him, nothing indicated to me that his condition had grown at all unstable,” I answered. “He is resting, his injuries have been seen to, and while I did not tend to them myself, I’m confident my colleague did all he could.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, that’s something, then. It’s not much, but it’s something. Oh, what a wretched day. If you’re Sherlock Holmes, I suppose you know all of it by now,” he accused my friend scornfully.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can make a confident and educated surmise, nothing more. I presume the young man . . . Jeremy, did you say?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Jeremy Kitchen.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Kitchen, then, was mistaken by street thugs for a rich gentleman and—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Wrong. That’s the worst of it,” our host snarled through a clenched jaw. “He wasn’t mistaken for a rich man at all. But since you probably know everything else, I suppose I would do better to show than to tell you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are hosting the annual dinner tonight, then?” Holmes inquired, a silvery thread of suppressed excitement in his tone.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Marwick nodded. “If you both will vow to reveal nothing of what you’ve seen here to any living soul, I’ll show it to you, though I have never done such a thing in ten long years. If it were not for your Irregulars, I should not even consider it, but their existence inspires me to trust you. Do I have your word that you will protect my secret?”</p>
			<p class="bt">When Holmes had given his promise, I readily agreed despite my perplexity, and the three of us walked to the back of the warehouse, entering a smaller room within a great open space that must have once been an office, but now appeared simply a repository for crumbling yellowed papers. A sharply descending staircase was revealed at the back of this chamber, its metal steps and rails spiraling downward, and on the subterranean level, we found ourselves in a hallway lined with more unclaimed furnishings. Mr. Marwick reached behind a featureless bookshelf, and with the smallest click of a concealed lever, it swung to and revealed itself a doorway.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My God,” I breathed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I never imagined I’d see it in person,” Holmes added softly. “Thank you for your confidence, Mr. Marwick. This is truly an unlooked-for pleasure.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The spacious room we entered, quite as long as the warehouse above us and filled with the happy sounds produced by flowing wine and rollicking cheer, was unmatched for opulence against any I have ever heard report of in England. It was walled in alternating dark carved rosewood and panels of mirror, while above our heads six enormous matched chandeliers blazed forth like small suns. I could spy no servants, but on every surface were heaped the most sumptuous presentations of food: mountains of cakes and jellies, piles of fine cheeses and cold meats, all the fruit it was possible to procure in the middle of winter, seemingly limitless crystal glasses of champagne.</p>
			<p class="bt">And the people! Such elegance I had never before seen amassed in a single congregation, nor have I witnessed a gathering where the guests seemed to be enjoying themselves and each other more. Every attendee was bedecked in silk, velvet, and lace, and on every face a giddy smile shone forth. Then, with a comprehensive start of understanding, I noticed that a man a few yards distant from me had not shaved in months or perhaps even years, and that another neighbor was missing the farthest joints of three of his fingers, very probably owing to their having been severely frostbitten.</p>
			<p class="bt">“We’ll walk on through,” muttered Mr. Marwick. “They know nothing of who I am, Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The opposite side of the sumptuous gallery featured a second door, and we exited through it, passing a guard who made a small bow to Mr. Marwick. Here the tunnel seemed to stretch far into the distance, lit all the way by wall sconces.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There is one guard at the basement’s inner door and one at the ground-floor outer,” said Mr. Marwick. “The mendicants’ entrance, you see, is through a service gate at the opposite end of the warehouse, the part which generally serves as a scrap yard. You, Mr. Holmes, have somehow managed to set eyes upon this year’s ticket, and thereby discovered my address. I assume Jeremy had it on his person?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Exactly. The receipt for the curio case was in Mr. Kitchen’s inner pocket.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Our host led us down the gently sloping corridor until we reached another door, this one quite plain. When we had all taken seats in comfortable armchairs in what appeared to be Mr. Marwick’s actual office, the fire blazing, no one seemed willing to speak at first. Sherlock Holmes, as was usual, took the lead.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The impoverished boys I pay to be my eyes and ears first told me of the beggars’ feast several years ago,” my friend informed us in a careful tone. “One was very proud when he discovered it was called the Annual Meeting of the Amateur Mendicant Society, for details surrounding the affair seemed a zealously kept secret.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So they have been, until today,” Mr. Marwick confirmed ruefully. “Those who had attended were encouraged to speak of it in the wildest terms, as a legend no more plausible than a pot of leprechaun gold.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The tickets granting one entrance to the event—the curio case receipt, in this instance, with the warehouse’s address plainly printed—were disseminated only to beggars. Beyond that, all my boys could agree upon was that it was a pauper’s only chance to attend a banquet fit for a king and be dressed free of charge for the occasion, and also that none of them knew the identity of their annual host.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Their host is one Mr. Cowderoy Marwick,” the man who seemed the lowest of all beggars sniffed. “And they will never know it. Never. I have a single confidant, and that is Mr. Piccone, who owns a tavern down the street. The rest suppose I am merely a vendor of used furnishings, though to be frank with you, no one ever buys anything, as I’ve deliberately made the ground floor as inhospitable as possible. They also know me as a former tailor who is paid to perform their fittings for the soiree; I’ve amassed a large stock of attire in the dressing rooms below the warehouse. That occupation allows me to drop mysterious hints regarding the ‘true’ organizer of the feast, you understand, and so is ultimately quite useful as regards misdirection. Now, sir, tell me what you believe to have happened today.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes cocked his dark head in thought. “You have already corrected me on that count—the reason Mr. Kitchen was attacked was not that he was presumed wealthy. But I believe I am right in saying he arrived at the warehouse, perhaps for a fitting, earlier this afternoon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Marwick flinched. “Yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I presume you make it a hard-and-fast rule no one is ever to depart the premises while wearing the garments, for fear of assault? But Mr. Kitchen was . . . lured away somehow?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“His equally impoverished lady love had come by a ticket, but thought it fanciful nonsense and had no intention of coming.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah. Mr. Kitchen wanted to persuade her that the feast was real, lest she throw away a singular opportunity. What could convince her faster than to show her his attire? I fear you will have to enlighten me as to the rest.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have it on the best authority—that of a street Arab, and you know as well as I do, Mr. Holmes, that I mean nothing ironical in that statement—that Jeremy was attacked by the resident ruffian in this neighborhood, a homeless brute who resents the fact that despite his swagger and bluster, he has never been issued an invitation,” Mr. Marwick said in a tone of deepest grief. His voice had somehow become less abrasive than previously, or perhaps it simply grew more pleasant to the ear over time. “His name is Tom Scripps. We believe that when he saw Jeremy’s clothing, he at once surmised that he would be a guest that night and took his revenge, stealing the diamond tiepin I had lent only as an afterthought. I pursued the foolish boy the moment I knew he was gone, but arrived too late. When I was discovered at the scene by the policeman, I admit that panic possessed me and I fled, although rage was not far behindhand. Thanks to my appearance, I am not always treated well by the constables making their rounds, you understand, and do my utmost to avoid them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">We were all silent for several moments. Then Holmes asked, “What actions have you taken, then, save for enlisting local aid to hunt for the guilty party?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll not ask how you knew that, for by all accounts, you know practically everything. Yes, Mr. Piccone has roused associates to run this villain down. It was the final straw, Mr. Holmes—Tom Scripps has bullied and bloodied quite enough of his fellow mendicants. He beats them for sport, steals their earnings. No act is too low for the blackguard. I cannot say what precisely Mr. Piccone’s men intend, save that I gave explicit instructions Scripps should be ejected from the area and not harmed in any lasting fashion—but I could think of nothing else to do. Vigilantism is abhorrent to me, but bearing in mind a penniless child was the only witness, I fear formal charges would never hold up in court.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend sat forward in his chair, pressing his fingertips together before his aquiline nose. “Mr. Marwick, while I understand that we are acquainted solely by virtue of reputation, I wonder if you would consent to engage my services in this matter. Allow me to speak with Mr. Piccone, and I swear to you I shall watch this Tom Scripps so doggedly that an ironclad conviction—although perhaps for another crime, I grant—will be ours within the week. Surely it would be better for me to introduce the scoundrel to a stint at hard labor than for your associates to carry any sort of retaliatory violence upon their own consciences, and I assure you that for my part, nothing could be simpler.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Marwick’s features gradually softened. “Why would you do such a thing?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is a charitable season of the year,” my friend pointed out with studied nonchalance. “And I would require in return that when you assemble your next feast’s guest list, you allow me to make a few of my own small nominations. They may be a trifle younger than your usual attendees, but I can vouch without qualm for their characters, if not their cleanliness.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How many are ‘a few small nominations,’ precisely?” Mr. Marwick asked shrewdly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, heavens, certainly not more than a dozen Irregulars at the most,” Holmes returned with aplomb. “Some of them <span class="charoverride3">very </span>small indeed, though I readily admit you’d not know it by their appetites. Look to young Peaches particularly—he’s not yet eight and could single-­handedly dispatch Buckingham Palace’s larder, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>
			<p class="bt">It required Mr. Marwick a few moments’ thought before he reached a conclusion, and when he did, he simply rose and shook my friend by the hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Capital!” the detective exclaimed. “The bargain is struck, Mr. Marwick. By week’s end, you may expect to hear of Tom Scripps’s relocation to the dock.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes and I were turning to go when a question stopped us.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But tell me, Mr. Holmes—how could you have known when you first knocked at my door that I, of all people, was the founder of the Amateur Mendicant Society? I have lived like this for so long, I thought myself beyond suspicion for a millionaire.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ve St. Alexius’s name inscribed upon your walking stick—which is a remarkably fine one, I might add,” my friend replied readily. “Forgive me, Mr. Marwick, but might I ask why you would dispose of your fortune in such a strange fashion?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’m the last Marwick, Mr. Holmes,” the grotesquely compelling man responded. “I have no one left in this dark world to gift with an inheritance. In any event, the entire Marwick estate was built upon the very profitable alliance between rum and African slaves, and for that matter has never done me a single particle of good in all my life. I’ve given away a quarter of a million to various causes so far, Mr. Holmes, most of them quite conventional. But—before tonight’s tragedy, of course—I’ve never seen anything I’ve done bring the impoverished as much joy as the Amateur Mendicant Society. The highest honor I can grant myself is that I managed to think of it in the first place.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes,” I said once we had regained the street, and the gas lamps had spread into pools of warmth brightening the winter’s frosted air, “I have never been more gratified to have missed a Haydn concert. And that was very good of you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He waved one hand companionably at me while searching out his cigarette case with the other.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But please do tell me, who is St. Alexius, and how on earth do you know of him?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The Irregulars informed me that the dinner’s final toast, or so they had heard, was lifted in honor of St. Alexius.” My friend smiled. “I’d never heard of him either, but I did a little research and soon had my answer. St. Alexius was the only son of an extravagantly wealthy Roman senator, and he fled his privileged existence to live in the most austere poverty. I freely confess to you that I had supposed his kind had passed out of the world long ago. But on occasion, there is nothing more congenial than being proved entirely wrong. Let’s you and I make a stop at Marcini’s for a hot meal after we’ve spoken with Mr. Piccone, my dear fellow, for I believe the coming week will see me a very preoccupied individual.”</p>
