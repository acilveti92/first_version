				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack lay on his back, looking up at the stars. He had never paid them much heed before. Indeed, he did not think he had truly noticed them until he left his mother’s gin palace in Whitechapel to join the redcoats. There was little sky to be seen in the stinking rookery in which he had been brought up. In the enclosed confines of the city, it was hard to even make out the sky in the narrow gaps between the tops of the buildings, or through the near-impenetrable smog that filled the air no matter what the season. In the rookeries, staring up at the heavens was asking for trouble. Letting your guard down, even for a single heartbeat, was a quick route to an early grave, a final trip down to the Thames, the last resting place for so many of the denizens of the foul places where no one sane or sober chose to go.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Now he gazed at a sky with more stars than he could count. He liked their serenity. Whatever happened, they continued to look down, unperturbed by sorrow or by war. They did not care if someone lived, or if they died. If someone stole a scarlet coat or dreamt of a future far removed from the one allotted to them. The stars were always the same.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He heard a noise, a scrabble of feet not far from where he lay. He closed his eyes, shutting off his view of the heavens as he concentrated his hearing on the sound. It could have been an animal; a whole menagerie of beasts stirred when the darkness arrived, to scuttle and hurry about their business through the cold night hours before the sun rose. Yet he could hear breathing, the subtle sound of someone trying very carefully to be completely quiet.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Jack?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The icy whisper still took him by surprise. His body jolted at the sudden call, a rush of blood surging through his veins to hammer noisily in his ears. Gingerly he eased himself into a sitting position, scanning the darkness. As he did so, his manacles and fetters clattered noisily.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Hush.’ The voice urged him to silence.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack did his best to obey, moving with infinite slowness as he manoeuvred round so that he could face the soft voice that had murmured from the darkness. He could just make out a thin silhouette bending towards him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Hush yourself.’ He spoke quietly. He knew who had come to disturb his peace. ‘You shouldn’t be here.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Be quiet.’ The voice delivered the rebuke with a little more force, its owner clearly annoyed that Jack was treating the situation in such a glib manner. ‘I’ve come to rescue you.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack did his best not to laugh aloud at the bold announcement. ‘And how do you propose to do that, Isabel?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel Youngsummers crept forward and gently slid to her knees beside him. Even in the dim light Jack could see her flushed cheeks, the exhilaration at her escapade clear. She had bound her hair into a dark blue headscarf and swathed her body in a thick brown cloak, both for warmth and to deaden the brightness of her dress.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘If you are going to speak to me in that tone, then perhaps I’ll not bother.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You shouldn’t be here, Isabel. Your father will have a fit if he finds out.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He won’t know.’ Isabel spoke quickly and quietly.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">She was right to be confident. It was unlikely anyone would hear her. The bivouac was never completely quiet, the sounds of men snoring, farting and fidgeting loud enough to cover any whispered conversation. The real danger came from a sentry spotting the extra silhouette near where Jack should have been sitting in isolation. Yet the sentries’ job was to face outwards, scanning the ominous shadows for danger, so the risk of discovery was small. But that did not stop Jack fretting. Isabel would be severely rebuked for her exploits if she were discovered, and he did not want her to be punished for his sake.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You should go back.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Never,’ Isabel replied firmly. ‘I shall never go back.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Never?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He wants to send me home.’ There was real pain in her voice. ‘He has vowed to book me on the next available steamship. He will send to me my aunt’s, where I will sit and do nothing until I am married off. I would rather die.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He’ll likely kill you himself if he discovers you talking to me.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I’m not here to talk to you, you ninny. I said I have come to rescue you, and so I shall.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack lifted his arms, showing her the heavy manacles that bound his hands, grimacing at the pain the gesture provoked. The skin around the clasps had been rubbed raw, chafed by the unyielding metal so that it was bloody and weeping. ‘And what about these?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel smiled with devilment, her eyes alive with her own daring. ‘Oh. I hadn’t thought about that. Why, if only I had the key.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Her hand fished beneath her cloak and she produced a pair of heavy iron keys with all the panache of a music hall magician.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked at her in admiration. ‘Blow me. How did you get those?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel chuckled at the look of surprise on his face. ‘Oh, now you’re interested. You still want me to go back?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack grinned. ‘I do. But give me the damn keys first.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel pulled back her hand, removing the keys from his reach. ‘Oh no you don’t. If I give you these, you must promise to take me with you.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Take you with me? Take you where, exactly? If I make a run for it, I will be hunted like a damn fox. You would not want that.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You’re right. I don’t. But we won’t be on the run.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Really? Perhaps you are an angel then, using your godly powers to spirit us away. For there is nowhere to hide here.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel looked nervously over her shoulder as Jack took the Lord’s name in vain. It would take a long time for her father’s shadow to leave her side.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘There is.’ She spoke firmly and with obvious confidence. ‘I’ve thought it all through. I know exactly where we shall go. And once we are there, no one will be able to reach us.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘My God, Isabel, are you corned? Did you steal some of your father’s brandy?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel flickered her free hand forward, deftly delivering a gentle slap to his arm. ‘Of course not.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Then what’s your plan? Where is this wonderful sanctuary? Where can we hide where no one will find us?’ Jack fired the questions at her, a trace of annoyance in his voice. He would be happy to risk an escape, for he truly had nothing left to lose. But he did not have high hopes of success; the local people would certainly not be willing to offer shelter to a white-faced stranger. But it was worth a try, if only to irk Lieutenant Fenris.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘We shall go to the Maharajah. He’ll save us. We will join his court.’ She smiled the sweet smile of victory, for she was quite correct. She had thought of the one place where they would be safe.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Only the Maharajah could save them now.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack took Isabel’s hand as they crept through the bivouac. He could see the sentries at their posts, the two pairs of redcoats staring dutifully into the darkness as they willed away the long hours of their sentry duty. He kept a close eye on them as he led Isabel through the sleeping camp, hoping that no one could hear the pounding of his heart, which seemed loud enough to wake the dead.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He kept well away from the slumbering redcoats, guiding Isabel in a wide circle as he aimed for the small group of horses that had been tethered together a short distance from where the officers had chosen to rest for the night. The camp was still in the dead hours after midnight, the last wakeful redcoats settling down for some rest before the next day’s march, which would begin before the daylight crept back to scour the darkness away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel let out a gasp of distaste as they moved out of the last light of the fires. ‘What on earth is that?’ She raised a hand to her face, trying to protect her mouth and nose from the foul aroma.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack turned and saw the look on her face. He grinned. ‘The latrine. Try not to step in anything.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘That’s horrid.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel’s disgust was evident, but he had chosen the route with care. Anyone seeing movement heading towards the temporary latrine would think nothing of it; many of the redcoats stumbled into the darkness to relieve themselves during the night. Once past the reeking pits they would be able to move rapidly towards the horses that offered their best chance of escape.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack risked a glimpse back over his shoulder as he led Isabel into the night. He had used her cloak to improvise the slumped shape of a sleeping figure, arranging it so that anyone checking on him would see what looked like a slumbering form. It would not fool his captors for long when the company prepared to march, but by then he hoped he and Isabel would be far away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He rubbed at the sores on his wrists, relishing the freedom of movement. He had learnt from bitter experience that even the worst pain did not last for ever, even the most vicious of wounds healing with time. At least, that was true for wounds to the body. Wounds to the soul were different, only ever scabbing over, the tears and fissures left to fester beneath. But he had learnt not to pick at those, letting them rot in the depths of his mind, the pain dulled by familiarity yet never completely going away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">It did not take long to reach the horses. He let Isabel go first; she was more experienced with the animals then he was. She moved forward quickly, murmuring sweet nothings as she approached the horse she had ridden that day. It gave a quiet whinny of recognition and blew loudly through its nostrils as it smelt the open hand Isabel held to its nose.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked around, anxiously scanning the slumbering bivouac for signs of alarm. All was still, the redcoats blissfully unaware that the impostor they had been sent to arrest was making off. He saw the sleeping form of Lieutenant Fenris, the young officer enjoying the peaceful rest of the victorious. Jack only wished he could be there when Fenris realised that his prisoner had escaped.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He smiled at the notion. He knew there was unfinished business between the two of them. The kind of business that could only be settled sword in hand. As Isabel deftly saddled two of the horses, he wondered when that encounter would come. For he knew Fenris would not rest until he had been brought low, the lieutenant’s hatred sure to be fanned by his disappearance with Isabel. He relished the idea. He would not shirk from the fight, whenever it came.</p>
