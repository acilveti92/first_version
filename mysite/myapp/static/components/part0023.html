			<p class="bt-1st-para3">September of the year 1900 will be forever associated in my mind with the Iron Hand, simultaneously the name of a vicious criminal network which had been terrorizing the St. Katharine Docks and of its anonymous leader, a ruthless dictator whose identity was so fiercely guarded that his orders were carried out solely by lieutenants bearing tattoos of sinister claws on their forearms. Had the band been a typical collection of crude miscreants, they should never have come to the attention of Sherlock Holmes, in the same sense that master sculptors are not hired to lay brick. But as their violence increased in audacity, so did the legends surrounding their commander, and Holmes began to note odd discrepancies which had eluded the attention of the regular force. Some two weeks, eight previously unsolved murders, and countless other offenses later, it will be recalled that the Iron Hand himself proved nothing but a myth created by the syndicate—although the popular press had no notion that it was Holmes who finally, and at tremendous personal risk, brought the gang to its knees.</p>
			<p class="bt">On the night of this triumph (involving a complex trap devised by my friend which was far too convoluted for me to do it any justice in these memoirs), Holmes and I arrived back at Baker Street rain-drenched, muddied, bruised, exhausted, but fortunately unharmed. It had fallen to us to assist the Yard with rounding up the leaders of the Iron Hand in an effort perhaps exceeded only by my friend’s annihilation of Professor Moriarty’s network, and it was now close on three in the morning.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s elegant movements were dulled with the fatigue born of too many sleepless nights as we trudged indoors. Meanwhile, only residual nerves caused by my having stopped my friend’s skull from being crushed with a brass-headed club enabled me to keep my eyes open. The sleuth poured a pair of neat scotches, promptly eliminated his, and all but melted into his armchair.</p>
			<p class="bt">I began by sipping my drink, then saw the wisdom of his approach and finished it. “Holmes, you’re soaking the furniture.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have earned every liberty I take with it,” he intoned happily. “Was there ever such a repulsive band of villains as the ones just packed off in a fleet of Black Marias?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should hope not indeed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“God, but the energy I’ve spent over the last fortnight! Do you ever wonder, Watson, whether fires have primitive memories of sorts, and the embers of a coal engine after dragging a train up the Alps retain the echo of their exertions?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Eyeing him shrewdly, I decided that this was nothing worse than his typical rambling when he was past the point of mere depletion, and I allowed it to pass. He looked as if he were considering rising and then turned his coat collar up and settled into it like a feline creating a makeshift nest. It was a testament to his profound enervation that he seemed to have no intention of so much as washing.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, for heaven’s sake, at least try to make it as far as your bed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Impossible,” he murmured. “Quite entirely impossible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes, you haven’t even removed your boots.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He cracked a friendly eye at me, which drifted instantly shut after he had snugged an afghan around his shoulders, seeming content never to move again. “Good night, old fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Shaking my head fondly, I performed my own ablutions with rapidity, and I think fell asleep before my cheek so much as touched the pillow. After what seemed only an instant, I started awake again to find Holmes’s wiry fingers gripping my upper arm and candlelight glinting off his dark hair.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What on earth is the time?” I rasped, not without a hint of asperity.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Seven in the morning.” Holmes’s eyes shone hectically, and his exertions of late had imparted nigh-gaunt planes to his angular face.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Are you all right?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you mean after last night’s scuffle with the weighted club and the twenty-stone thug wielding it? Perfectly. Thanks to your good self, my brains remain quite intact. I should have missed them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We both should have, I imagine. Well, what’s wrong, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, you can be the most dedicated pessimist. Supposing something wonderful has happened, and I’m here to share the glad news?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Fighting a groan, I rolled onto my back, scrubbed a hand through my hair, and told myself sternly that the only course was military stoicism. “Impart to me this glad news.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The prospect of inaction is never a happy one for me, my dear Doctor, but especially not after so trying a matter as this Iron Hand affair. Swinging so far back and forth like a pendulum between vigor and sloth wreaks severest havoc on my mental processes. But we are in superb luck!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Are we indeed,” I managed with a notable lack of enthusiasm.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Inspector Hopkins is downstairs and it’s certainly a murder—Hopkins’s hands are the first thing to give him away when he’s agitated, and he hasn’t stopped fiddling with his cuffs these five minutes. I shall give you a quarter of an hour to refresh yourself and dress and then we must discover what’s the matter with the poor fellow. In the meanwhile, I’ll ring for tea.”</p>
			<p class="bt">With this announcement, he was off again like a hare. Dragging myself out of bed and shaving with the speed born of expertise at being rousted from slumber, I admonished myself that adequate sleep is never guaranteed to a man of medicine, and also that Stanley Hopkins so revered Sherlock Holmes that at least the problem could not be a trifling one.</p>
			<p class="bt">I found the pair of them smoking, Holmes carefully coiffed with his slippers tucked into his armchair and Hopkins on the settee with his spine as straight as if he were still wearing the blue coat and polished buttons of the roundsman. Our friend Hopkins, despite his own ingenuity, has never lost his veneration of the great detective’s methods—even had he not been rubbing his thumb over his opposite cuff as Holmes reported, his bright, almost zealous expression would have betrayed his excitement. He is a well-built, forgettably handsome fellow with a small divot in his chin, and would be quite unremarkable in appearance save for a pair of truly soulful and perceptive brown eyes.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My apologies for the earliness of the hour, gentlemen.” Hopkins’s lips tightened in sympathy. “I know well enough that you’ve both been clearing the streets of the Iron Hand, and everyone is bragging of last night’s triumph. You must be regularly done, but I know better than to delay over asking for help when the matter is as mystifying as this one.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, no, you did quite right, Inspector.” Holmes contemplatively flexed his left hand, where a bruise was beginning to show from its having dented a ruffian’s jaw. “We are always happy to help, are we not, Watson?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Delighted.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dear me! Have some tea, Doctor—Mrs. Hudson has just been and gone, and you’ll soon feel quite human again.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I doubted this severely but followed his instructions, finding them sound. Pouring for Hopkins, I remarked, “Holmes says ten to one it’s a murder. Nothing too disturbing before breakfast, I hope?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, Doctor, but the circumstances are enough to beat me. I’d have you both in a cab already, but the trains could hardly be stopped, and the tarp is insufficient considering the pedestrian traffic—we’ve been forced to move the body, but there are two constables guarding the scene.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hopkins, if you want to make any more of a topsy-turvy mess of this tale, supposing you hang upside-down like a bat as you tell it?” suggested Holmes with an angelic smile.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite right, sir.” Hopkins coughed abashedly. “Well, the first thing you’ll want to learn is that we’ve had no trouble identifying the dead man. The victim is one Mr. Forrester Hyde.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good Lord!” Holmes exclaimed. “Not the expert cracksman I landed in Wandsworth Prison over six years ago?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The very same, though it was a month before my promotion to detective.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, we’ve our own account, I trust?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Already feeling energized, I got to my feet as Holmes waved in the direction of my journals and his commonplace book. “Yes, I can lay my hands on it soon enough. Eighteen-ninety-four. You say Hyde has met his end, Inspector?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And a terribly strange end it was, to be sure, Dr. Watson.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’re certain it was a murder?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He had a fatal encounter with a bullet, and nothing indicates he could have done such a thing himself.” Inspector Hopkins smiled wryly.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s eyes narrowed. “And he was shot at a railway station, I take it, since you had to consider the sensibilities of a crowded area in the early hours of the morning and mentioned the impossibility of stopping the trains. A well-frequented line with a high concentration of the weekday laboring force who are the true heroes of the city, then. Which?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Hopkins chuckled appreciatively. “Wapping Station, the East London Railway.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, before we hear the inspector out, might you just refresh our recollections as to Hyde’s history?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I have it here.” Running my finger down the relevant page of Holmes’s index, I seated myself. “Ah, I remember. Forrester Hyde was a hardy, dashing sort, very well liked by the audacious types he ran with, especially the ladies—there’s a woodcut here from the day he was captured. Strong jaw, arrogant chin, dapper waxed moustache. For a cracksman, he certainly preferred not to keep his head down. He claimed to come from a coffee plantation fortune and patronize all manner of arts, not to mention specific artists of the fair sex. He wrote for several columns and was at one time a well-known theatrical critic who lived like a gentleman of leisure.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He gave that impression,” Holmes corrected with his pipe dangling from his fingers, “but he was a vile scoundrel who wormed his way into feminine confidences and thence into their safes. Once he had their trust, he would be allowed inside their lodgings under the pretext of false appointments, et cetera, and steal what he could find—judiciously, I might add, and never within the same immediate circle of acquaintances. In reality, he came from a none too respectable clan in the Leathermarket Gardens area, evinced the strongest talent for acting and mimicry I’ve ever seen, and used hotels when he wanted to give the impression of lavish spending. For the rest of the year, he rented a cheap flat on Lamb Walk.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just so! You caught him out over a detail in his clothing after being consulted by a ballerina of some renown, did you not?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes shrugged demurely. “One might own a few sets of expensive togs, even tie an array of cravat knots and keep one’s boots perfectly blacked, but if a chap lacks servants and a valet, I can discern it easily.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How so?” Hopkins inquired, as athirst as ever for tutelage.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, this rogue obviously saw to his own entire toilette every morning. It doesn’t matter whether your waistcoat is expensive supposing it hasn’t been brushed properly after washing, nor your shirtsleeves and trousers aired, for that matter. The roughness of the nap on all three items practically shrieked he was an impostor.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Excellent!” Hopkins exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Facile, surely. The ballerina, who shall remain nameless, already suspected him. Once I’d glimpsed him, I knew she was right. He’d have been caught long before then had he been greedier and the word spread—as it was, he needed only to keep up with the theatrical papers, submit his articles via mail, flatter the struggling with promise of good notices, and woo them in the language of flowers. The rest of the time he worked as a desultory construction engineer.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You followed him to his real home in Lamb Walk with Inspector Gregson and a warrant, but though you did find the ballerina’s sapphires hidden in the false bottom of a valise, you found nothing else,” I continued.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By George, that was wretchedly vexing!” Rousing, Holmes slapped his knee. “I blamed him for several more larcenous acts, but could tie him to no particular stonecutter or pawn shop, and so admitted defeat on those counts after a lengthy search. He likely sold a piece at a time and lived off the proceeds, never hoarding enough to incriminate himself, faked forced window latches and the like in other dwellings—anything so as not to arouse alarm.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But the dancer’s property was more than enough for a conviction on robbery charges, and . . . well, it seems that Hyde could have been released anytime during the past year,” I finished.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was Wednesday, gentlemen, and he was dead two days later,” Hopkins supplied.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, here we come to the meat of the matter.” Holmes’s torso gave an almost imperceptible twist of excitement in his armchair. “What happened between Wednesday and this morning, Inspector?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Forrester Hyde—who it appears kept to form and made every effort to charm his fellow prisoners—was released without much fuss back into the city, since as you say he was convicted on only a single count of theft. His whereabouts after he departed are unknown, but sometime during those two days, he attempted to return to his respectable profession of engineering. After a search, the body revealed a notebook containing information about contacting three foremen, though we all know how difficult it is to regain employment following incarceration. The other items on the deceased were quite immaterial—an inexpensive cigarette case, a key that presumably matched his new lodgings, and an initialed watch with a brass chain. His clothing is good quality, but secondhand. I found a jerry shop ticket in the pocket of the jacket.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very good thus far, friend Hopkins. And what befell him?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He was shot through the heart at close range with a small-caliber revolver that would have been easily concealed. There were powder burns on his coat. Hyde was able to crawl for a scant few feet, but we think he died in under a minute at most, and according to the blood that pooled, the body was not moved. This would have been sometime between midnight and two a.m., according to the coroner.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You claim he was killed at Wapping Station?” Holmes asked incredulously. “Surely not. No, no, it is too outlandish, even so late at night! We are expected to believe that a man was shot on the platform with no one the wiser?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By no means, sir!” Leaning forward, Hopkins clasped his hands together. “I expect you to believe that a man was shot beside the tracks in the <span class="charoverride3">middle of the Thames Tunnel,</span> and without a single witness.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ha!” Holmes crowed. The brightness of his eyes was crystalline with slightly manic sleep-deprivation, but gratifyingly clear, and avid with interest. “Pray continue your account, my good man.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Hopkins reported that on the previous evening, the 12:14 train experienced a brief stop in mid-tunnel due to someone’s having triggered the emergency brake. The conductors at once endeavored to ascertain whether there was a safety issue, but their search for the perpetrator was inconclusive, and—after every precaution had been taken—the train continued on its way again.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely the method if not the motive is obvious, then,” Holmes argued. “As to what Hyde was doing precisely, we must yet determine, but a fatal altercation must have taken place during the time the train was stopped, and the body was thrown from between two cars to the edge of the tracks. All is coal smoke and foulness as the engine passes under the Thames, and where decades ago it was packed with fashionable promenaders and fancy goods markets, now you can hardly see your hand before your face while still under the archway. Even a careful conductor could easily have missed spotting Hyde where he lay.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Agreed. Well, in part. No blood was found in or between any of the cars afterward, however. And the marks in the mud are most uncanny. Foot impressions begin about five feet from where we found the body and end in a pool of his blood, but there are no deeper gouges or splatters to indicate he fell from the train. In fact, signs appear to suggest that he materialized within the tunnel.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hopkins,” Holmes said in a tone of such exquisite patience that his irritation could not have been clearer, “we have more than once conducted this discussion, and I remain more inclined to believe that <span class="charoverride3">you</span> cannot read visible footprints than that criminals can fly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But you shall see for yourself that the dirt and soot are clear as day, Mr. Holmes! And anyhow, there was no train ticket on the body.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Now you sound like one of Watson’s lurid <span class="charoverride3">Strand </span>fabrications.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Smiling, I said judiciously, “If the evidence at hand seems too daunting, Holmes, another few hours’ sleep would not go amiss.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes waved away this suggestion as if it were preposterous. “No, no, I shall have a look, of course. There is an explanation for everything under the sun.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The body is at the morgue en route to Wapping.” Hopkins set down his teacup. “We’ll stop there, with your permission, and then continue on to Wapping Station. I’ve good men standing watch, and we need not fear they’ll displace anything.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes and I went for our coats and boots, which thankfully had dried somewhat. “In that case, I am in your hands, Inspector Hopkins,” Holmes announced.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just wait until you see the remains, sir. I quite shrink from thinking of them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of a bullet wound?” Holmes asked in visible bafflement.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, of the other signs, which I shan’t report lest I bias your judgment,” Hopkins said with a shiver. “There’s something worse afoot here than a simple murder, that I can promise you.”</p>
			<p class="btspace">Deadhouses, no matter how well maintained, always excrete an aroma of inevitability, that commingled scent of metal and decay that reminds you how long some elements can outlive others, and how short a time it may be before your own tenuous thread is snapped. This smell festers much more strongly in the summer months, but was present nevertheless as we walked into the stone morgue, approaching a table where a body lay under a sheet. When Hopkins pulled back the covering, Holmes’s high forehead knit in consternation, and I admit I was myself taken aback. While I recognized an older, gaunter version of Forrester Hyde—his squarely masculine head and even features, now of course minus the ostentatious facial hair—my eyes were by no means drawn to his face.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whatever can have caused these abrasions?” the detective murmured.</p>
			<p class="bt">“That’s what plagues me too, Mr. Holmes,” Hopkins assented. “Dr. Watson, you’d better have a look.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I leaned down over the source of the fuss as Holmes cast his eyes over the rest of the body. The bullet wound was straightforward in the extreme—a neat, puckered hole now wiped clean of gore. Much more disconcerting were the victim’s hands: his fingertips were bruised and scraped, his nails raggedly torn away, even the edges of his thumbs having bled their share before he was killed. Had he dipped his hands within a sausage grinder and yanked them out again, he could hardly have done more damage.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Any conclusions?” Holmes inquired, his attention still fixed on the body’s shins and ankles.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve one comparison, but I’m afraid it confuses rather than illuminates matters,” I admitted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why so?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, the only time I’ve ever seen anything like this, there was a fire that had broken out in a derelict building, and very shortly thereafter the doorway was heaped with rubble. Men and women clawing for an egress made such marks upon their hands universally. The ones who survived, anyhow, and before the firemen tore the grating from a window.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Nodding, Holmes lifted the left hand as if cradling exquisitely delicate porcelain. “I would have said the same, Doctor. It is very unlikely these are anything but self-inflicted. There is no torture I can think of that batters phalanges in this haphazard manner. And had he been trying to climb something, his knees would be equally damaged. No—he was trying to escape from somewhere.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just as I feared, then,” Inspector Hopkins lamented. “As Dr. Watson says, this only adds to the confusion.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes replaced the appendage with extraordinary care. I noted that his movements, though steady, were still more languid than usual, and determined that I had better force some food into the man before he dropped in the street.</p>
			<p class="bt">“On the contrary,” said he. “It is an uncommon fact; therefore it is a helpful one. One uncommon fact can potentially be worth twenty of your boot prints, bullet shells, or cigar stubs. So Hyde was likely captured—or at least <span class="charoverride3">trapped</span>—shortly after having been released from prison. Anyone could have discovered the date of his parole, but he would have lost his lodgings years beforehand. His destination must have been unknown to any save close confederates. Therefore he was either followed after leaving Wandsworth, or betrayed by one of those trusted individuals, as the odds are astronomically against these injuries being coincidental.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But what can we do?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Might you wire the warden for me and find out whether he received any regular correspondence there?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, that’s the ticket! In a trice, Mr. Holmes. I’ll just write it out, and then we’ll be en route to Wapping Station.” Hopkins turned on his heel, clattered up the stairs, and left Holmes and me standing with puzzled brows on either side of a most peculiar corpse.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Did you find anything else?” I inquired.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nothing to signify. He had a bad knee and favored it, likely due to an old insult he sustained as a convict. Or else, it is not outside the realm of possibility that it was a tennis injury. Who can say? We are through here.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Duly, I replaced the sheet. “We are going to stop for a sandwich, Holmes. At the very least, toasted cheese.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you know, Watson, I never liked Forrester Hyde,” he reflected with a gaze lost in the mists of time. “Granted, he never made much of himself as a criminal genius, which already disposes me against him, but I recall he had a mean, vengeful streak, and a still thicker stripe of unchecked rage. Such men all too often prey upon the opposite gender and, rather than retaining any scrap of chivalry by simply going in for robbery or embezzlement at a faceless business, exploit women because they fear no revenge from such victims whose positions are already tenuous. He was no exception. When we appeared in court and he spied the ballerina who was his downfall, he spat at her despite the fact she was a galaxy away, up in the gallery. You remember her, I suppose, despite the passage of years?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Miss Elizabeth Gayle,” I readily answered. “Though I know her to have been very low at the time—and who would not have been, betrayed as she was—despite her melancholy she could not seem to repress sudden flashes of humor. Her wardrobe entirely lacked the ostentation favored by so many of her profession; she preferred cleanly draped lines and dark fabrics, though nothing she wore was morbid or plain in the slightest. As pale and slender as a birch tree, a shimmering configuration of light brown hair, large and luminous eyes, and a serenely sad countenance livened by a small, delightfully puckish mouth. She was quite riveting. Yes, of course I recall her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend, pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose in satirical despair, made to follow Hopkins.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I say, Holmes, I was not in jest when I remarked we must consume a little sustenance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come along, my dear Watson. We must have all our wits about us, or at least <span class="charoverride3">I </span>must. Your own are rather more dispensable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">In vain did I remonstrate and in vain reason with the man until finally, abandoning hope, I consumed the two apples I’d purchased from a street urchin, and we rejoined Hopkins to survey the scene of the crime.</p>
			<p class="btspace">It is difficult not to envy those who were able to enjoy the Thames Tunnel at the apex of its beauty: the sheer marvel of its craftsmanship; the otherworldly pathway beneath the river itself; the polished marble steps leading under the turgid waters; the blue and white mosaic floor; the brilliant glow of the gas lamps; the opulently dressed pleasure-seekers stopping to have their fortunes told and to listen to the melody of the great echoing organ. The sight must surely have been a wonder in its time, but those days are long past. Now, just as my friend had mentioned, the Thames Tunnel is a soot-encrusted chute connecting Wapping with the South London Line, transporting cargo and weary-eyed passengers back and forth with none of the attendant awe associated with speeding through a corridor surrounded by a titanic volume of water. For what, after all, is there to see save fellow laborers with faces like crumpled newsprint? Or if one chooses the window as a vista, all-enveloping darkness until one reaches the opposite station?</p>
			<p class="bt">The air was foul and thick with grit as we stepped onto the platform from the stairway. Four uniformed constables guarded Wapping Station, and we had been promised by Hopkins that the same configuration was repeated on the other end of the tunnel—one set of two patrolmen on each side of the platform—for a total of eight officers. No one, he vowed with such fervor that Holmes hid a laugh in an abrupt cough, could possibly have disturbed the integrity of the footmarks. In a dignified yet still transparent glow of pride, Hopkins ordered yet another set of four policemen to make certain that the trains had been stopped, and to light their brightest bulls-eye lanterns for the examination of the evidence.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thank God you’re here, Doctor,” said Holmes under his breath.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am always glad to help, but what can you mean?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If friend Hopkins grows any more stimulated, I fear for his heart despite his relative youth and vigor. Just think of the strain.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Smothering a smile as Hopkins informed us that all was in readiness was an arduous task, but I managed it. We followed after the constables, descended a set of iron steps for the railway workmen down to the tracks, and then stopped as Holmes whisked himself into place before the group.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Everyone take the utmost care to step only on the railroad ties, on the gauge side and not the field side, if you please!” he called out, his ringing voice weirdly diminished in the foulness of the atmosphere. “Granted, our quarry may have done the same, but it takes a bold fellow indeed to walk in mid-track when the trains have not been stopped. A quarter hour of your time, and we shall return triumphant having escaped the underworld!”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes—who could be very popular with the roundsmen when he wanted something from them—received applause and cries of “Hear, hear!” for this exhortation from the Yarders, while I shook my head in undisguised worriment. His behavior was not at all out of character, but his eyes gleamed quicksilver-bright and his gestures grew more expansive by the minute. My iron-willed friend has more than once driven himself directly into loss of consciousness due to lack of the most basic human maintenance; this was a spectacle I desired specifically to avoid.</p>
			<p class="bt">As we walked along the ties, the light grew dimmer and the air thicker until the lanterns were of scant use. Still, it was no worse than an ordinary London Particular, and one by one we began tying our scarves round our faces to keep out the hovering charcoal.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Here we are, Mr. Holmes!” Hopkins, who walked alongside my friend in the lead, whistled grandly to signal the halt of the party. “Every­one with a lantern, do as Mr. Holmes and I bid you, and this will go at first-rate speed. Mr. Holmes, allow me to present to you the murder site!”</p>
			<p class="bt">We could barely see one another, but I could not miss the humorous flash of my friend’s eyes as he glanced at me, and even in the gloom I was forced to bend and—ostensibly—clear the foul atmosphere from my lungs.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The footmarks begin here.” I could hear Hopkins’s familiar voice but could see nothing from my position, so I planted my hands in my pockets and followed the line of the light as it hazily illuminated the inspector’s back and Holmes’s profile as it paid Hopkins’s account the most minute attention. “And here they are the most concentrated. Much is explained if, as you said, he traveled via the ties and then leapt over to the margin, as indeed much is explained if he descended on foot—still alive, though mortally injured—from the stopped train. Both hypotheses present serious difficulties. But as you can see, he has faced in a number of directions just here, where the ground is all but churned, and then we shift to the signs of a man crawling on hand and knee, blood dripping from his waistcoat. Can you see them?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, they are unmistakable,” said Holmes.</p>
			<p class="bt">A jolt coursed through me at his tone. Sherlock Holmes had noticed something already, had transformed from a distant, ironical man into a sleek panther crouched in a cover of spreading foliage, a predator alert, as it stalks its natural prey, to the merest quiver of a leaf.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hyde crawls for about as far as you might expect from the severity of the wound,” Hopkins continued, “and the wider puddle here is where he expired.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Indeed, I gathered as much. And you are right to say that nothing indicates he landed here after having been expelled from between cars. However, do you not, Hopkins, find the details of this jumble of initial marks rather indicative?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“In what way?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, I admit that I may be very fanciful, but the weight balance of some of these prints seems to me unusual. Note that just there he seems to be moving forward—you’ll perceive a slightly deeper depression between one foot and the other, which confirms a superfluous observation I made in the morgue regarding a knee injury—but in any case, those indentations are quite different from these, for example, when he staggers back. Do they suggest anything to your ample acumen?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes!” the young inspector exclaimed. “Good heavens, you’re right, Mr. Holmes, you must be! My cap is off to you already, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The detective paused. “What am I right about, if I may beg the extreme honor of knowing my own mind?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He was reeling to and fro, Mr. Holmes, from the shock and the pain of it—first on his toes and then on his heels, and from the very beginning! Therefore we can eliminate the notion that he entered via either of the stations. The murderer stopped the train, shot Hyde before the squeal of the brakes and the clatter of the tracks would cease to cover the noise, and then pushed the still-living Hyde from between the cars, thereby making a masterful getaway. Then the killer mopped up any traces of blood onboard before we were alerted. Have I got the right end?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, I grant that you are at least partially correct, though I admit I was thinking of something rather more outlandish regarding one aspect of that theory. Tut-tut, never mind—my trifling whims get the better of me from time to time, you understand.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You might share your idea anyhow, sir. I am all attention.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I certainly will, if it comes to anything. You may assist in that regard, as a matter of fact.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“At your service, Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Constable! Shine your lantern so that I can make a note on my cuff, will you? Many thanks. Now, Hopkins, give me the names of the engineers Hyde wrote down and presumably contacted in search of employment, please. I shall be indebted.”</p>
			<p class="bt">A few polite murmurs broke out as we shifted our feet and waited for the pair to complete this transaction. When they had finished, my friend thanked the mystified inspector and turned back to the group.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quick march, lads!” he cried. “This is no atmosphere in which to linger. I’ve had drafts of shag that were cleaner—onward and upward, and Hopkins, feel free to disband the guards. Oh, but just arrange for a photograph to be taken of the footmarks first! Would that inconvenience you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I—not at all,” our friend managed. “You heard Mr. Holmes, gentlemen! Back to the station and I’ll assign a pair of you to photograph the scene.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Upon regaining the platform, Holmes made our swift goodbyes and strode for the stairs, vaulting up them as if the devil were in pursuit. When we reached the near-blinding daylight aboveground, I registered with chagrin that Holmes’s zealous gaze had turned posi­tively feverish.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s the nearest restaurant possible for us, and there you shall tell me about your findings,” I announced.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There isn’t time, Watson.” Already casting about for a cab, he spied one and gestured with his stick to the driver. “By all means, refresh yourself. I can suggest nothing better, for I’ve a tedious hour or two ahead you needn’t assist me over, and so I shall meet you back at Baker Street. Enjoy your meal, my good man. I’ll have a cup of coffee at my destination.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Which is?” I demanded helplessly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Scotland Yard.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But why?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“To follow a hunch.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, you are a person, not an automaton, and therefore you require sufficient nourishment to remain alive in order to follow hunches.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, your intentions are doubtless as pure as the shores of Eden, but I am so tired that should I so much as ingest a biscuit, I would be unable to lift a finger for forty-eight hours. Wish me luck!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Best of luck, but Holmes, what did you see on the tracks?”</p>
			<p class="bt">He turned back as he stepped upon the rail, every vein aquiver with the intoxication of the chase. “Hopkins has always been dismal with footprints—you recall the business of Black Peter, and that matter over the Russian woman’s pince-nez was even worse. I do not blame him for being blind to the only possible conclusion in this case, however, for it is rather incredible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And it comprises?” I managed to keep the frustration from my tone only with severest effort.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have seen a great many queer tracks in my time,” Holmes said, leaning out the hansom’s window at a jaunty angle after he had slammed it shut. “But even I have never before seen a set that clearly indicated the party had emerged from a solid brick wall. Great Scotland Yard, driver! And quickly!”</p>
			<p class="btspace">Needless to say, I returned home and partook of lunch provided by Mrs. Hudson with a gnawing anxiety in my belly. Surely Holmes could not be serious in his suggestion that Hyde had essentially materialized in a tunnel only to be shot to death, and my fellow lodger’s relentless energy was beginning to verge upon a frenzy I had seen more than once prior and grown to dread. After a bowl of lamb stew had been eradicated, though, I began to feel more optimism. Never had I heard that tone of giddy secrecy in Holmes’s voice save when he was convinced beyond a doubt. So I took occupation of the settee, with a pillow under my head and a novel propped upon my chest, intending to await his return.</p>
			<p class="bt">When the sitting room door flew open with a bang, the shadows had made significant advances, the expiring sun having commenced a tactical retreat. My eyes flew open as Holmes swept into the room, muttering of notions too soft to catch and too abstruse to comprehend anyhow, more than likely.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Apologies, Holmes, I must have drifted off while waiting for you. What did you discover?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It has to be right, it <span class="charoverride3">has</span> to be right,” he hissed, striking his palm with his fist. “Oh, the odds are a thousand to one in my favor, but as to proving it, I cannot work <span class="charoverride3">miracles</span>!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens! Sit down and explain, if you are willing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes did sit, the bags under his eyes beginning to be lightly etched with lavender. “Watson, do you know how valuable you are to me as a sounding board?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whatever I can do, including nothing at all, I shall gladly attempt.” Pouring a small pair of whiskeys, I passed one to him and took my accustomed chair.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are the best of confidants, my friend. You neither know the point I am about to make nor rush me in arriving there. It’s transcendentally clarifying.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You flatter me unnecessarily.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, no, you are like the transparent glass which nevertheless focuses the beams emanating from the lighthouse, you are—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Let us leave the compliments out of it, since you have urgent news.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes, sitting with his elbow propped upon the chair arm, blew a breath through his teeth. “We must go back a step or two. I’ve already reminded you that I never liked Forrester Hyde, but you will also remember how chafed I was to pin him on only one instance of theft, since we could prove no other possession of stolen property. That was singular. I had thought him frugal, and wise to make few waves—what a dunce I was! You really ought to have mentioned that I was not paying the problem its full attention, my dear Watson.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I fail to grasp your meaning, for it is obscure in the extreme.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He surged forward in his chair, fanning long fingers. “When a man finds a stirring vocation at which he excels, Watson, what does he do? Does he hide his talent and return to the gutter? Does he commit himself to it piecemeal, neglect it for weeks at a time in favor of physical drudgery?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No.” I drew the word out, seeing his point. “No, he practices it, and with a will.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, he does!” Holmes cried. He thrust three sheets of foolscap at me, and I took them. “Hyde contacted this trio the instant he was released from prison—Richard Black, Davy Burntree, and Stephen McKay. Take a look at my notes from the Yard’s files this afternoon, and from the city’s bureau of records, and see what you make of it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend’s handwriting was generally clear though steeply sloping, but his physical enervation had rendered it almost illegible. Thus it took me nearly a minute’s perusal of the three scribbled biographies before the pattern blazed to life before my eyes.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you mean to tell me that <span class="charoverride3">all three</span> of these men worked as engineers on the Thames Tunnel when it was converted from a pedestrian pleasure walk into an operative railway line, and alongside Forrester Hyde, and ten years before we ever encountered him?” I exclaimed. “Holmes, this—I cannot think what this means. Obviously, it changes everything, but in what manner? Were you serious when you said—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, every ounce of my being was serious, Doctor. Forrester Hyde walked out of that brick wall with an eager—not to say panicked, though I think it a fair assessment based on the depth of the mud ­indentation—gait, and then met his end. On the surface, this seems impossible, so we must reexamine our facts and see if we have recorded any amiss, which errors might be tripping up our thought processes. We know that he died very soon after his release, implying if not presupposing that unfinished business plagued him. We know that he robbed other women besides Miss Elizabeth Gayle, and that I identified neither fences nor stonecutters with whom he worked. We know that he worked as a construction engineer when he was not fleecing female artists out of their tangible valuables in exchange for soon-to-be-useless reviews. Taking into account that I never found his hoard, and that I know for a fact he emerged from a solid wall—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes!” I cried. “Yes, yes, I see your thoughts.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I had no doubt that you would, eventually.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Somehow he must have stashed his ill-gotten gains in a secret chamber within the tunnel. Just a moment, though—you said that it seemed as if he emerged from the wall itself, but you found no tracks leading there. Even supposing he did build a hidden room, that’s impossible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By no means. A clever pack rat would surely create multiple entrances, particularly bearing in mind that the one we know about is so inherently perilous owing to the active trains. The balance is strongly in favor of another’s existence.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very well, that explains the footprints. But the rest is confused and haphazard, at least so far as I can make out.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I do not find it so very esoteric.” Holmes’s voice had slowed to a logician’s drone. (I surmised this was due to the fact that he was finally seated, and at home, and therefore inclined to collapse.) “Step by step, it plays out in this manner: suppose that Forrester Hyde, after discovering his native oeuvre, sought local allies to assist him in building an impenetrable vault—impenetrable because no one save his associates knew it was there at all, lodged between the decorative interior wall and the much more formidable supporting structure. He could not have accomplished this without confidants. I surmise that he paid them handsomely for assisting him, but told them that the secret room had another purpose entirely, else he would have been forced to share the bounty for the remainder of his larcenous career. An eccentric’s study, a place for his most vile illicit assignations . . . Forrester Hyde could convince people of practically anything, and when enough money enters into the equation, securing the silence of others isn’t so very difficult.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, that follows. London is full of whimsical Bohemians. Your own brother founded the Diogenes Club, for no purpose other than to avoid friendly communication.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The example is apt.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why should he have sought these men out upon his release, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, that is a more subtle point, but I am near certain of it. Once I had arrested him, if his erstwhile colleagues happened to catch wind of his incarceration, they might easily have concluded his lair had been intended for other purposes and raided it accordingly. But supposing they were still employed as foremen, it would be highly unlikely that they had made off with a fortune, and his cache could be assumed intact. Is that reasoning clear?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It seems sound enough to me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very good. Now allow me to suggest a purely hypothetical scenario to you—and you realize that I would do so before no one else with so few clues to work with: Forrester Hyde has no train ticket on his person because he needs none. He accesses the entrance to the vault within the Thames Tunnel—from where originally we cannot say, but I posit from a hidden door on one of the passenger platforms—with every intention of collecting his bounty and escaping by retracing his steps. Something happens in the interim, however, an unforeseen threat, which forces him to flee onto the tracks. To no avail, of course, since his mortal foe proved to be whichever man pulled the brakes on the Wapping-bound train. It smacks of conspiracy on the part of Black, Burntree, and McKay, does it not?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, but enacted by which of them? And for the purpose of robbery, or the still more sinister intent of ending his life?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I confess it freely, Watson: I haven’t the slightest idea.” Holmes appeared almost comically frustrated by this confession, draping himself over his chair as if he were as boneless as an ulster carelessly tossed there. “We know where he was killed, and therefore that he was forced to exit via the tunnel for reasons which are still obscure to us. But he found that the passage of time had been his enemy. He was fully capable of unlocking the alternative egress, presumably, but what is an unlocked door in a brick wall when ravaged by urban decay? And what would happen next, if he refused to go out the way he came in?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“His fingers!” Shaking my head, I pictured it all too easily. “Holmes, you know already that you are a genius, but I hereby affirm it for the thousandth time. He had not accounted for natural processes and cracks plugged tight with grit and ash. Fighting the weight of the door, he found himself captured by a mere room, doubtless with some peril at his heels. Desperate to escape, he eventually clawed his way out—which caused the unexplained injuries we saw at the morgue.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So you are of a mind with me, then,” Holmes said softly, staring at the carpet as if all of life’s mysteries could be solved there. “When he reached the exit onto the field side of the tracks, he stumbled out in his eagerness. Shifting, he saw the light of an oncoming train. It is what happened afterward that we must determine, and that task seems to me nigh-impossible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, consider our options. Any unknown crony of Hyde’s could conceivably have pursued him from Wapping. More likely, considering the fact he had recently corresponded with them, any combination of his three former coworkers could have committed this deed, and secured alibis, and lied about their doings thereafter. How can I build a case destined to fall apart at the seams? I have a body, known associates, and one hopes a photograph of some very strange footprints. We can investigate the hiding place from the tunnel side as well, knowing whence he emerged. Otherwise, the culprit is virtually untraceable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes looked so dejected that I hardly knew how to answer him. However, within the next ten minutes of my puttering about refreshing tea and uselessly staring out the window, a telegram arrived. I recall with fondness the pale silvered tint of the overcast light in our sitting room, the quick breath my friend took through his nose as he read the missive.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Is it bad news?” I ventured.</p>
			<p class="bt">“On the contrary.” Holmes’s eyes flashed up to mine. “My suggestion to Hopkins has borne fruit: Forrester Hyde did have one steady correspondent when he was in prison. I cannot help thinking that same person might shed some light on this matter.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But who was it, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Elizabeth Gayle.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My God.” Absorbing this signal development, I quickly recovered. “Are we to pay her a visit?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can suggest nothing better to do.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Where does she live, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hay’s Mews, Mayfair.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That’s only a hansom ride away. Holmes, why should a woman who had been so wronged by Forrester Hyde write to him in jail? She seemed a highly sensitive soul, as an artist, but hardly an impractical one, and she sought us out in the first place, after all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There exist many reasons for such erratic behavior, ranging from complete delusion to the birth of a secret child fathered by Hyde.” He darted his thin arms into his jacket and adopted a contemplative look. “Or some other motive as yet unknown. I have given up attempting to plumb the depths of the female psyche, Watson. It is not unlike contemplating infinity—a worthy, even a spiritual meditation, destined from the beginning to fail entirely.”</p>
			<p class="btspace">I have already described Elizabeth Gayle, and therefore I will not repeat myself regarding her willow-thin poise or her regretful smile except to say that the years had treated her with kindness. Her dark honey-colored hair was done up in Bohemian braids, and she wore a tasseled maroon shawl over a charcoal traveling costume with draped bell sleeves. We discovered her in the act of hurriedly packing a small case, and my heart seized at the sight, because it meant that my friend Sherlock Holmes was right—surely, she knew a great deal about this dire business to move with such agitation, for her limbs as I remembered them had been svelte and graceful. She was escaping a spare, clean room papered with an ivy pattern, and her eyes when she met ours were red-veined and weary.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Miss Gayle, please forgive the intrusion and grant me the courtesy of speaking with you,” Holmes attempted, removing his hat deferentially.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes! Why, it is you, and after all this time! What are you doing here?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That remains to be determined. Do sit down, for I fear that you are under some strain.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Miss Gayle sank into an armchair, limbs quivering. “That is all too true, I fear. Mr. Holmes, before you begin to question me—for I see that question me you must, and I recall your tenacity of will with great admiration—please allow me to make my own statement, for it would save us precious minutes and as you can see, I am in a terrible rush. I vow to tell you all—in fact, I firmly believe I owe it to you, and I always pay my debts in full—but I beg of you to let me speak my own story rather than submit to an interrogation, however genteel. There is much that you do not know. And as it will be painful to report, I should prefer to begin at once.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A fair request, and one I do not begrudge you in the slightest,” Holmes allowed. “In your own time, then.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Seating ourselves after she gestured to a rather threadbare sofa, we watched her take a few agitated breaths. Miss Gayle adjusted the shawl draped over her shoulders, finally shaking her head as if in tragic amusement before beginning her account.</p>
			<p class="bt">“First, you are under a misapprehension as to my name. Professionally, it is Elizabeth Gayle, but legally, that is not the case.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What in fact is your name, if you please to tell us?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mrs. Forrester Hyde,” she whispered.</p>
			<p class="bt">At our shocked expressions, she actually smiled. “From the beginning, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Please,” Holmes assented, rapt.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You have met the man, so I will not embark upon the subject of his charm, but it was mesmerizing. When he introduced himself to me, it was as he did to so many others: as an urbane man of the world—confident, casually radiating luck. Forrester seemed somehow more <span class="charoverride3">alive</span> than anyone around him, as if the streets were filled with inked illustrations of other men and he was the only person present in the actual flesh. We were wedded in secret, which he claimed would serve both our careers, because I would be free to socialize with artists and freethinkers and his praise of my skills could not be accused of bias. What a ripe fool I was then! His hotel was often our home, and sometimes my digs—modest, but nevertheless much grander than what you see now—were where we made our partial life together. He claimed to travel a great deal, and I never dreamed he had another set of London lodgings until, long suspecting him guilty of affairs, I followed him there and discovered what manner of man my husband truly was.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Forrester actively hated women, Mr. Holmes, with a venom that went far beyond some men’s typically callous treatment. Instead of being ashamed that I had learned about his double life, he boasted to me—of his conquests, his sneak-thievery, his cleverness in building the hidden chamber in the Thames Tunnel, the impossibility of my divorcing him, and the power he had over me as a critic. He seemed to gorge himself on my sorrow. It may sound asinine to you gentlemen, but after my marriage exploded before my eyes, my own idiocy in having been duped by a persuasive blackguard was such a source of embarrassment that I came to think of dancing as the only love I had left in my bleak life—and my spirits could not bear the idea of losing my art as well over a vengeful review. Thus, initially I chose to do nothing. Claiming I could love only him, I continued to play the part of a wronged wife—and my husband was so cruel and self-obsessed, it saved my career.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You ought never to have been forced to make such a choice,” I could not help declaring.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Granted—but I was, nevertheless. That being said, I knew of his crimes against others like me, and could not rest until this execrable man’s capacity for harm was nullified. The sapphires you found in the hidden compartment in Forrester’s bag did indeed belong to me, Mr Holmes. But you never suspected that I had planted them there.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You framed a robber and a cad with evidence of thievery?” Holmes confirmed with what could only be called admiration. “His behavior toward you at the trial was extraordinarily vicious, but now his rage is much more explicable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The betrayal of a dishonest brute involves more courage than cowardice, Miss Gayle,” I added with a will.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I cannot presume to censure you for that action, which temporarily rid London of a blight, but frankly the matter I came to see you about is a far more urgent one, and one you have not yet touched upon,” Holmes continued. “How came you to be corresponding with your estranged spouse, and how came he to be shot by an assassin aboard a stopped Wapping-bound train? You cannot deny, in light of what seems a hasty departure from these lodgings, that you have been somehow involved.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Miss Gayle paled, but pressed on. “No, I cannot, and you shall have the whole truth out of me, Mr. Holmes. I resumed my relationship with Forrester for my own purposes owing to the fact that his last spiteful action before the bars shut upon him was to pen a scathing review of my performance in a new production of <span class="charoverride3">The Talisman.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Knowing that ballet was your passion as well as your livelihood, a cruel vengeance indeed,” Holmes replied gravely.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was.” She tilted her head a little, wincing as she recalled it. “I needed money; as you can see, I still do. Having convinced him before that I was obsessed with him, I thought that I might convince him I was desperately sorry, and that way retain some semblance of respectable living. It worked, to a point. Forrester readily believed me pathetic enough to adore him utterly, and so the practice of writing letters proved no obstacle—but as to the subject discussed? Not one penny did he send me, gentlemen. He thought of nothing from prison save retrieving his hoard. He was obsessed as much with the secret chamber as the treasure within, I think, a weeping dragon forcibly separated from its mountain of gold. When he was released, he even wrote to the engineers who had helped him build it, terrified he should discover one of them had abandoned London for the South of France, suddenly wealthy. None had, of course. They were callow, biddable creatures, and they lacked the key to its elaborate lock. As did I.”</p>
			<p class="bt">A creeping sensation brushed icy fingers along my shoulders just as Holmes’s expression shifted, the fines lines around his eyes deepening suddenly in concentration.</p>
			<p class="bt">Miss Elizabeth Gayle—for so I will always think of her—smiled her melancholy smile once more, but this time it possessed teeth that could rend.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Forrester was likewise a callow, biddable creature. Oh, yes, I did it, Mr. Holmes,” she said in a muted but matter-of-fact voice. “It was not enough anymore—the light jail sentence, the imminent ­release—not when he vented all his impotent rage in that stone-walled hell by continuing to torment me. Forrester was wise enough to tell me nothing of where the key was concealed, but he told me everything else I needed to know—about his paranoia; about Black, Burntree, and McKay.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What on earth have you done, Miss Gayle?” I breathed when Holmes sat, silent as a statue.</p>
			<p class="bt">“She wrote to the engineers herself,” my friend replied mechanically, breaking from his reverie. “She told them to trail her husband upon his release—very carefully, so as to gain entrance to the room in the Thames Tunnel after Hyde led them there, carrying the only key. But she knew another entrance existed. And so she took precautions, and bought a ticket for a commuter train to Wapping.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very good, Mr. Holmes,” she said approvingly. “Any outcome would have satisfied me—had the engineers stolen the bounty, I should simply have stolen it back from them. As it was, Forrester managed to lock the upper door on his confederates and was forced to flee via the tracks. The damage done to the tunnel exit nearly undid me, but he escaped at the last possible moment, hands bloodied, bag in hand. This I snatched from him as he attempted to board, and I rid England of an ugly presence. So much was happening—the shouts of the conductors, the bangs and clanks of the steam engine as the train idled—that no one noticed a tiny gunshot from a weapon wrapped in thick wool. The jewelry is no longer in my possession, Mr. Holmes—a series of packages has been delivered, and the valuables have been returned to their rightful owners, so far as I could determine them at this late date. I have kept nothing for myself except this.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Standing, she removed a small revolver from a pocket hidden within the folds of her skirts.</p>
			<p class="bt">I started, and Holmes raised a palm in undisguised alarm.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I know better than to imagine you will not make use of that weapon if you feel the need, madam,” he attempted, “but I promise you there are many preferable alternatives.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But there aren’t, are there? Only force remains, at the end. You cannot condone a premeditated murder, and I cannot ask you to betray your consciences,” she whispered with a harrowed half-smile. “I can incapacitate the pair of you as easily as I can kill you, but you have been of invaluable service to me in the past—my heart is light when I think of Forrester’s death, on behalf of many others as well as myself, but hurting either of you would grieve me. Now, I am lifting this valise and going to the train station. If you try to stop me, it will go painfully for you both, though I should not dream of faulting you for setting the police on my trail afterward. Au revoir,<span class="charoverride3"> </span>Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. To say ‘Thank you’ seems inadequate—and still, I humbly thank you both for the part you have paid in freeing us all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She departed with her usual floating step, a black cloak over her arm, gently shutting the door. We had sat there dumbstruck for some few seconds before Holmes mentioned, “I suppose we ought to pursue her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Neither of us stood, Holmes matching his hands together in prayerful-looking contemplation.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, since Mrs. Hyde was my original client when I was introduced to this sordid affair years ago—albeit under false pretenses, granted—and now Hopkins has engaged me, do you think I am facing a conflict of interest?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Judiciously, I considered. “That is possible, but when your original client embarks upon vigilante justice which ends in bloodshed, as a sworn defender of the law you must reconsider your position.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, of course.” He shrugged, eyes half-lidded and bloodshot, the reaction already overtaking him now the mystery had been solved. “But on the other hand, do you admit that as an independent contractor, I’ve the right accorded any private citizen not to be shot at in the course of my workday?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why, naturally. You are employed neither by the Yard nor in any military or guardsman capacity. You are merely a consultant.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And while you are former military, one could make the argument you are here in the service of literature, not crime-solving. I should not like to see you wounded over an art form.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That is very kind of you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Perhaps a minute later, after checking his watch, Holmes rose rather lurchingly to his feet. “Don’t dawdle so dreadfully, my dear Watson, not when there’s a murderess to run to ground. We must seek out friend Hopkins and enlighten him as to this case’s most signal features of interest.”</p>
			<p class="bt">While Sherlock Holmes did not shirk in his clear duty to inform Inspector Hopkins of all that had taken place, neither did he appear to make any great haste over doing so, for following this desultory exchange, we took our time in finding a cab. Whether this laxity was due to his natural inclination to sympathize with the killer rather than the deceased or to his being on the verge of physical collapse, I could not say. But by the time we found the hidden entrance to the Thames Tunnel, masked behind a staircase on one of the platforms, my friend was swaying to the point that he had need of my elbow for support, and Mrs. Hyde, née Gayle, had vanished entirely. No doubt Hopkins fulfilled all his obligations to the letter, and her ingenuity rather than any fault of the good inspector accounted for her escape.</p>
			<p class="bt">Readers of the society columns may recall a startling announcement from that selfsame date when Mr. Sherlock Holmes, upon descending from a hansom delivering us back to Baker Street, fainted dead away in the road. As I have mentioned in the account titled “The Norwood Builder,” this had happened upon no fewer than four occasions previously, although never before in public. I got him indoors, where smelling salts and brandy and hot broth were administered; but when all is said and done, I am grateful regarding the open-air setting in which this embarrassing predicament occurred. The fact it was well publicized gives me every cause to hope that similar disasters can be entirely prevented in future.</p>
