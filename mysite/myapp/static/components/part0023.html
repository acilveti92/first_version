The building, called “the College,” was actually Mossad headquarters. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was welcomed by the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em>, Meir Dagan, when he came out of the second car. A short while earlier, Netanyahu had extended Dagan’s appointment by another year.</p><p id="p1526" class="text-indent">Dagan and the Mossad heads felt upbeat and confident after the <span class="ref-pnum">success</span> of their last operations: the destruction of the Syrian reactor, the killings of Mughniyeh and Suleiman. What was urgent now was to sever another link between Iran and the terrorists, and that link had a name: Al-Mabhouh. According to the journalist Ronen Bergman, the Mossad code name for getting Al-Mabhouh was “Plasma Screen.”</p><p id="p1527" class="text-indent">In the briefing room, Dagan and his senior aides presented their plan for the killing of Mahmoud Abdel Rauf Al-Mabhouh, a leader of Hamas and the linchpin in the system of smuggling weapons from Iran via Sudan, Egypt, and the Sinai Peninsula into the Gaza strip. Al-Mabhouh, <a id="pagebreak-rw_305"></a>Dagan’s men said, would be killed in Dubai, one of the United Arab <span class="ref-pnum">Emirates</span> on the Persian Gulf.</p><p id="p1528" class="text-indent">Netanyahu approved the execution of Plasma Screen, and the <span class="ref-pnum">preparations</span> started right away. The plan was to kill Al-Mabhouh in a hotel room in Dubai. The London <em class="calibre7">Sunday Times</em> reported that the members of the Mossad hit team rehearsed the killing in a Tel Aviv hotel without notifying hotel management.</p><p id="p1529" class="text-indent">Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh, aka “Abu Abed,” was born in 1960 in the Jabalia refugee camp, in the north of the Gaza strip. In the late seventies, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood and, as a fervent Muslim, took part in sabotaging Arab cafés where gambling was practiced. In 1986, he was arrested by the Israeli Army for possession of an AK-47 assault rifle, but was released after less than a year and joined the Izz Ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigade, the military arm of Hamas.</p><p id="p1530" class="text-indent">Al-Mabhouh’s commander, Salah Shehadeh, tasked him and several other Hamas terrorists with a special mission: kidnapping and killing Israeli soldiers. On February 16, 1989, Al-Mabhouh and another Hamas member stole a car, dressed as ultra-Orthodox Jews, and offered a lift to a soldier, Avi Sasportas, who was standing at a crossroads, trying to hitch a ride home. As Sasportas entered their car, Al-Mabhouh turned back and shot him in the face. The soldier was buried by Al-Mabhouh and his <span class="ref-pnum">acolytes</span>, after they photographed themselves with the body. Three months after murdering Sasportas, Al-Mabhouh and other Hamas members <span class="ref-pnum">abducted</span> another soldier, Ilan Saadon, at the Re’em crossroads and murdered him as well. Later, in an Al-Jazeera interview, Al-Mabhouh admitted his part in the assassinations and in burying the dead soldiers.</p><p id="p1531" class="text-indent">After the second murder, Al-Mabhouh escaped to Egypt, then to <span class="ref-pnum">Jordan</span>, and continued his terrorist activities, mostly by smuggling weapons and explosives into Gaza. Back in Cairo, he was arrested by the Egyptians, spent most of 2003 in an Egyptian jail, and later escaped to Syria. He now was labeled a dangerous terrorist, wanted by the police of Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. He was regarded by his superiors as a gifted organizer and climbed <a id="pagebreak-rw_306"></a>the Hamas hierarchy, focusing most of his efforts in smuggling weapons from Iran to the Gaza strip.</p><p id="p1532" class="text-indent">Al-Mabhouh realized that he was wanted by Mossad because of his functions; he also knew that Israel would not forgive and forget the <span class="ref-pnum">murder</span> of its two soldiers. He took strict precautions, changed identities often, and posed as a businessman traveling between Middle East cities for his legitimate dealings. He told a friend that, when staying in a hotel, he used to barricade his room door with armchairs “to prevent bad surprises.”</p><p id="p1533" class="text-indent">In a rare interview he gave to the Al-Jazeera network, Al-Mabhouh <span class="ref-pnum">appeared</span> with his head covered with a black cloth. “They tried to hit me three times,” he said, “and they almost succeeded. Once in Dubai, once in Lebanon—six months ago—and a third time in Syria, two months ago, after the assassination of Imad Mughniyeh. That’s the price to be paid by all those who fight the Israelis.”</p><p id="p1534" class="text-indent">Al-Mabhouh actually gave the interview against his will; he thought it was an unnecessary risk but had to obey the explicit orders of the Hamas leadership. Some were to assert later that the interview helped Mossad to find him. Al-Mabhouh had agreed to appear in front of the cameras on one condition: that his face would be completely blurred. After the recording of the interview, the videotape was sent to Gaza for inspection. It turned out that the distorting of his face failed, and he was instructed to record the interview again. The broadcast of the new interview was postponed (it would be aired only after Al-Mabhouh’s death). Al-Mabhouh asked what happened to the first recording, and was told that the videotape was kept in the Hamas archives. Some believe that this tape made its way into the hands of the agents who were trying to find him.</p><p id="p1535" class="text-indent">A few weeks after the recording, a senior member of Hamas got a phone call from an Arab who claimed to be connected with a group that <span class="ref-pnum">specialized</span> in arms-smuggling and money-laundering. He made weapons-hungry Hamas some offers they could not refuse, and asked to meet Al-Mabhouh in Dubai. It was strange that he had chosen Dubai as a meeting place; the bustling city was actually the place where Al-Mabhouh was meeting his <a id="pagebreak-rw_307"></a>Iranian counterparts. Perhaps this mysterious phone call was Al-Mabhouh’s death sentence.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line104"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara140"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd then, an unprecedented episode in the history of the spook wars: the elimination of Plasma Screen was filmed, recorded, and <span class="ref-pnum">immortalized</span> by closed-circuit security cameras, installed all over Dubai, from the airport counters all the way down to the hotel lobbies, hallways, and elevators.</p><p id="p1536" class="text-indent">These tapes are a unique document of the unfolding of the operation and its subsequent stages: they allowed hundreds of millions of spectators throughout the world, comfortably sprawled in their armchairs, to follow a secret, deadly operation of a hit team.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line105"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara141">Monday, January 18, 2010.</p><p id="p1537" class="text-indent">Several Mossad agents land in Dubai. They are the precursors of a large team of twenty-seven agents that would trickle into Dubai in the next twenty-four hours. Twelve of them would carry British passports, four French, four Australian, one German, and six Irish.</p><p id="p1538" class="text-indent">The agents check into different hotels in the city.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line115"></div><p class="calibre1" id="p1539">Tuesday, January 19, 2010.</p><p id="p1540" class="text-indent">12:09 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—two Mossad agents, balding, forty-three-year-old Michael Bodenheimer, carrying a German passport, and his friend James Leonard, carrying a British passport, land in Dubai. The two of them, according to the local police, are the advance team of the group charged with killing Al-Mabhouh.</p><p id="p1541" class="text-indent">12:30 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—the operation commander, Kevin Daveron, sporting a <span class="ref-pnum">goatee</span> and spectacles, arrives in Dubai aboard a direct flight from Paris. He is accompanied by his deputy, Gail Folliard, a vivacious redhead. Both are carrying Irish passports.</p><p id="p1542" class="text-indent">01:21 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—Gail Folliard checks into the exclusive hotel Jumeriah and gets a room on the eleventh floor. When asked by the reception clerk for <a id="pagebreak-rw_308"></a>her home address, she answers without batting an eye: 78 Memmier Road, Dublin, Ireland. It would later be established that this address was <span class="ref-pnum">nonexistent</span>.</p><p id="p1543" class="text-indent">01:31 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—Kevin Daveron, the commander, joins his deputy and checks into the Jumeriah. He gets room 3308.</p><p id="p1544" class="text-indent">02:29 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—Peter Elvinger, the operation logistics coordinator, arrives in Dubai with a French passport. He is slim, bearded, wearing stylish glasses. According to the police, he carries a “suspicious” case.</p><p id="p1545" class="text-indent">02:36 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—at the airport, Peter meets another member of the team and they leave together for a hotel in the city.</p><p id="p1546" class="text-indent">10:15 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.—Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh departs from Damascus to Dubai, on a direct Emirates airline flight.

Kevin is not wearing his glasses, and his small mustache has vanished.</p><p id="p1549" class="text-indent">12:18 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—the meeting is over, and the team disperses. Kevin returns to the Jumeriah Hotel and checks out.

At check-in, he asks for a room with sealed windows and no terrace. He is <a id="pagebreak-rw_309"></a>given room 230 on the second floor.

The phone rang and went to voice mail. She called over and over again but with no results. A close friend also tried to reach Al-Mabhouh, but failed. Text messages sent to Al-Mabhouh remained unanswered. Time passed by and there was no sign of life from Al-Mabhouh. The distraught wife called several Hamas senior officials, who decided to send the Hamas resident <a id="pagebreak-rw_311"></a>in Dubai to the Al-Bustan Rotana Hotel. The man went to the reception desk and called room 230; there was no answer.</p><p id="p1582" class="text-indent">After midnight, the hotel employees finally went up to Al-Mabhouh’s room, unlocked the door, and found his body. A doctor rushed to the room examined the corpse and concluded that the cause of death was cardiac arrest.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line107"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara142"><span class="dropcap">H</span>amas published an official statement attributing Al-Mabhouh’s death to “medical reasons.” But Al-Mabhouh’s family rejected the medical diagnosis and insisted that Al-Mabhouh had been murdered by Mossad. His body was sent to the Dubai medical examiner, while a sample of his blood was flown to a laboratory in France. The lab <span class="ref-pnum">report</span> came back nine days later. Hamas now announced that Mossad agents had assassinated Al-Mabhouh, first stunning him with an <span class="ref-pnum">electronic</span> shocker and then suffocating him with a pillow. Simultaneously, the Dubai police announced that no traces of poison were found in <span class="ref-pnum">Al-Mabhouh’s</span> blood. Nevertheless, they quickly reached the conclusion that Mossad had killed Al-Mabhouh on their territory. On January 31, twelve days after Al-Mabhouh’s death, the London <em class="calibre7">Sunday Times</em> <span class="ref-pnum">published</span> a piece about his poisoning by Mossad. Its reporters claim that Israeli hit men had entered Al-Mabhouh’s room and injected him with a poison that simulated a heart attack; the agents then photographed all the documents he carried and exited the room, leaving behind the <span class="smallcaps">DO NOT DISTURB</span> sign.</p><p id="p1583" class="text-indent">On February 28, the deputy chief of the Dubai police informed the press that the French lab had found in Al-Mabhouh’s blood traces of a strong <span class="ref-pnum">hydrochloride</span> painkiller, used for anesthesia before surgery. This substance, he said, causes a muscular relaxation followed by a loss of consciousness. He assumed that the killers injected their victim with the anesthetic and then suffocated him so that his death would look natural.</p><p id="p1584" class="text-indent">The journalist Gordon Thomas published an article in the London <em class="calibre7"><span class="ref-pnum">Telegraph</span></em> about “Mossad’s license to kill.” Thomas asserted that the modus operandi in Al-Mabhouh’s death was similar to other assassinations <span class="ref-pnum">carried</span> <a id="pagebreak-rw_312"></a>out by Mossad in the past. He added that the eleven members of the hit team, six of them women, had been chosen out of forty-eight members of the Kidon operational unit. Yossi Melman of <em class="calibre7">Haaretz</em> daily also stressed that the killers’ moves, as reflected by the security cameras and other <span class="ref-pnum">findings</span>, were identical to past Mossad operations: arrival by separate flights from different parts of the world, stays in different hotels, phone calls placed through international operators, clothes that make identification difficult, and an effort to pose as genuine tourists or businessmen trying to mix business with pleasure. But other experts dismissed that theory, saying that these were exactly the methods used by most Western secret services, therefore it was impossible to establish clearly who had carried out the assassination.</p><p id="p1585" class="text-indent">The German weekly <em class="calibre7">Der Spiegel</em> revealed that the German intelligence agency, the BND, had informed the members of the German parliament that Al-Mabhouh had been killed by Mossad agents. <em class="calibre7">Der Spiegel</em> also <span class="ref-pnum">described</span> how Michael Bodenheimer, born in Israel, had applied in 2009 for a German passport because his parents had been born in Germany. With his new passport, he had flown, on November 8, 2009, from Frankfurt to Dubai and then to Hong Kong, an itinerary identical to his flights before and after the assassination. According to <em class="calibre7">Der Spiegel</em>, nine other agents had flown to Dubai on the same day in November 2009 from different airports in Europe. That seemed to be a dress rehearsal for the real operation carried out in January 2010.</p><p id="p1586" class="text-indent">In an interview with the <em class="calibre7">Al-Arabiya</em> newspaper, the chief of the Dubai police, Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, explained why he was certain that Mossad had killed Al-Mabhouh: “First, we have some DNA samples and <span class="ref-pnum">fingerprints</span>. Second, all of [the hit team members] carried genuine foreign passports whose details were false, and when it turned out that some of the owners [of the passports] were from Israel—so what do you think, that ‘Peace Now’ murdered Al-Mabhouh? … It is Mossad, one hundred percent!”</p><p id="p1587" class="text-indent">The chief of the Dubai police soon became a media star, spending hours in front of the world televisions, giving interviews to anyone who was ready <a id="pagebreak-rw_313"></a>to listen. He became the favorite of the television reporters, mostly thanks to Dubai’s security cameras. He showed to the press a video film, <span class="ref-pnum">actually</span> assembled from the tapes of security cameras spread all over Dubai. Tamim cleverly explained and showed how the hit team members moved throughout the emirate, and how they entered and exited hotels, <span class="ref-pnum">shopping</span> centers, and the airport, in their effort to shadow Al-Mabhouh, often changing clothes and disguises.</p><p id="p1588" class="text-indent">According to Tamim, the core of the hit team was composed of eleven members: three Irish citizens, six Britons, one Frenchman, and one <span class="ref-pnum">German</span>. They arrived in Dubai aboard several flights from various European airports, some of them the night before the operations, others at the same time as Al-Mabhouh, and a few of them a mere couple of hours before the operation. Six hundred forty-eight hours of tape from the security cameras helped the Dubai police to reconstruct the events culminating with <span class="ref-pnum">Al-Mabhouh’s</span> death.</p><p id="p1589" class="text-indent">The tapes and the photos taken by immigration authorities of all the passengers entering and exiting Dubai drove the Dubai police chief to the conclusion that not eleven but more than a score of Mossad agents <span class="ref-pnum">participated</span> in the operation. The official number he mentioned was <span class="ref-pnum">twenty-seven</span>, but Tamim later added a few more names to his list of suspects.</p><p id="p1590" class="text-indent">Yet his conclusions raised several questions: didn’t Mossad know that a network of security cameras was spread all over Dubai? According to Tamim, Israeli agents had visited Dubai several times, to prepare the <span class="ref-pnum">operation</span>. Didn’t they see the security cameras? And if they did, then perhaps a large part of the getting in and out of hotels, the change of clothes, wigs, and mustaches were nothing but a show for the cameras; and quite a few of the participants were not a part of the operation but were used only to mislead those who would examine the tapes later.</p><p id="p1591" class="text-indent">And another point: the chief of police boasted that all the members of the hit team were photographed as they went through immigration. Didn’t Mossad know that was the procedure in Dubai? Didn’t it make sure that the faces of its agents would be made up and disguised so that it would be impossible to recognize them afterward?</p><p id="p1592" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_314"></a>A third question: How come the security cameras recorded every frame and every second of the secret agents’ moves, except for two—the entering and exiting of the hit detail in and out of Al-Mabhouh’s room?</p><p id="p1593" class="text-indent">Chief Tamim revealed to the press that the members of the hit team used a phone number in Austria for some of their communications; by checking telephone records, Tamim could establish the identities of the foreigners who had used that number and were, apparently, members of the Mossad team. He also pointed out that several of the agents had paid their expenses in Dubai with Payoneer—MasterCard rechargeable credit cards, an Iowa-based company that had a research and development center in Israel.</p><p id="p1594" class="text-indent">The most intriguing revelation in the investigation was that most of the hit team members had used real passports of Israeli citizens with dual nationality—and only very few used forged passports. Apparently, this was for a reason—the hit team was operating in an Arab country that is <span class="ref-pnum">considered</span> enemy territory. If the hit team members were captured, they could ask for the protection of the consuls of Great Britain, Germany, France, and Australia … If the consuls checked their computers, they would have found out that these people really existed, and they would have agreed to assist them. If, on the contrary, the hit team had used forged passports, the deception would have been exposed right away, and the agents would have been left without protection.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line108"></div><p class="calibre1" id="p1595"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter all this became known, Israel was harshly criticized by the nations whose passports had been used in Dubai. Great Britain, Australia, and Ireland expelled the Mossad representatives from their soil. Poland <span class="ref-pnum">arrested</span> a man called Uri Brodsky at Warsaw’s airport and extradited him to Germany. Brodsky was suspected of helping the agent Michael <span class="ref-pnum">Bodenheimer</span> to obtain a German passport under false pretenses. (Brodsky was finally released by Germany after paying a fine of 60,000 euros. <span class="ref-pnum">Bodenheimer</span> was not found.) Other countries expressed their indignation and fury. These reactions seemed laced with hypocrisy, as the use of forged or doctored passports is the standard rule of secret service activity; the <a id="pagebreak-rw_315"></a>nations now accusing Israel were and are using forged passports exactly the same way as Mossad. Yet when a Russian spy network was uncovered in the United States in late 2010, nobody accused its members of using forged British and American papers.</p><p id="p1596" class="text-indent">The reports in the world press created the impression that the Dubai operation was successful but had suffered from a grave mistake, the result of Israel’s gross underestimation of Dubai and the Western nations they <span class="ref-pnum">involved</span>. That was a blow to Israel’s international image, but not to its secret activity. The expelled Mossad envoys were soon replaced by others. The promises of the Dubai chief of police that the hit team members would be apprehended, because their identities were known all over the world, went unanswered. Not one Mossad agent of the Dubai team was identified by any police and arrested.</p><p id="p1597" class="text-indent">Yet Dubai became a symbol of the new challenges facing any secret <span class="ref-pnum">service</span> in a changing world. The cloak-and-dagger era is definitely over. <span class="ref-pnum">Security</span> cameras, photographs and thumbprints at immigration, rapid checks of passports, DNA … all those require much more sophisticated means and methods from the spooks of this world when they set off on their dark, sinister missions.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line109"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara143"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n April 7, 2011, an unidentified aircraft fired a missile on a passenger car, on a road fifteen kilometers south of Port Sudan, in the African state of Sudan. According to Israeli sources, the car was attacked by a Shoval drone that can fly four thousand kilometers without refueling and carry a load of a ton. The Shoval is of a new generation of drones that <span class="ref-pnum">Israel</span> now uses in risky over-the-border missions, replacing aircraft piloted by men. The Israeli drones, some of the best in the world, carry out <span class="ref-pnum">intelligence</span> and attack missions all over the Middle East.</p><p id="p1598" class="text-indent">One of the two people killed in the car attack in Sudan was said to be a Hamas leader. Hamas used the Sudan trail for smuggling weapons from Iran to Gaza. The weapons came by boat, were unloaded in Port Sudan, and proceeded in a convoy of vehicles via Egypt and the Sinai to Gaza, their drivers bribing their way through borders and check posts.</p><p id="p1599" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_316"></a>The Sudanese government immediately accused Israel of the coup.</p><p id="p1600" class="text-indent">Israel had been designated as the culprit for another mysterious attack on a weapons convoy in January 2009; the trucks carrying weapons, <span class="ref-pnum">missiles</span>, and explosives had been destroyed, and forty people manning the convoy had been killed.</p><p id="p1601" class="text-indent">One of the men allegedly killed was the Hamas leader in charge of smuggling weapons from Iran to Gaza.</p></div>
