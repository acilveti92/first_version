<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter018">EIGHTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">Slythurst tried to pull me up roughly by the arm, but I twisted away from him, curling my body around the package lest he try to wrench it from me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will explain yourself this time, Bruno,’ he said, anger replacing his usual cold sarcasm as I struggled against his grip and he tried to reach for the package. It was too much of a coincidence that he should be awake and dressed at this hour of the night; he must have been watching Norris’s room. ‘What is it you have taken from that room? I must see it. I demand you hand it over to me.’ There was a hectic urgency in his voice and I saw genuine alarm in his eyes as he looked at the bundle in my hand; could it be that he knew the importance of what I carried?</p>
<p class="indented">‘Demand all you like,’ I gasped, lashing out with my bandaged hand, ‘but I cannot give this to you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am a senior Fellow of this college,’ Slythurst spluttered, trying to keep his dignity, ‘and you must acknowledge my authority here. If you have taken something of value from a student’s room, it must be shown to the rector.’ His tone was shrill with panic; again he tried to snatch it; again I jerked away from him. I saw that he was determined to have it, and knew that it must not fall into the hands of the rector; both Slythurst and Underhill, I thought, were quite capable of destroying any evidence they thought might make things difficult for the college, and my discovery in Norris’s room would be the end of Underhill if it was made public. Slythurst studied me for a moment, his mouth set in a grim line, then he put his lantern on the ground and rushed at me with both hands free. He was surprisingly strong for a thin man and almost knocked me over as he lunged for the package, but I kicked backwards while covering the bundle with both arms, my foot landing hard in his stomach. Winded, he doubled over, and before he could gather himself for his next assault, I threw a punch with my bandaged right hand, catching him on the chin and sending a bolt of pain up my arm. He stumbled backwards, then unexpectedly rallied and threw himself forward at my legs, knocking me to the ground. I heard my back crunch as I hit the flagstones and I tried to wrestle the package beneath me but he had the advantage of weight and quickly straddled me, pinning me to the ground. His face was almost in mine as he grasped the papers; I feared he would tear them as he tried to prise them from my grip and a sudden surge of anger redoubled my efforts to protect them.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Hand those to me, Bruno – you are meddling in matters you do not understand,’ he hissed through his teeth; I could smell his sour breath in my nostrils.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You do not even know what I have here,’ I spat back, clutching the papers to my chest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Whatever you have removed from a student’s room is the property of the college in that student’s absence,’ he whispered, still pompous even as he scrabbled at my hands.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why do you want it so urgently?’ I hissed back. ‘Because you didn’t manage to find it when you turned the room upside down yourself? Do you always help yourself to keys while Cobbett is sleeping?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The question, Bruno,’ he said, his nostrils flaring, ‘is how <em class="calibre2">you</em> knew what to look for and where to find it? It can only be that you are part of the papist conspiracy. But who would expect otherwise of an Italian? The rector is a gullible fool, but I always saw through you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is you who is out of your depth,’ I grunted, bucking my back to try and throw him off balance, ‘but I am no papist and those who matter know that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You <em class="calibre2">will</em> give me those papers, Bruno,’ he panted, shifting his weight so that he was bending right over me, his nose almost touching mine, ‘or I will rouse the whole college. With three of our number newly dead, you will be locked up in the Castle gaol before you have a chance to fashion your latest implausible tale.’</p>
<p class="indented">So Slythurst was <em class="calibre2">against</em> the papists, I thought, as his knee dug into my chest. But then why was he so keen to cover up evidence of the murders? What did he want with the papers I was now fighting to keep out of his grasp, that he had ransacked first Mercer’s and now Norris’s room in search of them? Whatever his purpose, I knew no one must have those papers but Walsingham, and that I must deliver them to Sidney myself. As I felt the package begin to slide from my damaged hand, I mustered all the reserves of strength I had left. Clenching my jaw, I sat up as far as I could, my face so near to Slythurst’s that it might have seemed I was about to kiss him, then drew my head back slightly and jerked it sharply upwards, so that my forehead hit him squarely in the nose with a smart crack. He let out a howl, clutching both hands to his nose, and I took the opportunity to throw him off balance and roll away. A dull pain swam across my head and my vision blurred, but it seemed he had come off the worse; when he took his hand away I saw his nose was bleeding copiously. Above my head another light approached, swaying, accompanied by a slow shuffle of footsteps.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What in God’s name …?’ Cobbett began, lifting his lantern and stopping with a frown of amazement to see me and Slythurst brawling like drunkards in the middle of the quadrangle. I noticed that in his other hand he carried a sturdy stick. ‘Doctor Bruno? Lord, you look a right state. How did you get in?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Long story, Cobbett,’ I said, hobbling to my feet. ‘I need your help.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Seize him, Cobbett!’ Slythurst cried, the words muffled by the hand still clamped to his broken nose. ‘He has stolen property – as a Fellow of this college, I order you to apprehend him!’</p>
<p class="indented">Cobbett looked from Slythurst to me with some concern. I grabbed his sleeve and wheeled him away, out of Slythurst’s earshot.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You must believe me, Cobbett – this is a matter of utmost urgency. I think I know where to find the killer, and others may die tonight if I don’t act.’ Seeing that he looked uncertain, I added, in a whisper, ‘Sophia is in danger. I have to go this moment – tell me, where will I find my horse? He is in the rector’s stable, I understand.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett, do not open the gate! This man must not leave the college buildings with that package, do you understand?’ Slythurst sounded desperate now; lurching to his feet, he lunged unsteadily again at me and though I was still dizzy from the impact of the last blow, I hurled myself towards him, my teeth bared.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Ne vuoi di piu’? Fatti sotto</em>,’ I snarled, pulling out the kitchen knife I had removed from Humphrey Pritchard and thrusting it out before me. ‘Come on then, if you want some more.’</p>
<p class="indented">Slythurst may not have understood my words but he could not mistake the meaning of the knife; he took a step back, stared at me defiantly for the briefest moment, then raised his head and screamed out ‘Murder!’ with all the force of his lungs. On two sides of the quadrangle a number of windows creaked open and shadowy figures leaned out, alarmed by the disturbance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I must go this instant,’ I whispered to Cobbett, still holding the knife out towards Slythurst, who had clearly decided his best hope was to wake the whole college and set them to apprehend me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He will have the watch on you,’ Cobbett muttered, as Slythurst raised his cry of ‘Murder!’ again. ‘You will need to ride fast if you hope to leave the city. The rector’s stable is almost directly opposite, on Cheney Lane. Come.’ And the old porter ushered me towards the main gate, moving at a pace I had never seen from him before.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I must get these papers to Christ Church,’ I hissed, as he unlocked the gate. Slythurst watched us but made no move towards us this time; he seemed to have decided to wait for reinforcements. ‘Which is the best way?’</p>
<p class="indented">Cobbett shook his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘If you ride to Christ Church now, they will apprehend you before you can leave the city,’ he whispered, barely audible. ‘Give the papers to me – I will send a messenger I trust.’</p>
<p class="indented">I glanced back at Slythurst, who was now calling up to someone leaning from a first-floor window. Cobbett moved so that his broad back was blocking me from Slythurst’s sight and motioned for me to hand over the papers.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They must get to Sir Philip Sidney without delay,’ I mouthed. ‘No one else must see them. Men have died for these papers, Cobbett. Can you swear your messenger is trustworthy?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘On my life,’ he grunted. ‘Now in God’s name, be on your way, Bruno, and God speed you. Bring back Sophia.’ The sound of more footsteps rang out on the flagstones; Cobbett eased open the small door just a crack and I passed him the package wrapped in Norris’s shirt, which quickly disappeared inside Cobbett’s capacious old coat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Has Master Godwyn returned?’ I hissed, as I slipped across the threshold. He frowned.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’ve seen no one leave the college tonight except you. The gate has been locked all this time.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then he must have left by another way, the Grove, perhaps.’ So Godwyn too might still be at large, and I had a good idea of where I might find him.</p>
<p class="indented">Cobbett nodded, then pushed me urgently out into the lane and I heard the lock snap swiftly shut behind me.</p>
<p class="indented">I hardly dared look over my shoulder as I ran as hard as I could into Cheney Lane, a narrow street that ran along the side of Jesus College, almost opposite. Fortunately, buildings were sparse, and the brick stable block was not hard to find, even in the dark, by the smell and the soft noises of horses in sleep. I banged urgently on the gate, fearing that at any moment Slythurst and a gang of men from Lincoln might arrive to apprehend me for theft, while from the other direction I was still expecting Jenkes or any of his cronies, bent on killing me. After a few moments, a tousle-haired stable boy holding a candle opened the gate a crack, his eyes sleepy but scared.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sir?’ he murmured, but I pushed roughly past him into the stable yard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I need my horse, son, this very instant. The one brought in last Friday, the grey – I am Doctor Bruno, of the royal party.’</p>
<p class="indented">The boy’s eyes widened further and he bit his lip.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am not supposed to let anyone take the horses out when Master Clayton is not here, sir. And he is a very fine horse.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He is. From the queen’s own stables. But I swear I am not stealing him. Now, bring him, will you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will be beaten, sir,’ he said pleadingly. I could not blame him for his caution; quite apart from the hour, I could not have looked less like a royal visitor with my bruised face and bleeding throat. I hated having to resort to this, but once again I lifted the knife from my belt and let him have a brief glimpse of it. The poor child looked around as if someone might come to his assistance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Please,’ I added, in a gentler tone, as if this might improve the situation.</p>
<p class="indented">He hesitated for a moment, then appeared to decide that the prospective beating was the better option.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It will take a few minutes to saddle him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then don’t. A harness only – but hurry, please, I do not have time to lose.’</p>
<p class="indented">I wheeled around again to the door, thinking I heard footsteps, but there was only the shifting of the horses’ hooves in their stalls. But my fear had communicated to the boy; he gave a silent nod and hastened off to fit the horse’s halter. I stood, hopping from foot to foot and biting my lip as I watched the gate to the yard, careless of the pains in my hand, shoulders, throat and my back after my tussle with Slythurst; all that mattered now was that I should not be detained. I hoped I had done the right thing in trusting Cobbett, but knew he was right; even if I rode to Christ Church myself, I would not be able to see Sidney at this time of night and could only leave my precious package with the porter there, while Slythurst would have alerted the constable and the watchmen that a thief had escaped from Lincoln and I would never get through the city gates. I could only pray that Slythurst did not intercept the papers before Cobbett’s messenger managed to despatch them.</p>
<p class="indented">The boy appeared, anxiously leading my horse by his elaborate velvet harness, its brass trappings jingling loudly in the still air; the horse seemed sluggish and less than pleased to have been disturbed in the dark. I led him to a mounting block in the middle of the yard, then scrambled on to his back. He did a little dance of surprise and snorted in protest, but I held the reins firmly and he submitted. The boy held the gate open, and I kicked my heels into the horse’s flanks and wheeled him around, turning him to the left, in the opposite direction to Lincoln College.</p>
<p class="indented">At the other end, Cheney Lane opened on to the North Street, and the faint pallor gradually staining the skyline to my left guided me eastwards. Now I could just see enough to make out the covered stalls of the Cornmarket ahead, and I urged the horse into a trot, though he seemed reluctant to quicken his pace, the miry ground slippery under his hooves. At the Carfax crossroads I urged him left on to the High Street and presently saw the East Gate ahead, where we had entered the city amid such pomp only five days earlier, its small barbican guarding the road out to London. The light of a lantern flickered in the ramparts of the tower and I knew that everything depended on my passing the watchmen here without being detained. Slythurst would have roused the college servants by now and whoever had been sent in pursuit of me could not be far behind.</p>
<p class="indented">As I pulled the horse to a standstill a man in city livery brandishing a pikestaff stepped out from the gatehouse.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who goes there?’ he barked, levelling it at me and taking a step forward. The horse whinnied in alarm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Royal messenger,’ I panted. ‘I carry an urgent message from Sir Philip Sidney.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A shilling to pass before first light.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not have a shilling. My orders are to take a message to the Privy Council in London without delay.’ I drew myself up on the horse, hoping that an authoritative manner would distract from my appearance. ‘And if this message does not get through, the Earl of Leicester will have your balls nailed to this gate as a warning, I swear it.’</p>
<p class="indented">I glanced again over my shoulder, certain I could hear noises from further up the High Street. The watchman hesitated for a moment, then laboriously began to unbolt and heave open the solid wooden gate while I reined the horse in tightly; he could sense my impatience and tension and was growing restless.</p>
<p class="indented">As I crossed the city boundary there came a distinct shout from behind me of ‘Hie! Stop that rider!’</p>
<p class="indented">I kicked my heels into the horse’s flanks and urged him into a canter. Though the ground was still soft beneath his hooves, the road was at least wider, this being the main highway out to London, and the darkness was thinning a little, the stars growing paler as dawn light edged the eastern horizon ahead. Wind caught the horse’s mane as he obligingly thundered through the ruts of cartwheels and potholes, just as it stung my own eyes and nose as I crouched low over his neck, trying to keep my grip without a saddle, occasionally glancing behind me to see if anyone was following. He was a fast horse, and soon it seemed that we had covered enough distance to make it extremely difficult for anyone to catch us. Now that I could breathe again, I found room for doubts about the sense of my plan. It had seemed obvious, when I was talking to Humphrey, that I would find the missing pieces of the puzzle at Hazeley Court, but now that I was out of the city with no real idea of how to find the place, I wondered if I had only made a wild guess that would come to nothing, while the drama played itself out to the last by another route altogether.</p>
<p class="indented">I had ridden for perhaps half an hour, the sky growing lighter all the time and the birdsong more insistent with it, while a damp mist rose from the hedgerows, obscuring the distant fields. The scent of wet earth rose in my nostrils. There was no sign of any settlement and I began to grow fearful that I had made a terrible mistake; not only might I fail to find Thomas and Sophia before it was too late, but now I could not turn back. If Jenkes or Slythurst had pursued me from the city and caught up with me on this forsaken road, there would be no one to come to my aid.</p>
<p class="indented">I rounded a corner in the road between hedgerows, our pace now slowed to a steady trot, when the horse almost stumbled over a flock of sheep being driven in the direction of Oxford by an old man with a misshapen crook in his hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sir – could you tell me where I might find the manor house of Hazeley Court? Am I on the right road?’ I called.</p>
<p class="indented">The drover looked up, suspicious.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What you say?’</p>
<p class="indented">I took a deep breath and repeated my question, in the clearest English I could manage.</p>
<p class="indented">He pointed back in the direction he had come.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Another half mile or so – you’ll see two large oaks on the left and between them a cart track. Follow that to the manor house. What business have you there?’ he asked, eyeing me curiously.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Official business,’ I said, since this had served me well before.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They are all papists there, you know,’ he muttered, as my horse picked his way between the sheep. I thanked him for the warning and, as soon as we were free of the flock, kicked the horse to pick up his pace. My back and legs were aching brutally now and the reins were chafing at my burned hand, but I was heartened to learn that the house was nearby. Perhaps here I would find the answers I was looking for.</p>
