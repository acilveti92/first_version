<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter003">THREE</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">I dressed for dinner in a clean shirt with a plain black doublet and breeches and paused for a moment to consider myself in the mottled glass that had been left resting on my mantelpiece. My hair and beard were a little too long, it was true, and the weather had left them more unruly than usual, though I had long ago decided at the Parisian court that I had neither the time nor the vanity to compete with gentlemen of fashion in matters of dress. But at thirty-five, I thought, I could still make myself presentable. My reflection looked back from large dark eyes pooled in shadow; our scuffle on the road had left a graze on my cheek, but perhaps a young woman confined in a college cloister might find that intriguing. I knew that women found enough in my appearance to please them, even though I was no prospect for a serious attachment, having neither property nor title but only a dubious kind of fame to my name; for my part, I had made the most of such opportunities as came my way in Paris, but since Morgana’s death I had met no woman with equal wit and spirit to catch my heart as well as my eye. But the rector’s daughter sounded intriguing, and I must confess that the prospect of meeting her had piqued my interest, even though I knew I could hardly afford distractions in Oxford with so much at stake and so few days.</p>
<p class="indented">I grinned at my reflection in the glass, ran my hands through my hair and shook my head briefly at my own foolishness, before making my way down my staircase to the archway in the east range where I had been told I would find the rector’s lodgings. As I entered its shadows, my eye was caught by a glimpse of green from the other end of the passageway, which ran the width of the building; following it to the end I emerged through an open gate of iron bars into a walled garden at the back of the college, not over-cultivated but left as an orchard, the grass grown tall and thick with wild flowers under apple trees and wooden benches set at intervals along the path that ran around by the walls. In better weather this would be a pleasant place for scholars to sit and read, I thought, though it was empty now as the rain battered at the leaves. I returned to the passageway and found the door that proclaimed the rector’s name on a plaque, straightened my clothes, and prepared myself for my first taste of Oxford hospitality.</p>
<p class="indented">The first thing I noticed as I waited to be admitted was that the animated conversation I could hear from behind the door was pitched slightly too loud, in the way that men in a group will compete to outdo one another if they want to impress a woman. An old servant with a pinched face opened the door and showed me straight through into a fine high room with tall arched windows in two facing walls, the rest panelled in dark wood and hung with portraits and tapestries. Immediately I understood the source of this braggadocio. At the far side of a long table set with grand sconces of candles sat a young woman of about nineteen years, dressed in a plain dove-grey gown with a straight embroidered bodice and with her long dark hair unbound. Like the rest of the guests already seated, she stopped her conversation and turned her attention to me as I approached, her eyes skimming me up and down with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. This, then, was Sophia Underhill, and I understood her father’s urgent wish to marry her off; she had a striking, feline face with keen light brown eyes and her presence in the college must have proved a sore distraction for the young men trying to bend their minds to their books. The rector rose from his chair at the head of the table with bustling importance and reached out to shake my hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Welcome, Doctor Bruno, welcome to my table. Please be seated, and I shall introduce you to some of the college’s senior Fellows, and my family.’</p>
<p class="indented">He gestured to the seat on his left hand, which I was pleased to note was almost opposite his daughter’s. I nodded politely to her in greeting before glancing around at the rest of the guests assembled at the table. We were ten in number, all men dressed in academic gowns, with the exception of the girl and a tired-looking woman of middle years seated at the other end of the table, opposite the rector.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Allow me to introduce my wife, Mistress Margaret Underhill,’ he began, gesturing towards her.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Piacere di conoscerla</em>,’ I said, bowing my head. The woman smiled weakly; despite her husband’s earlier words, she did not look especially delighted at the prospect of entertaining.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And my daughter Sophia,’ the rector continued, unable to keep the note of pride from his voice. ‘You see that I gave her the Greek name for wisdom.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then her suitors may truly call themselves “philosophers”,’ I replied, smiling at her. ‘Lovers of Sophia.’</p>
<p class="indented">There was a sharp intake of breath from her mother at the end of the table and a suppressed laugh from the men present, but the girl returned my smile and blushed pleasingly before lowering her eyes. The rector forced a smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah, yes, I was warned that the men of your country are experts in the art of flattering ladies,’ he said tightly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Especially the monks,’ grunted the elderly man seated to the right of Sophia, and the guests all laughed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Former</em> monks,’ I said emphatically, holding the girl’s gaze. This time she did not look away, and something in the frankness of her look reminded me so sharply of Morgana that I had to catch my breath, caught off-guard by the resemblance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I must protest in defence of my countrymen,’ declared the dark-haired young man seated to my immediate left, who did indeed look distinctly Italian, though he spoke with no trace of an accent. ‘My father’s countrymen, I should say. I do not know how we have come by this reputation among the English as great seducers – I have certainly not inherited any such talent, alas.’ He held out his palms in a gesture of defeat and the company laughed again. I suspected the young man of false modesty in this regard – he was blessed with handsome features and obviously dressed carefully, his beard and moustache neatly trimmed. He turned to me and extended a hand. ‘John Florio, son of Michelangelo Florio of Tuscany – I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Doctor Bruno of Nola. Your reputation precedes you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Which one?’ I said, to more laughter.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Master Florio is a greatly respected scholar and tutor of languages, as was his father,’ said the rector, ‘and he is engaged in compiling a book of proverbs from various countries. I am sure that later he will not hesitate to regale us with some.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is, and ever was, a woman’s fashion / To love a cross, and cross a loving passion,’ Florio said obligingly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He speaks the truth,’ Sophia said, with feigned dismay, and Florio beamed at her.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you,’ said the rector, his smile growing increasingly strained. ‘I must confess, Doctor Bruno, I did not know how easily you would converse in English and I thought you might feel more at home with a fellow Italian speaker to hand.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That was kind of you,’ I said. ‘I learned my English from travellers and scholars over the years, but I fear it is unpolished.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘My father also fled Italy in fear of the Inquisition after he converted to Reform,’ Florio said eagerly, leaning in close. ‘He came to London, ended up in Lord Burghley’s household and was later Italian tutor to Lady Jane Grey and the Princess Elizabeth.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not such a cursed exile, then,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Exile is always a curse,’ the elderly man next to Sophia cut in, with surprising vehemence. ‘A cruel fate to inflict on any man, do you not agree, Roger?’ Here he leaned around to glare at the man seated on the other side of Sophia, directly opposite me, a large, broad-featured man in his late forties, with a full beard just turning to grey and a ruddy complexion, who turned away uncomfortably. ‘Particularly on one’s friends,’ the old man added. A tense silence descended over the gathering.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My father was indeed fortunate in his patrons,’ Florio continued hastily, attempting to cover the interruption, ‘though we were exiled again from England when I was just an infant and Bloody Mary came to the throne.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘God rest her soul,’ interjected the elderly man, reverently. This time the rector moved to intervene.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Please,</em> Doctor Bernard.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Please what, Rector?’ Doctor Bernard gestured at me, his wild white hair fanning out around his head like the crest of a bird. ‘Must I guard my words for this renegade monk? Why – will he denounce me to the Earl of Leicester?’ He turned to look at me and I understood that, though he had few teeth left and must have been at least seventy, his rheumy eyes still saw shrewdly. The hollows of his face seemed more pronounced in the flickering shadows of the candlelight; it was a face to frighten children. ‘I was appointed by Queen Mary herself, thirty years ago now, when those of the new faith were almost purged altogether from the university, and here I have remained through the storms, though my friends are all long dead or deprived of office, and I have long since renounced the old ways.’ Here he laughed, as if in self-mockery, then pointed at me, suddenly grave. ‘But I think you are of the Catholic faith, are you not, Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am an Italian,’ I replied evenly, ‘raised in the church of Rome.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, I’m afraid you will find no one to say the Roman Mass with you here, sir. There are no Catholics left in Oxford, oh no. No man here cleaves to the old faith.’ He shook his head solemnly, but his voice was filled with bitter sarcasm. ‘Here we all sign the Declaration of Belief to save our skins, and swear our oath to the English Church as we are commanded, for we are all obedient subjects, are we not, gentlemen?’</p>
<p class="indented">There was an awkward murmur of assent; I saw that the rector was growing agitated.</p>
<p class="indented">‘William, I beg you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So we all seem. But no man in Oxford is what he seems, Doctor Bruno, keep that in mind. Not even you, I suspect.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked up and met Doctor William Bernard’s eye. This spiky and gnomic old man gave the distinct and alarming impression of being able to read the secret thoughts of others, and he was nearer to the truth than I liked, so I merely inclined my head and searched for a distraction as his pale grey eyes continued to bore into me. Fortunately, one was provided by the arrival of servants bearing plates laden with the first course: boiled capons with damsons and calves’-foot jelly accompanied by a good claret.</p>
<p class="indented">As they bustled around the table, heaping our plates from each dish, I leaned forward with the intention of engaging Sophia Underhill in conversation, but at the same moment the bearded man opposite addressed me, and I saw Florio take the opportunity to claim the girl’s attention.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Roger Mercer, Doctor of Divinity and sub-rector of the college,’ the bearded man said in a rich baritone, with an accent that I believed came from the west parts of England. He extended a hand across the table. ‘We are indeed glad to make your acquaintance, Doctor Bruno, and there has been much anticipation here for your disputation with the rector tomorrow night.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Now, now, Roger,’ said the rector hastily, ‘there is to be no talk of any matter touching the disputation at table. My esteemed guest and I must preserve our arguments for the debating chamber, is that not so, Doctor Bruno? We must, as they say, keep our powder dry.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded my assent. Roger Mercer held up his hand in protest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Fear not, Rector – I spoke only as a prelude to telling Doctor Bruno how I have been curious to meet him since I read his book, <em class="calibre2">On the Shadows of Ideas</em>, that was published in Paris last year.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did not the sorcerer Cecco d’Ascoli, who was burned for necromancy, make mention of a book with the same title, a book of forbidden magic which he attributed to Solomon?’ Doctor Bernard leaned around Sophia once more to make this interjection, his trembling extended finger pointing almost in her face, though aimed at me. She moved her chair backwards to accommodate him, flicking her hair over one shoulder while continuing her conversation with the irrepressibly enthusiastic Florio. From the odd phrase I could catch, he appeared to be treating her to further rhyming aphorisms. Reluctantly I turned my attention back to Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The book Cecco mentions has never been found,’ I said, raising my voice so that the old man might hear me clearly. ‘It seemed a shame to waste a good title, so I borrowed it. But mine is a treatise on the art of memory, based on the memory systems of the Greeks – no necromancy, gentlemen.’ I laughed, perhaps too hard.</p>
<p class="indented">Roger Mercer eyed me thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And yet, Doctor Bruno, your memory system makes use of images that seem to correspond precisely to the talismanic figures described by Agrippa in his <em class="calibre2">De Occulta Philosophia</em>, that he claims can be invoked in the rituals of celestial magic to draw down the powers of angels and demons.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But these are images that correspond to the signs of the zodiac and the mansions of the moon, familiar to many mnemonic systems,’ I said, hoping not to betray my unease. ‘They are popular because they are based on regular numerical divisions, which aids in recall, but in the end they are merely images.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nothing is <em class="calibre2">merely</em> an image to the magician,’ Bernard snapped back. ‘All are signs pointing to hidden realities, as your title implies. Especially those images derived from the ancient astrology of the Egyptians – as Agrippa well knew, for he was quoting from his master, Hermes Trismegistus, who was condemned by St Augustine for summoning demons!’</p>
<p class="indented">His voice rose on this last word; a cold hand gripped the base of my spine. I drew myself up to answer, but before I could speak, Sophia Underhill pulled her chair nearer to the table, looked directly at me and asked, cutting off Florio in mid-sentence,</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is Hermes Trismegistus?’</p>
<p class="indented">The company fell silent; all eyes turned to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have read passing reference to his name in works of philosophy,’ she continued, with an innocence I did not quite believe, ‘but I can find none of his books in our library here, and I don’t have permission to enter the university libraries.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nor should you, since you are not a scholar,’ chided her father, looking around the table as if embarrassed by her boldness. ‘I permit you to improve your mind by reading in our library as long as you keep your studies to what is fit for a lady’s understanding.’</p>
<p class="indented">I felt he said this for the benefit of the company; Sophia appeared about to protest, but then swallowed her words into a petulant expression. Her mother tutted again, loudly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will find no works of Hermes the Thrice-Great in Oxford now,’ Bernard said in a sonorous voice, shaking his head. ‘Before, we had them – before the great purge of the libraries in ’69. Translated out of the Greek by the Florentine Ficino a century ago, at the dying request of Cosimo de’ Medici. You know Ficino’s version, Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have read Ficino’s translation,’ I said. ‘But I have also read the original Greek manuscripts, though the collection is incomplete. The fifteenth book was lost. Do you read Greek, Doctor Bernard?’</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard fixed me with those bright, accusing eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I read Greek, young man, we are not all barbarians north of the Tiber. But the missing book is a myth – it never existed,’ he added briskly. Then he went on, in a softer tone, ‘I read Ficino too, when I was young, and Agrippa. There was not such a fear of the ancient writers then. But so many books are lost to us now, carried off by the tides of reform. Centuries of learning, burned to ashes.’ He tailed off and it seemed he had travelled deep into memory.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bernard,’ said the rector, a warning note in his voice again, ‘you know very well that the Royal Commission of ’69 was sent to seek out heretical books acquired in the old monastic times, lest they infect the minds of our young men with their unholy ideas – a danger we senior Fellows must guard against still. I am sure you would not wish to disagree with such a prohibition.’</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard gave a short, croaking laugh. ‘Books prohibited to scholars? How then should men of learning sharpen their intellect, or learn to discern between truth and heresy? And do those who proscribe not have the wit to realise that forbidden books lure men more potently than the lewdest temptress?’ Here he cast a sideways glance at Sophia. ‘Oh yes – but a forbidden book will always find its way in through the cracks and the mouseholes, do you not know that, Rector? If one only knows where to look.’ He cackled to himself as if this were a great joke, and I noticed his fellow scholars were shifting uncomfortably in their seats.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What happened to the books that were purged from the libraries then?’ I asked, perhaps too urgently, for my question seemed to provoke a sudden hostility from Bernard; his eyes narrowed and he pulled himself stiffly upright.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was a long time ago,’ he said brusquely. ‘Burned or taken away by the authorities – who knows? I am old now, and I have forgotten those days.’</p>
<p class="indented">He did not quite meet my gaze and I knew he was lying; a man who spoke so passionately about books one moment would surely have remembered a public bonfire of them, even if it had occurred many years ago. But if the forbidden books were not burned, they must have passed into someone’s hands, and I wondered if the old man knew whose.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno, you have still not answered my question,’ Sophia cut in, leaning across to tap my hand while fixing me with her wide-set, tawny eyes. The hint of a smile played around her full mouth, as if she too knew a great joke and was considering letting us in on it. ‘Who <em class="calibre2">was</em> he?’</p>
<p class="indented">I took a deep breath, and returned her expectant gaze as steadily as I could, aware that the whole table had fallen silent, awaiting my answer, and that there was every chance my next words might be considered blasphemy.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Hermes Trismegistus, called the Thrice-Great, was an Egyptian high priest of great antiquity,’ I began, turning over a piece of bread in my fingers. ‘He lived after the time of Moses, long before Plato or Christ. Some say he was the Egyptian god Thoth, the divinity of wisdom. In any case, he was a man of unusual insight who achieved, through profound contemplation of the cosmos and experimentation with the properties of the natural world, the wisdom to unlock the secrets written in the book of nature and the heavens. He claimed to have entered and understood the Divine Mind.’ I paused. ‘He claimed he could become equal to God.’</p>
<p class="indented">Here there was a collective gasp from around the table; these men knew that this was indeed dangerous ground to tread, and I quickly added,</p>
<p class="indented">‘He is called the first philosopher, the first theologian, and he was also a prophet – Lactantius credited him with foretelling the advent of the Christian faith, in the very words of the gospel.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And Augustine said he had his foreknowledge from the Devil,’ Roger Mercer said eagerly, his face reddening further as half-chewed meat fell from his mouth and lodged in his beard, though he appeared not to notice. ‘For does Hermes not write of how the Egyptians animated the idols of their gods in magical rites by calling down the powers of demons?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have never believed the account of the demons and the statues,’ I said lightly. ‘Men have always created mechanical toys and automatons and claimed to have endowed them with the gift of life, like the brazen head possessed by Roger Bacon that was reported to prophesy. But this is merely conjuring and skilled craftsmanship.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Hermes Trismegistus was no magician, then?’ Sophia said softly, still looking at me. She seemed disappointed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He wrote at length on the hidden properties of plants and stones and the arrangement of the cosmos,’ I replied. ‘There are some who call this alchemy or natural magic, and others who call it scientific enquiry.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘When it is done for the purpose of seeking forbidden powers, it is called sorcery,’ the rector put in, sternly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But did he discover any magic that worked?’ she persisted, ignoring her father.</p>
<p class="indented">‘How do you mean, <em class="calibre2">worked</em>?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I mean, was he able to use this natural magic to influence the world – to change people’s thoughts or deeds, for example, and did he write of how it is done?’ Her eyes were bright and impatient now as she leaned closer.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Recipes for spells, you mean?’ I laughed. ‘I’m afraid not. The Hermetic magic, if you want to give it that name, is concerned with teaching the adept how to penetrate the mysteries of the universe through the light of the intellect. He cannot teach you how to make your sweetheart fall in love with you or keep him true – for that you had better consult some village wise-woman.’</p>
<p class="indented">There was some amusement at this from those at our end of the table, but the girl coloured violently and I suspected that my joke had accidentally struck the truth, so to cover her embarrassment I continued, hastily:</p>
<p class="indented">‘But the German alchemist Henry Cornelius Agrippa does speak of such things, in his treatise on the occult sciences that Doctor Mercer mentioned earlier. He writes that, as well as the celestial images used in magic, we may create our own fitting to our purpose. For example, he says that to procure love, we may create an image of people embracing.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But how –’ Sophia began, just as the rector coughed loudly and the servants entered to clear away the first course.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, this has been a most illuminating discussion, Doctor Bruno – I knew your conversation and your unusual ideas would enliven our little college society,’ the rector said, patting me on the shoulder with considerable insincerity. ‘But I have devised that we should all change places for each course, so that you may become acquainted with some of the other important officials of the college. Much as I would like to continue with our theme …’ he added.</p>
<p class="indented">Now he rose from his seat and fussed around the table, officiously rearranging the seating plan so that I found myself at the opposite end, surrounded by the three men to whom I had not yet spoken. The servants brought in silver dishes steaming with richly scented beef and a stew of vegetables, and in the course of all this activity, the rector’s wife, who had barely spoken, took the opportunity to excuse herself with a headache, apologising profusely to me for being such a poor hostess. She seemed a melancholic and sickly woman, but I recalled what the rector had told me about their son; I had seen such symptoms previously in women who had lost a child, often years after the death, as if the mind itself had taken some wasting sickness from which it could not recover, and I felt profoundly sorry for her. It was hard to credit that such a forlorn creature could have been the author of the lively girl at the other end of the table.</p>
<p class="indented">The second half of the meal passed with considerably less interest than the first, now that I had been removed from Sophia’s company. My new dining companions introduced themselves: opposite me sat Master Walter Slythurst, the college bursar, a bony, thin-lipped man of my own age with narrow, suspicious eyes and lank hair that fell in curtains around his face. Beside him was Doctor James Coverdale, a plump man of about forty with a great sweep of dark hair, a close-cropped beard and an air of complacency, who explained that he was the proctor, the official responsible for the students’ discipline. To my right was Master Richard Godwyn, the librarian, who appeared older, perhaps fifty, and whose large, drooping features reminded me of a bloodhound, as though his skin were too big for his face, though his gloomy countenance was transformed when he allowed a brief smile to illuminate it as he shook my hand. All were courteous enough, but I could not help but wish I had been allowed to continue my discussion with Sophia. It was clear that the tenor of our conversation had angered her father; she was now seated next to him, on the same side of the table as me, so that I could not see her without rudely leaning around my neighbour Godwyn and drawing attention to myself.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I fear you have had to suffer the sharp end of William Bernard’s tongue up there, Doctor Bruno,’ said James Coverdale, leaning across the table.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He seems disappointed with the world as he finds it,’ I observed, checking to see that Bernard had been moved far enough away to be out of earshot.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is often the way with old men,’ Godwyn said, with a sombre nod. ‘He has weathered a great many changes in his seventy winters, it cannot be easy.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If he continues to speak his mind as plainly among the undergraduates as he does among his fellows, he will soon go the way of his friend,’ said Slythurst, in a clipped tone that suggested he would not be displeased at such an outcome. I do not like to judge men on appearance and so little acquaintance, but there was something about the bursar that did not invite respect. He had been staring at me intently from the moment I sat down, and I sensed that the look was not friendly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘His friend?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">Coverdale sighed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is a sorry business, Doctor Bruno, and a source of shame to the college – the former sub-rector, Doctor Allen, was deprived of office last year after he was discovered to have …’ he hesitated, looking for a diplomatic expression ‘… perjured himself in swearing the Oath of Supremacy. It seemed he was still a devout communicant of the Roman Church.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Really? How was he discovered?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Denounced by an anonymous source,’ Coverdale said, as if relishing the intrigue. ‘But when his room was searched, he was found in possession of a quantity of banned papist literature. And of course the sub-rector holds the second highest office in the college, and is in charge whenever the rector is absent, so you may imagine the scandal. A number of us here had to testify against him in the Chancellor’s Court.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The university holds its own legal sessions to enforce discipline,’ explained Godwyn the librarian in a lugubrious tone. ‘Though in a matter of such import the Privy Council also took an active interest. The Earl of Leicester – our chancellor, you know – has repeatedly charged the heads of colleges to rid themselves of all suspicion of popery so the rector had to be seen to strike swift and hard against Allen.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Underhill was formerly the Earl of Leicester’s own chaplain, as he has no doubt boasted to you already,’ added Slythurst. ‘He could not have pardoned Allen and kept his own position.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yet Allen hoped for a pardon,’ Coverdale interjected. ‘And for better loyalty from his friends. In that he was badly disappointed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think the rector did his duty with a heavy heart, James,’ Godwyn said, with a meaningful look at Coverdale. ‘Indeed it grieved all of us to have to bear public witness to his errors.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Roger Mercer gave his testimony quickly enough,’ said Coverdale, glancing with barely concealed anger down the table to where Mercer was laughing merrily with Florio. I saw Slythurst roll his eyes, as if he had heard this grievance many times before. ‘And he was supposed to be Allen’s closest friend. Still, he got his thirty pieces of silver, did he not?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Silver?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘His testimony was crucial to condemning Allen, and for that he was given Allen’s position when he was deprived,’ Coverdale said bitterly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps I should clarify for Doctor Bruno that, traditionally, it is the proctor who succeeds as sub-rector, just as the sub-rector goes on to become rector,’ Godwyn explained. ‘This is the way it has always been done – there is a congregation of the Fellows, of course, but the vote is really a formal seal of approval on the established succession.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But since the present rector was placed here by the Earl of Leicester, to do his bidding,’ Coverdale hissed, hunching down in his seat so that he would not be heard, ‘he shows scant regard for tradition and appoints those he finds most pliable. And we all know why Leicester forced through Underhill’s election,’ he added significantly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘James,’ said Slythurst, a warning in his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I understood it was to enforce propriety in religion,’ I said. ‘Cut out the canker of popery.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, that is the official reason.’ Coverdale waved a dismissive hand. ‘But the college owns substantial manors and parcels of profitable farmland in Oxfordshire, you understand – many of which are now leased at a most advantageous rate to friends of Leicester, are they not, Master Bursar?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You forget yourself, James,’ Slythurst said smoothly. ‘Doctor Bruno here is a friend of the Earl of Leicester.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Indeed, I have never met him,’ I said hastily. ‘I merely travel with his nephew.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In any case,’ Coverdale continued, warming to his theme, ‘the college loses valuable profit and must struggle to make ends meet by admitting legions of these so-called gentlemen commoners – paying students who have neither the inclination nor the talent to be scholars and gad about the town wenching and gambling and bringing the university into disrepute.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘This is not an appropriate subject for the supper table,’ said Slythurst, in a voice thick with cold anger, bringing down his palm flat against the board just firmly enough to signal his displeasure. ‘There is nothing improper about those leases, moreover the disbursal of college funds can be of no interest to our guest. A little discretion, if you please, gentlemen.’</p>
<p class="indented">The Fellows looked down, embarrassed; an uncomfortable silence loomed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Coverdale,’ I said, turning to the proctor with a diplomatic smile, ‘you were telling me about the trial of Edmund Allen – please do go on.’</p>
<p class="indented">Coverdale exchanged a look with Slythurst that I could not read, then folded his hands together.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was saying only that Mercer’s testimony against Allen carried great weight in the trial, not least because he was Allen’s closest confidant. The rector needed Mercer’s cooperation, and in return he was given Allen’s position.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Which should have been yours,’ I prompted.</p>
<p class="indented">Coverdale placed a plump hand on his breast and assumed a face of unconvincing modesty.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is not for my own merits that I say an injustice has been done, Doctor Bruno,’ he said, ‘but for the violation to tradition. This university is founded on tradition, and if individuals feel that they are not obliged to respect it because their personal patronage carries more weight, the fabric of our community will crumble.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Edmund was friend to many of us,’ Godwyn said, with an air of regret. A sombre mood had fallen on our group as once again I heard Sophia, Florio and Mercer erupt into laughter. ‘He was greatly liked by the undergraduates, too – it was a pity that he could not in his heart renounce the errors of his old beliefs.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Exile seems a harsh punishment for owning a few books,’ I ventured, helping myself to more beef and onions.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He was lucky to leave England with his guts still inside his belly,’ said Slythurst dispassionately. ‘Less favoured men have had harder punishments for less. You of all people, Doctor Bruno, should know that heterodoxy in religion is a most grave sin, against God and the established order.’ He looked at me pointedly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was not just the books,’ Godwyn interrupted, in a confidential tone. ‘He was suspected of being a courier for his cousin, William Allen, at the English seminary in Rheims. They took him to London and questioned him under cruel torture, but he never said a word and in the end they sent him abroad. Poor Edmund.’ He shook his head sadly and drained his cup.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I met his son today,’ I remarked, tearing another piece of bread.</p>
<p class="indented">Coverdale rolled his eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then I pity you,’ he said. ‘No doubt he was begging you to carry pleas to the court for his father’s pardon?’ Without waiting for an answer, he clicked his tongue angrily. ‘That boy should never have been allowed to stay on after his father’s disgrace. Thomas Allen holds dangerous beliefs, mark my words. Though I could not persuade the rector to act on my advice – he is too soft-hearted with that boy.’</p>
<p class="indented">I could not help thinking that if the rector’s treatment of Thomas Allen was evidence of soft-heartedness, the boy’s life must be harsh indeed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Once again, it behoves me to say that I do not think our eminent guest has travelled all the way here to listen to us griping about college matters,’ Slythurst interrupted in a voice smooth as ice. He tucked a limp strand of hair behind his ear and turned to me, smiling with his teeth. ‘Tell us, Doctor Bruno, something of your travels in Europe. I understand you have taught at many of the famous academies across the continent. How do you find Oxford by comparison?’</p>
<p class="indented">Returning his smile with equal insincerity, for the remainder of that course, and the almond custard and jellied fruits that followed, I told them of my wandering years as the candles burned lower, leaving out what I thought politic and subtly flattering my new companions with what they wanted to hear – namely, that none of the European universities could hold a candle to the great scholarship and wisdom of the men of Oxford.</p>
<p class="indented">‘How long do you stay in Oxford, Doctor Bruno?’ asked Coverdale, sitting back in his chair and wiping his lips as the servants cleared away the last plates and cups.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I believe the palatine, in whose party I travel, intends to stay a week,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then I hope you will attend chapel with us here in the college. The rector is delivering a most erudite series of sermons on John Foxe’s <em class="calibre2">Acts and Monuments</em>, are you familiar with it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The <em class="calibre2">Book of Martyrs</em>? Naturally,’ I replied, suspecting that this was some sort of test. ‘Many consider it a most inspiring work.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno is not genuine in his admiration, I fear,’ said Slythurst, glancing from me to his colleagues. ‘I never met a Catholic yet who admired Foxe’s dreadful accounts of what was done to the Protestant martyrs.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does he not also give many examples of Christian martyrs from the earliest centuries of the faith, when Christians suffered at the hands of pagans and unbelievers, before we began persecuting one another?’ I replied. ‘And are these not martyrs whom all Christians may honour, and whose sufferings may remind us of a time when we lived in unity?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That was not Foxe’s intention,’ Slythurst began, but Coverdale interrupted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well said, Bruno. Believers on both sides have suffered for Christ, and only He knows who shall stand with Him at the Last Judgement.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is the first time I have ever heard <em class="calibre2">you</em> advocate tolerance, James,’ Slythurst said, his eyes narrowing even further. Coverdale ignored the provocation.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let us have some more wine here, ho!’ he cried to a serving boy, clapping his hands. I declined another glass, for I wanted to reflect on my notes for the disputation before I went to bed and needed to keep a clear head.</p>
<p class="indented">By the time the meal was over, it was fully dark outside the windows and the guests all rose, taking their leave with much handshaking and compliments to the rector on the food, which I understood had been greatly superior to the usual fare of the college hall supper. The Fellows all shook my hand warmly, repeating their welcome to Oxford and wishing me a good night’s rest in anticipation of the great disputation the following day, which they were all, they said, much looking forward to. Richard Godwyn invited me to make use of the library whenever I chose, for which I thanked him, John Florio expressed in perfect Italian his eager hopes that we might spend some time together before I left, and even Doctor Bernard rose unsteadily and clasped my fingers between his two bony hands.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Tomorrow night, Sorcerer,’ he hissed, with a toothless grin, ‘you will contradict their pious certainties, and I shall be there in the front row applauding you. Not because I support your heretical notions, but because I admire men who are not afraid. There are too few left in this place.’</p>
<p class="indented">Here he glanced pointedly at the rector, who affected not to notice. Only Slythurst did not trouble himself to express a welcome; he merely acknowledged me with a curt nod as he disappeared through the doorway, and only then because I caught him looking at me with those cold eyes. I felt again his dislike of me, though I tried not to view it as a personal slight; I noticed that he left without saying goodnight to his colleagues either, and surmised that he was one of those men, common enough among academics, who was simply not blessed with an easy social manner.</p>
<p class="indented">When I said goodnight to Sophia, she extended her hand demurely and I kissed it respectfully under her father’s watchful eye, but he was then distracted by Doctor Bernard loudly fretting about where he had left his coat, and while the rector was reassuring Bernard that he had not brought any coat, Sophia leaned close to me and laid a hand on my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno, I should very much like to continue our earlier conversation – you remember? The book of Agrippa? Perhaps when the disputation is over, you may have more leisure to talk. I can often be found in the college library,’ she added. ‘My father allows me to read there in the mornings and the early evenings, when most of the scholars are attending lectures and disputations.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So that you do not distract them from their books?’ I whispered back. She blushed, and gave me a knowing smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you will come? There is much I would ask you.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">She looked up at me with a surprising urgency in her eyes, her hand lingering on my arm; I nodded briefly as her father appeared at her shoulder and looked at me enquiringly. I shook his hand, thanked him for the meal and bade the company good night.</p>
<p class="flush-left">I was glad to emerge into the cool of the passageway; the rain had stopped and the night air smelled fresh and inviting after the heavy warmth of the rector’s lodgings. I thought I might walk in the orchard garden to clear my head and digest before retiring, but before I reached the end of the passageway I realised that the iron gate had been closed. When I tried the ring set as a handle, I found it was firmly locked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno!’ called a voice behind me, and I turned to see Roger Mercer standing at the other end of the passage, by the rector’s door. He took a few paces towards me. ‘You wished to take a turn in the Grove?’ He gestured towards the closed gate.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is this not permitted?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Grove is for the use of the Fellows only,’ he said, ‘and only we and the rector have keys. It is kept locked at night, for fear the undergraduates would make use of it for all manner of improper trysts. No doubt they find alternative places, if they can slip past the main gate,’ he added with an indulgent smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They are not allowed out of the college at night?’ I asked. ‘That does seem a hard confinement on men in the prime of youth.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is meant to teach them self-discipline,’ Mercer said. ‘Most of them find ways around the rules, though – I know I did at their age.’ He chuckled. ‘Cobbett the porter is a good old man, he’s been here for years, but he is willing to look the other way for a few coins if the young ones come back from town after the gates are locked. He likes a drink, too, Cobbett – sometimes I think he conveniently forgets to lock the gate altogether.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does the rector not discipline him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The rector is severe in some matters, but in others he shows a shrewd understanding of how best to manage a community of young men. A rod of iron is not always the wisest course – sometimes good leadership is a matter of knowing when to turn a blind eye. Young men will go to taverns and whorehouses whether we like it or no, and the greater the force used in prohibition, the greater the allure.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘As Doctor Bernard said about forbidden books,’ I mused.</p>
<p class="indented">Mercer glanced at me sideways as we emerged from the other end of the passage into the open courtyard, where the clock on the north range proclaimed the hour to be almost nine.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You must excuse Doctor Bernard some of his harshness,’ he said, apologetically. ‘He has had to change his religion three times under four different sovereigns. He was ordained priest in his youth, you know, before the queen’s father broke with Rome. But he grows more and more outspoken of late, and I begin to suspect that he suffers that affliction of old men, where he is sometimes lost in memory and not clear to whom he speaks.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He seemed lucid enough to me. But angry.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes.’ Mercer sighed. ‘He is angry – at the world, the university, at what has been demanded of him and at himself for what he has done. And you must be wondering at his anger towards me.’ He glanced at me again, almost timid.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He spoke bitterly of exile.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He meant the trouble last year over our sub-rector, Edmund Allen, I expect you have heard. William was close to him, as was I, but I was obliged to testify against him to the Chancellor’s Court for certain matters regarding his religious practices. William considers this an unforgivable betrayal.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you?’ I asked softly.</p>
<p class="indented">Mercer gave a small, bitter laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I acted according to my duty and to save my skin, and now I have the sub-rector’s gown and his well-appointed room in the tower. William was right. I betrayed a friend. But I had no choice, and neither did he. You see the life we have here, Bruno?’ He gestured at the windows of the rector’s lodgings, still glowing with amber light from the candles. ‘It is a good life, a comfortable life for a scholar – we are sheltered in many ways from the world. And I – I am not fitted for any work but the life of books and learning, I lack the worldly ambition to push myself forward. If I had not publicly condemned my friend for his perfidy in religion, I would have shared his fate and lost everything. And at that point his fate was not known – the Privy Council allowed the university to conduct his trial, but there was every chance the matter would be handed to them and Edmund might have been facing a worse punishment than exile.’ He shuddered. ‘So I am not proud of my actions, no, but William Bernard has no right to rail against me. When Her Majesty took the throne and ended her sister Mary’s brief reconciliation with Rome, there was a great purge in the university – all the Catholic Fellows and heads of colleges appointed by Mary were deprived of office unless they renounced the pope’s authority and swore the Oath of Supremacy. William swore it quickly enough, and that oath bought him twenty-five peaceful years in this place, while his more steadfast friends were scattered to the four winds.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And yet, in the winter of his life, it seems clear enough to anyone listening that his heart returns to the old faith.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think, as he nears death, he grows less concerned with the fate of his body and more fearful for his soul,’ Mercer said. ‘Perhaps if we all saw our death so close at hand, we might choose a different course, but alas, while we breathe our fears are all for our poor, weak flesh and our worldly status.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps so. But it is the son who seems to suffer it most,’ I observed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have met Thomas? That poor boy. He is a very able scholar, you know. At least, he was.’ Mercer ran both hands over his face as if washing it, a gesture of hopelessness. ‘I have known him since he first came to Oxford at fifteen – before his father left for Rheims, he charged me to care for Thomas like a father in his absence. Edmund understood why I had to act as I did – he forgave me. But Thomas will not forgive me for my part in Edmund’s trial. I have tried to help him – with such gifts of money as are in my power, I mean – but he would rather humiliate himself slaving for that young peacock Norris than accept a penny. When I pass him in the courtyard he does not even acknowledge me, but I feel the hatred burning in him like a furnace.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is hard,’ I said. ‘But he is young, and the passions of the young are often as brief as they are fierce. Perhaps he will forgive you in time.’</p>
<p class="indented">I bowed then and moved towards my staircase, keen to get to work before the hour grew too late. Mercer stepped towards me and grasped my hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I hope we will have a chance to talk further, Doctor Bruno,’ he said. ‘I am truly glad to have met you, and I hope I did not sound too sanctimonious in my disapproval this evening when we spoke of Agrippa and the Hermetic treatises.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I am quite used to disapproval,’ I said, waving away his apology with a smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You mistake my meaning. The rector is a pious man and, as I say, he can be severe when he chooses – it is prudent for those whose position depends on his good opinion to express views that accord with his own when at his table. But I have long had a great interest in these works – as a scholar, I mean, for I believe that one can study the occult philosophies objectively yet still remain a good Christian. Is it not so, Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ficino thought so,’ I replied. ‘And I hope he was right, Doctor Mercer, else I am damned.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Please – call me Roger,’ he said warmly. ‘Well, I shall look forward to our next discussion on these matters.’</p>
<p class="indented">With that, he bowed and strode away across the courtyard. I turned towards my room just as fat drops of rain began once more to fall from a brooding sky.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter002" class="calibre4">TWO</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">I hurried back towards the Porte Saint-Victor through a veil of fine rain as dusk fell, keen to disappear into the warren of narrow streets around the colleges on the Left Bank before anyone noticed I had gone. In the commotion after Paul’s death I had slipped away from the abbey, knowing they would call in the city authorities; life may be cheap in Paris in these turbulent times, but the murder of a priest was still a serious matter, particularly one with Paul’s connections, and I did not want to find myself caught up in their investigation. The friars had asked me, of course, what his urgent last word had been; I told them ‘Jesus’. I don’t know if they believed me. I was not sure what instinct prompted me to lie; only that it seemed prudent not to divulge anything to people I did not know, especially those in holy orders. Paris was so fractured by divided loyalties that the wrong word to the wrong person could ripple outwards with unintended consequences, and my position was too precarious to place myself knowingly at the heart of a political murder – for it seemed to me that Albaric’s first surmise had been correct, that the attack was a direct result of Paul’s eloquent rant against the decadence and corruption of the royal House of Valois from his pulpit the previous Sunday.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Circe’, I supposed, must be some kind of code word, intelligible perhaps to his confederates in the Catholic League, but I had no idea what it might mean, or what might be unleashed by repeating it in the wrong ear. Could it be connected to the identity of his killer? Was that what he was trying to tell me? I was not convinced that Paul had even been aware of who I was at the end. Best to keep silent until I could seek the advice of Jacopo Corbinelli, the only man in Paris I dared to trust. Like me, Jacopo was a scholar, an Italian in exile, part of the Florentine entourage that surrounded Catherine de Medici, the widowed Queen Mother. He had been King Henri’s boyhood tutor and continued to serve him as advisor and keeper of his library, though he also remained Catherine’s secretary, and as such he was uniquely placed to speak in my favour at court. He had taken me under his wing when I arrived in Paris for the first time, four years ago; it was he who had heard me give a lecture on my art of memory at the University and recommended me to the King. I became a regular guest among the Italian thinkers, writers and artists who gathered around Jacopo’s supper table in those days and I had hoped, on returning from London, that I might renew the friendship and enjoy again the warmth of that company. But affairs of state kept him busy now between the palaces, or so he told me; I had seen him only twice since I arrived at the beginning of September, and though he had assured me he would persuade the King to grant me an audience, I was still waiting for a word, and it was now almost a month since I had heard anything from him. I decided to send another message to his house and ask to see him urgently. Until then, I would keep my mouth shut regarding Paul’s murder; too much about it made me uneasy.</p>
<p class="indented">On impulse, I turned north towards the river before I reached the gate, in the direction of the old fort of La Tournelle which stood a squat sentinel over the Seine and its islands, marking the boundary of the city wall. Here, Paris ended abruptly, bustling streets giving way to ploughed fields and orchards, wide unpaved roads built for ox-carts and canals for goods barges from the surrounding farms – all the arteries that kept money flowing in and out of the city. Huddled in the shadow of the old wall, the Faubourg Saint-Victor offered little to passing visitors besides the great abbey that gave the district its name; only a few scattered cottages and cheap inns along the main road out of the city. Mudbanks sloped down to the river, pockmarked with the tracks of gulls; rickety wooden jetties splayed into the water at intervals, their boards slick with weed and splintered like rotten teeth. I walked slowly back along the bank where the inland channel met the broad expanse of the river, scanning the ground to either side. With that head wound, Paul would not have survived more than a few minutes in the water. The current must have washed him into the shallows of the inlet and on to the bank almost as soon as he was thrown in or he would have drowned, which meant he must have been struck just upriver from the channel – in other words, right under the wall of the abbey. It was hard to imagine that Paul would have had any other destination in this part of town; it was reasonable to assume, too, given that he had asked for me by name on his deathbed, that he had come to the abbey looking for me. But someone else had encountered him first.</p>
<p class="indented">A wooden bridge crossed the channel, leading directly to the narrow track that passed along the bank at the back wall of the abbey grounds. A few yards further along I found what I was looking for: a patch of churned-up mud, the dark blotch of bloodstains almost invisible now in the fading light against the wet ground. If the rain continued, they would be gone by morning. A chaos of footprints led away from the scene in all directions; though I could see an imprint that might have indicated where a body was dragged to the water’s edge, it was impossible to see where the tracks led after that. Even so, this scene undermined Albaric’s other theory of street robbers; the route for traders passed in front of the abbey’s main gates. No bandit who knew his business would bother lurking on this isolated path in the hope of grabbing a farmer with a fat purse.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned slowly, surveying both sides of the river. Only yards from the trampled spot where Paul must have been attacked I noticed a low door set into the boundary wall of the abbey; below it, a set of stone steps leading down to the water, with a rusted iron ring for tethering a boat. I tried the handle of the door but it was locked fast. There was no other living soul stirring out here in the gathering dusk, save a heron flapping its stately line across the row of clouds; at my back the river flowed on, grey and implacable, while beyond the wall, the grand spire of the abbey church and a few plumes of smoke from the cottages stood out against the darkening sky. A lonely place, but in daylight there would be enough traffic on the river to mean that anyone standing here would be visible to passing boatmen. The killer had taken a risk; Paul’s death had been a matter of urgency, then. Had his attacker followed him from his lodgings, watching for an opportunity once he realised his target was leaving the city? Or was he already waiting, knowing that Paul would come to the abbey this afternoon?</p>
<p class="indented">A staccato exchange between oarsmen out on the river drifted across on the breeze. I turned and watched as two pinpoints of light wavered towards one another, accompanied by the slow splashing of oars. A gust of laughter rippled out as the wherries passed. The boatmen who found Paul must have missed the killer by a matter of minutes; perhaps their arrival had caused him to take flight before the job was finished. It would not be impossible to track down those men and question them, though I supposed that if they had had anything to tell, they would have mentioned it to the friars. It was also likely that they had gone through the injured man’s clothes in search of valuables before they realised he was still breathing; life was hard for everyone now in Paris, and even honest men were desperate. If they had found anything worth taking, they would not want to answer questions. I could not help thinking – and it was not a thought which did me credit – that if they had only arrived a few minutes later, he would not have been alive to say my name, and I would not have been the one to hear him rasp out his gnomic last word. My life in Paris was dangerous enough without involving myself in a factional murder and I had an uneasy sense that, with his dying breath, Paul had handed me a thread that would, at the slightest tweak, unravel a mystery better left untouched.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">I glanced back at the wall as a new thought occurred; anyone with a key to that door could easily attack a man, push him in the water and disappear again inside the abbey in a matter of minutes. I kicked over the dark stains in the mud and turned towards home.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">The gutters along each side of the rue du Cimetière already trickled steadily with the run-off from the roofs, though the rain remained thin and half-hearted. I tilted my head back to look up at the strip of sky between the crooked eaves of houses that leaned in toward one another across the narrow street, like drunks about to fall into each other’s arms. Paris was decaying; the years of religious strife had left no money for the upkeep of the streets, where refuse, ashes and shit of every kind banked up around potholes deep enough to break the legs of horses, while the fabric of the crowded medieval <em class="calibre6">quartiers</em> crumbled around their tenants, who had long ago resigned themselves to cold and foul smells and the ever-present threat of plague. It was a depressing place to take lodgings, inhabited almost entirely by the poorer students from the nearby Sorbonne and the Collège de France, but I had little choice since my return from London unless King Henri was willing to take me back under his patronage, and with France on the brink of civil war, it seemed he had more pressing matters on his mind than the circumstances of one exiled Italian heretic he had once called a friend.</p>
<p class="indented">Hunger, and the desire to delay the gloomy prospect of returning to my rooms alone, drove me to the Swan and Cross at the end of the street, a noisy, amiable tavern where groups of students gathered after the day’s lectures to argue philosophy and politics over a jug of cheap wine and exchange flirtatious insults with the working girls they could not afford. The air inside was thick with a fug of wet wool, roasting meat, tobacco and male sweat, but I was glad of the warmth. I turned at the sound of a whistle, to see a round-faced, cheerful whore I vaguely recognised by sight, perched sideways on a boy’s lap and winking at me while he chatted to his friends as if he had not noticed her.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is it my lucky night tonight, Doctor? You look wet through. Let me warm you up.’</p>
<p class="indented">I offered a mock bow. ‘Forgive me, mademoiselle, but I’m afraid I’m not stopping.’</p>
<p class="indented">She pouted her rouged lips and squeezed her arms together to push up her breasts so that they threatened to spill over her tight bodice. ‘You always say that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Because I am always busy. Besides, you have company.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Pfft.’ She waved a hand over the boy’s head. ‘Can’t be good for you. A man needs pleasure in his life, Doctor. Too much of this—’ she tapped the side of her head – ‘and not enough of this—’ she grabbed at her crotch, an exaggerated, masculine gesture. ‘Makes you ill. That’s why you’re getting thin.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You could be right,’ I said, almost smiling as I edged by. ‘Maybe next time.’</p>
<p class="indented">She slapped me on the backside as I passed. ‘Well, I won’t wait around for ever. <em class="calibre6">Carpe diem</em>, Doctor.’</p>
<p class="indented">I raised an eyebrow and she grinned.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I see you’ve got some Latin out of these students.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s about all I get out of them and their moth-eaten purses, stingy little ballsacks.’ She leaned over the shoulder of the boy she was sitting on and drank deep from his beaker of wine; I took advantage of the outcry to slip through the crowd. I could not afford the girls either, though they did not know this; they looked at me and saw well-cut clothes – good leather boots, black wool breeches and a short doublet of black leather with puffed shoulders, tailored in London in the days when I had a little money to spare, and carefully mended since – assumed an income to match and badgered me accordingly. Not that I was tempted by this one or any of her colleagues; still, I found her diagnosis depressingly accurate.</p>
<p class="indented">Gaston, the square-shouldered proprietor, appeared out of the fray as he always did, with the lock-jawed expression of a pikeman facing down a foe. When he caught sight of me, he elbowed his way through his customers without ceremony, wiping his hands on his apron and holding them out as if I were a nephew returned from a distant war. I submitted to his embrace as he wrapped me in his familiar smell of garlic and cooking fat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gaston,’ I said, finally disentangling myself, ‘do you remember a young theologian called Paul Lefèvre, used to come in here three years back when he was at the Sorbonne? Skinny fellow, reedy voice.’</p>
<p class="indented">Gaston squeezed his eyes shut and cocked his head to one side, as if listening for the answer. ‘That was the lad who went to be priest at Saint-Séverin, no? Adam’s apple like a snake swallowing a rat?’ He tugged the flesh of his neck out to illustrate the point.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s him. He used to take rooms on the rue Macon – do you know if he still had them?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Had?’ His eyebrow shot up; no sharper eyes or ears on the Left Bank than Gaston’s, so they said. ‘Why, what’s happened to him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I mean – since I’ve been away,’ I corrected, quickly. I needed to act before Paul’s murder became common knowledge. ‘Was he still living there?’</p>
<p class="indented">He shrugged. ‘Far as I know. We haven’t seen him here for a long time – too holy for the likes of us now.’ He gave a throaty chuckle. ‘I remember him all right – used to sit there on the edge of the group as if he wanted the courage to throw himself into the conversation. Everyone always talked over him. You know he joined the League? Maybe he got more respect from them.’ He sucked in his fleshy cheeks to show what he thought of that. ‘He stopped coming in here after he was ordained priest – this would be after you’d gone to England, Signor Bruno. Turned into quite the hellfire preacher, you know, inflaming his congregation against the King and his appointed heir. Me and the wife changed church because of it, must have been a year back. I don’t go to Mass for a bellyful of politics. Mind you—’ he paused to draw breath, raising a forefinger like a schoolmaster – ‘I’m not saying I’d be happy to see some whoreson Protestant wearing the crown of France, but you have to respect—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thanks, Gaston. I have to go now,’ I said, patting him on the chest as I turned for the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Got any money for me?’ He made it sound good-humoured, but I was stung by guilt; he had given me too many suppers on credit lately, and the bill was mounting.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will have it for you very soon, I swear. I just need to – get my affairs in order. Any day now.’ By which I meant, whenever the King deigns to send for me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah, I’m only messing, lad – go on, what’ll you have? Put some meat on your bones. You look hungry.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you – perhaps later.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You say that to all the girls,’ he called after me as I ducked between wildly gesturing students to escape, smiling to myself at the way he still thought of me as one of his boys, though at thirty-seven I was probably only a few years behind him. At least the whores and publicans of Paris were pleased to see me back.</p>
<p class="indented">The buildings took on a greyish pallor in the deepening shadows as the rain fell harder. The days were shortening towards midwinter; when the sky was overcast it felt as if night was falling by early afternoon. I wrapped my cloak around my shoulders and pulled the hood close to hide my face as I trudged back towards the river through rutted streets ankle-deep in filth. At the corner of rue Saint-Jacques, I felt a hand reach out and clutch at my sleeve; I whipped around, dagger half-drawn, but it was only a beggar-child, filthy and hollow-cheeked, with staring eyes. I would have thrown him a coin, but he caught sight of the knife and streaked away into an impossible gap between two houses quick as a fish. Paris was full of the dispossessed now; that was another change for the worse. Failing harvests and the constant three-way skirmishes between the Protestant Huguenot forces, the beleaguered royal armies and the swelling numbers of Catholic League troops further south had driven bedraggled flocks of refugees towards the capital, where they begged, stole, sold themselves, or starved to death on the streets.</p>
<p class="indented">It was growing harder to resist the melancholy that had crept over me since my enforced return from London. In Paris, as the chill and dark of autumn edged towards winter, I had begun to experience a gnawing homesickness for the blue skies and green slopes of my native Nola, at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, made keener by the knowledge that I might never return. For perhaps the first time since I had abandoned the religious life nine years ago, I was truly coming to understand what exile meant. This rootlessness – living out of a travelling bag, arriving in every town with one eye on the road out – no longer felt like freedom. Now, more than ever, it felt like the reverse. I had thought, for a while, that I might come to call London home, but that did not work out as I had hoped. I had left behind the few people I thought of as friends, and arrived in Paris to find those who had once opened their doors to me turning away, embarrassed. My reputation was becoming a problem, one I entrenched further with each new book I wilfully published. Though every fibre of my being bridled at the forced humiliation, I had no choice but to beg to have this excommunication lifted. At twenty-eight, I had worn it as the proud badge of a free-thinker. Now, at thirty-seven, I was obliged to view it in a different light: as an impediment to any offer of patronage. A man like me could not live without a patron, and no Catholic with a care for his honour will sponsor a known heretic; it was for this alone that I had approached Paul. For now, I belonged nowhere, and it was hard to shake that sense of exclusion.</p>
<p class="indented">I clenched my teeth and sheathed my dagger: no more of that. Courage, Bruno, I told myself, as I walked on towards the rue Macon. You have been in worse straits than this and talked your way out and up; you can do so again. I needed to see Jacopo Corbinelli. But first, I had to make sure I could not be further connected with Paul Lefèvre. If he had been carrying letters, they must have been taken from him before he was thrown in the river, but his lodgings would certainly be searched; if there was any correspondence that mentioned me or the favour I had asked of him, I wanted to be the one to find it. I knew too well how it might be used against me. There were those among the extreme Catholic faction here in Paris who knew, or guessed at, my activities in England. If they thought I desired the Church’s goodwill again, they would not miss the chance to use it as leverage. Reconciliation in exchange for information – and that was a bargain I was not prepared to strike. I still felt some loyalty to England, even if she appeared to have forgotten me. Beyond that, I had no intention of involving myself in Paul’s murder. We had been acquaintances, not friends; I was sorry that he had met such a brutal death, but he would have known he was courting danger when he decided to tangle with religious politics. Besides, I had a good idea that the cynical Frère Albaric had not been far wrong in his surmise about the Louvre, and that was a truth I preferred to leave for others to uncover.</p>
<p class="indented">Halfway along rue Macon I met a young woman with a basket of laundry sheltering in a doorway; after we had exchanged complaints about the weather, she confirmed that Père Lefèvre did indeed have rooms in a house opposite, on the first floor. I considered knocking to see if one of his neighbours would let me in, but there were no lights visible in the rest of the house, and it seemed wise to keep my visit discreet. A little careful tinkering with the blade of my knife, and the cheap lock of the front door yielded without much resistance. I latched it behind me, so that I would at least have some warning if someone else had the same idea.</p>
<p class="indented">It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the gloom of the entrance hall, and I wished I had thought to bring a tinder-box and taper. On my left, a crooked staircase ran up to the first floor; after listening for any tell-tale sound of movement from other rooms, I climbed as carefully as I could, though it was impossible to stop the old boards from groaning in protest. My stomach let out a low growl and I clamped a hand across it as if that might muffle the sound; I regretted turning down Gaston’s offer of supper. The door to Paul’s rooms was also locked, and took longer to tease into compliance; this lock appeared newly fitted, and was of a more sturdy and sophisticated type than the rusted bolt downstairs. Had he installed it out of fear for his own safety, I wondered, or to protect some item of value inside? My fingers had grown stiff with cold; I breathed on them and reminded myself to be patient – a steady hand was vital in the series of minute movements required to persuade a lock to yield without a key. Too much haste and you would break the mechanism or slice your fingers. A strange skill for a philosopher, my friend Philip Sidney used to say, though always in a tone of admiration – but then Sidney found it hard to imagine the life I had led before I met him. As the son of a noble family, he had been taught to duel as a boy by a celebrated fencing master; I had learned to fight with my fists on the streets of Naples. I picked up additional skills not usually taught to Dominican friars during the two years I spent on the road north through Italy after I abandoned my order: passing nights in barns, or in taverns where men will put a knife in your ribs for a heel of bread, you learn to shift for yourself however you can. My fellow travellers in those years were not aristocrats and poets but criminals, charlatans and itinerants: strolling players, card sharps, defrocked priests, pedlars, jongleurs, whores and heretics. They knew a few tricks about how to survive, and were generous enough to pass them on. I thanked them silently as the lock finally submitted to the point of my knife with a gratifying click.</p>
<p class="indented">Paul had liked his surroundings austere; I almost smiled at the painstaking self-denial in evidence as I closed the door behind me. The room smelled of woodsmoke, damp and that stale odour of unwashed clothes that often clings to bachelors. I felt a stab of pity for him; he had allowed himself so little joy in his determination to please God, and look what it had brought him. Perhaps that was the saddest aspect of his death; he had never been a man who cared much for worldly advancement. If he had joined the Catholic League – those hardline religious conservatives determined to restore the purity of the Church, at any cost – it would have been from a genuine zeal to purge France of all that was unholy. Mind you, that was what the Inquisition in my country liked to claim too.</p>
<p class="indented">The main room contained only a wide desk under the window and a carved chest, of the kind used to store linen, in the opposite corner. The desk held an inkhorn, a pot containing three quills, a block of sealing wax and a small penknife; to the left of the inkhorn sat a rectangular wooden box, about a foot and a half long and half as much wide, its surface inlaid with intricate patterns in mother-of-pearl and ivory and fastened with a padlock. A mournful Virgin holding an infant with the face of an irascible old man hung on the wall opposite the window. The adjoining room was partitioned off by a curtain, which I drew back to reveal a space that hardly deserved to be called a bedchamber; more an alcove barely wide enough to hold a single bed. There was another, smaller casement here; I peered out to see that it opened on to the yard side of the house, where part of the ground floor jutted out in a sloping roof directly below the window. Above the bed Paul had fixed a heavy crucifix, with a tortured Christ gazing reproachfully, his neck twisted down to one side so that, if you were supine with your head on the pillow, his wounded eyes would stare right into you. <em class="calibre6">Dio porco</em>; imagine waking to that sight every morning. I knelt to look under the bed; at first I could only make out a chamber pot and some unidentified shape among drifts of dust. I stretched in, groping towards it until my fingers touched the edge of a wooden casket. I drew it out to find it was secured with a sturdy iron padlock. The keyhole was too small to accommodate the blade of my knife; I cast around the room in search of an alternative, but the best I could do was a poker in the fireplace, with which I forced the padlock until it snapped open and a collection of small items wrapped in cloth tumbled out on to the boards. I picked one up, intrigued; it was tied around with twine and gave off a faint odour of decay and alcohol. I unwrapped the bindings and dropped the object immediately, smothering a cry of disgust as I realised I was looking at a severed human finger, seemingly pickled to preserve it, though with dubious success. The flesh was blackened, the torn end of bone and sinew ragged and stringy. Why had Paul hidden such a thing? I tried to refold it in its cloth wrapping when I noticed a tiny paper label attached to the string. It read ‘A. Briant’. The name sounded familiar; I searched the index of my memory as I replaced it in the box and picked up another bundle. This one rattled lightly; scrawled on its label was the name ‘E. Campion’. Already guessing what I would find, I untied it gingerly and tipped the contents into my palm, wincing as I looked at a handful of bloody teeth. The name Campion had sprung the lock of my memory; Father Edmund Campion had been a Jesuit missionary to England, caught and executed for treason four years ago by Queen Elizabeth’s government. Alexander Briant was one of the missionary priests executed with him. It seemed Paul had been collecting relics of English martyrs, items highly prized by the English Catholic exiles in Paris, though the trade was illegal. I wrapped the teeth again, intending to push the whole grisly box back where I had found it, when the label of another packet caught my eye. I lifted it and read ‘J. Gifford’. My stomach clenched as I untied the string holding it; the cloth weighed almost nothing. Inside was a lock of blond hair, matted with dried blood. I had known an English priest by the name of Gifford once; I had watched him die. It seemed a lifetime ago. The bloodied hair lay in the palm of my hand like a reproach, or a warning. I shivered. Whatever Paul was involved in was not my business; I needed to find what I came for and get as far away as possible. I had been too close to too many deaths, these past few years. I shoved the box back into the shadows under the bed and turned my attention to the desk.</p>
<p class="indented">The padlock on the ornamental casket proved easy enough to force; the lid opened to reveal a pile of papers, as I had supposed. I took out the first sheet; it was folded in half to make a pamphlet, and on the front was handwritten ‘THE KING OF SODOM’ in strident capitals. Beneath this headline was a crude sketch of a crowned and bearded figure bent double and wearing women’s clothes, which he had hitched up to his waist to allow another man to take him from behind while wielding a flagellant’s whip. I opened the paper; inside was a polemic against the licentiousness of the court, explaining in lurid detail that King Henri III of France could not get an heir because he wouldn’t take his prick out of the Duke d’Epernon’s arse for long enough. I turned the paper back to look at the drawing. I recognised the style, but the version I had seen before was typeset and printed with a woodcut; one of the many anonymous handbills sold for a sou, thrust at you in the square outside Notre Dame by men who took care to keep their faces covered. You could find these pamphlets, discarded, blowing along the gutter near the colleges on the Left Bank. Even a cursory glance at this draft was enough to see that the author had conflicted feelings about the acts he described with such pious outrage; he had worked himself into such a pitch of righteous fury that in places his pen had scored right through the paper, yet it was impossible to disguise the relish in his lingering and explicit account of what the King and his <em class="calibre6">mignons</em> – those louche young nobles who hung about the court to fawn on him – were supposed to get up to in the royal bedchamber. Poor Paul, I thought again, if this were his work.</p>
<p class="indented">I lifted out the next paper to find another handwritten draft. The headline on the cover of this one ran: ‘An Account of the Most Glorious Achievements and Military Successes of Our Great King Henri III’. Inside, the page was left blank, except for one word in minute letters at the bottom: <em class="calibre6">Rien.</em> I had to bite back a laugh; it seemed Paul had possessed a sense of humour after all. This one would have wounded the King far more than any number of drawings of him being mounted by his friends; he had always enjoyed courting notoriety but he could not bear to be thought a failure. It did not surprise me to find that Paul had been providing the copy for inflammatory handbills, given his affiliation with the Catholic League – though I had to wonder why he had kept these incriminating drafts, knowing that the punishment for printing or distributing such libel against the King was execution. I replaced the papers in the box. Perhaps that was exactly what had happened, but without the courtesy of a trial.</p>
<p class="indented">A sound from below – a shout, a door slamming – jolted me from my thoughts. I paused, straining to hear, right hand moving instinctively towards my dagger, until I was satisfied that the sound had come from outside. I moved to the window and peered down, keeping to one side so that I would not be seen, but the street appeared to be empty. Again, I caught a faint smell of woodsmoke and glanced across to the small hearth opposite, where the remnants of a meagre fire lay cold in the grate. Paul had not given any indication during our brief conversation in the confessional that he believed himself to be in danger. Rather, he had spoken with the self-congratulating assurance of someone who considered himself favoured by the rising power. He had even hinted that the King was soon to fall. I wondered if he had had time to recognise his assailant before the blow struck, and whether the killer had waited around to see the bargemen pull him out of the water, or knew that he had been taken to the abbey. It would not take long before my presence at his deathbed leaked out; if that became known to whoever had wanted him dead, that person may fear I knew more than I should.</p>
<p class="indented">I picked up the poker and prodded the pile of ashes in the fireplace, jumping back as a sudden shower of sparks burst forth from a smouldering ember. The room was cold, yet it seemed Paul had lit a fire here recently; so small, to judge by the remnants, that it hardly seemed worth the trouble for the warmth it would offer. Two or more hours must have passed since the bargemen had brought him to the abbey; perhaps three, then, since he closed the door to these rooms for the final time, leaving the embers to burn themselves out. I crouched and poked further among the ashes, my pulse quickening as I uncovered a few blackened scraps, curling like charred leaves. So he had been burning papers. I hardly dared hope that anything legible might have survived, but I combed further through the cinders and at the very back of the hearth, where a draught must have blown it out of the flames’ reach, I spotted a fragment that still showed patches of discoloured writing.</p>
<p class="indented">I drew it out and held it between thumb and forefinger, the edges falling away to dust as I lifted it closer to my face, barely breathing lest it disintegrate. Only a few words remained visible between the scorch marks, written in a strong, flowing hand. ‘… <em class="calibre6">to violate the sanctity of the confessional</em>’, read one line, the remainder of the sentence blackened beyond recognition. ‘… <em class="calibre6">wrestled with my conscience</em> …’ was visible in the line below. Followed by this: <em class="calibre6">‘… what harm Circe intends you’</em>; a gap, scorched away, then ‘… <em class="calibre6">may God forgive me</em>’. The only other words I could make out with any certainty were those which caused my chest to tighten: ‘<em class="calibre6">Votre Majesté</em>’.</p>
<p class="indented">I stood, still pinching the scrap of paper, steadying myself as the blood pounded in my ears and my mind raced to make sense of these shreds. The first thing that struck me was that the hand was different from the pamphlets I had seen in the box, suggesting that one or the other was not written by Paul – unless he had taken the trouble to disguise his writing significantly, which was possible if he did not want to be associated with the libellous handbills. The reference to the confessional suggested that Paul was the author of the letter, and that he was trying to warn the King of some danger to him from whoever or whatever Circe may be. But why burn it? Perhaps he had had second thoughts about the risk to himself – to break the sacrament of confession would mean the end of his priesthood, not to mention the jeopardy to his immortal soul – or else he had already sent a more polished draft and wished to destroy any possibility of tracing it back to him. I tucked the brittle paper into the pocket sewn into the lining of my doublet; I doubted it would survive, but instinct told me I should keep hold of it. Paul had tried to burn this letter, shortly before he was killed; it was hard to believe the two were unconnected.</p>
<p class="indented">If Paul had been destroying incriminating documents, perhaps there were more stashed away in the box on the desk. I returned to it, but as I reached for the papers I caught again the sound of a door creaking and closing, softer but definitely inside this time, and below me. I held my breath and heard the unmistakable tread of feet on the stairs; two pairs, and a muffled exchange in lowered voices. I closed the lid of the box and retreated as silently as I could into the alcove with the bed, pulling the curtain tightly across.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Unlocked. I don’t like that.’ The speaker’s voice was curiously throttled, as if it were trapped at the back of his throat. He rattled the latch and I heard the door close behind them.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps he was in a hurry.’ His companion’s voice was cultivated, Parisian. There was a sliver of a gap between the curtain and the wall. I edged closer to see if I could glimpse them.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You think he’d leave his door open for all-comers?’ The first man clicked his tongue; the boards squeaked as he paced around the room. His movements sounded off-kilter, as if he walked with a lurching gait. Lame, perhaps. That might make things easier. I eased the catch of the casement free, as quietly as I could. ‘Not he. Someone’s got here first.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who? Who could possibly know—’ The other broke off suddenly; I felt the stillness of them, alert, breath held, only feet away. The faint sound of a board underfoot; the whisper of a weapon drawn from its sheath. One error of judgement here and I would find myself as skewered as Saint Teresa. I sensed them hesitate, deliberating where to strike – just long enough for me to push open the window and roll out at the exact moment a sword’s point thrust through the curtain and buried itself deep in the straw mattress where I had been crouching.</p>
<p class="indented">I hit the protruding roof of the ground floor at an awkward angle, but dug my heels in enough to slow my fall, so that I was able to clutch at the edge and drop to the ground with a degree of control. A furious cry echoed from the window above, but I did not look up; instead I pulled my hood around my face, brushed myself down – bruises, nothing broken – and scrambled over the back fence into an alley. They would come looking for me in a few minutes and there were two of them, even if one was lame. I glanced left and right: a dead end, the only way out would take me into the street that ran perpendicular to the rue Macon. If I ran towards the river, I might be able to hide along the quay, but if they found me there, I would be trapped, and the dark water and deserted riverbank would be a gift to my pursuers. But if I tried to flee south, I would run straight into them as they turned the corner. I hesitated at the mouth of the alley, expecting to see them at any moment, when I noticed the laundress I had spoken to earlier unlocking the door of a house opposite. I hurtled up behind her just as she was about to close it; she gave a little scream and tried to slam the door in my face, evidently thinking she was about to be attacked, but I was too quick and jammed my boot into the gap.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Catholic or Protestant?’ I demanded, pointing at her.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Don’t be alarmed, madame,’ I hissed, cutting a glance over my shoulder. ‘Are you Catholic or Protestant?’</p>
<p class="indented">She looked affronted. ‘Catholic, of course.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘God be praised. There are two Huguenots after me. In the name of the Blessed Virgin, give me sanctuary.’</p>
<p class="indented">She was so startled that she relaxed her hold on the door enough for me to push my way in and slam it behind me. I tumbled into a barely furnished room where two small children sat at a scrubbed wooden table, staring at me with their mouths open. I nodded to them, and looked around.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Get in that corner. If they come near my family, I’ll bloody kill you myself,’ she muttered. ‘What do they look like?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know. One of them might be lame.’ I retreated into the shadows behind a rickety cupboard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Lame? How slow do you run, then?’</p>
<p class="indented">One of the children giggled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The other one isn’t. And they’re armed.’</p>
<p class="indented">The amused expression vanished; she glanced towards the door, her mouth set tight.</p>
<p class="indented">Minutes passed; I heard the children jostling for a place at the window, and a cry from the street. Eventually the woman burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Huguenots, you say?’</p>
<p class="indented">I stepped out, cautious. ‘Have they gone? Is there something funny?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘There were two of them, all right, marching up and down looking for someone. One in a cleric’s robes. The other was a dwarf. Were they the ones?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘They were in disguise,’ I said, feeling ridiculous.</p>
<p class="indented">She made no effort to hide her smile, but her eyes were gently teasing. ‘The dwarf disguise was very good.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘God will reward you for your charity, madame.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sure he will,’ she murmured, eyeing the purse at my belt. I drew out a sou and tossed it to the taller of the children, who caught it deftly and beamed at me through the gap in his teeth. ‘God be with you, monsieur,’ she said, at the door, tucking a strand of hair under her cap. ‘You can always take refuge here if you’re menaced by dwarves again. I’m a widow,’ she added, lowering her voice with a glance at the children, in case her meaning was unclear. I gave a brief nod, embarrassed, and turned towards home, one hand on my dagger, keeping to the centre of the street.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">A man in cleric’s robes, the woman had said. An educated, well-born priest, by his voice – a friend of Paul’s, or an enemy? What had they been looking for? Whatever it was, it must be significant; they had immediately jumped to the conclusion that someone else had been looking for it too. ‘Who could possibly know?’ the one dressed as a priest had said; did he mean who would know Paul was dead, or something else? I reached inside my doublet and touched the charred fragment of paper with my fingertips. Was this what they had hoped to find? If so, my resolution not to involve myself further in Paul’s murder was worthless; I was already up to my neck in it.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">I returned to the Swan and Cross, still glancing behind to make sure I was not being followed. The fact that I saw no one in the streets made me all the more uneasy. The tavern was crowded now that night covered its patrons’ entrances and exits. Someone had brought out a rebec and struck up a tune; the shrieking of girls and snatches of raucous song carried the length of the street. Gaston spotted me across the room and shoved his way through to intercept me at the door, blocking my view with his wide shoulders.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Couple of fellers come round just now asking after you,’ he said, lowering his voice. ‘Said they had an urgent message for you. No one told them anything, so far as I know. Thought you should be warned.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A dwarf?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Eh?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Was one of them a dwarf?’</p>
<p class="indented">He laughed, and clapped me on the shoulder. ‘What – family, is he?’</p>
<p class="indented">It was Gaston’s great joke that all Neapolitans are stunted. This apparently never grew any less entertaining, no matter how often he repeated it – despite the fact that he stood only an inch or two above me himself. ‘Taller’n you, anyway, mate.’ He stopped laughing at the look on my face. He leaned in, his breath hot on my ear. ‘These were soldiers, not dwarves. What’ve you done now, Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m not sure I know, exactly.’</p>
<p class="indented">A chill prickled up my spine. Word travelled fast in this city; every faction had eyes and ears everywhere. A dwarf and a priest were one thing; if someone was sending professional soldiers after me, the stakes were already higher than I had imagined, and I had no idea who might have sent them. King Henri had troops of Swiss guards under his command, but the Duke of Guise, leader of the Catholic League, had also mustered private forces of his own. It had become fashionable among the nobility to keep dwarves as servants or jesters, in imitation of the royal court. Both the soldiers and the men in Paul’s rooms could have belonged to anyone.</p>
<p class="indented">I stayed at the Swan until late, drinking little, eyes fixed on the door as I lingered over a bowl of mutton stew that Gaston had insisted on adding to my growing bill, though my stomach was so tight with apprehension that I swallowed less than half of it. When, some time after midnight, he bellowed that he was locking up and the company reluctantly began to stir, I borrowed a lantern and drifted down the street in the wake of a group of students I half knew, all of them too poor to go on to a brothel, who invited me to someone’s rooms for cards, eagerly brandishing a bottle of cheap <em class="calibre6">eau de vie</em> one of them had concealed beneath his cloak. I was briefly tempted, if only for the protection of their numbers, but I knew how these nights ended: the muddy light of dawn seeping through shutters, a dense head, furred mouth and always a lighter purse, regardless of the hands played. These boys were twenty; I no longer had the stomach for it. I declined and slipped away towards my own lodgings, though I am not sure they even noticed my absence as they reeled away in the torchlight, striking up another catch involving a country priest and a wayward shepherdess, arms slung around one another’s shoulders. Someone would throw a chamber pot over them before they reached the end of the street.</p>
<p class="indented">Their song still rang in the air as I stopped at the house where I rented rooms on the top floor. I set down the lantern and struggled to unlock the street door with my left hand, dagger drawn in my right. While I was fumbling, two figures unpeeled and gathered shape and substance out of the shadows to either side. I had been so nerved for them that I was barely caught off guard; I stepped back, holding the blade out before me, levelling it between them. They acknowledged it with amused indulgence, as you might a child waving a stick. Each of them held a broadsword, pointed downwards and resting casually against his leg, though I knew the blade could take my head off with one practised stroke before I could get close enough to graze them.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Are you the Italian they call Bruno?’ The taller of the two spoke with a thick Provençal accent.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is asking?’</p>
<p class="indented">He lifted his sword a fraction. ‘I suggest you put that away, sir,’ he said, nodding to my dagger. ‘Keep things civilised. We don’t want to disturb anybody, do we?’ I followed his eyes upwards to the windows. It was true that I preferred not to wake my landlady, Madame de la Fosse, who already had her views on the desirability of a rumoured heretic as a tenant, and she had the hearing of a bat; the first sign of a scuffle and she would throw back the shutters, screaming for the night watch. Although perhaps that would be to my advantage in the short term.</p>
<p class="indented">Reluctantly, I sheathed the dagger. ‘What do you want with me?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘We just need you to come with us, sir,’ said the second one, in an accent as rough as his colleague’s. Clouds covered the moon and I could see little of their expressions in the flickering glow from the light on the doorstep; both were broad-faced and bearded, with grim mouths and unsmiling eyes. The ‘sir’ was, I presumed, wholly mocking. They wore no livery over their leather surcoats.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Someone wants a word with you,’ said the first, picking up my lantern. ‘Won’t take long.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where are we going?’ I asked, trying to sound calm, as we began walking towards the river, each of them a solid presence hemming me in, so close I could feel the pressure of their shoulders against mine on either side and smell their stale sweat. I knew these streets well enough in the dark, but there was no prospect of running. The one holding the lantern turned his head to offer a sideways grin with missing teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It’s a surprise,’ he said, breaking into a low laugh that was the opposite of reassuring.</p>
