<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter022">TWENTY-TWO</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">I was woken the following day by the slamming of my chamber door as Sidney, dressed in a plum-coloured velvet doublet and short breeches with white silk stockings, threw it open without a knock, grinning broadly as he strode across and drew back the curtains with a flourish to let in the full force of the midday spring sun. At his insistence I had returned directly with him and was now lodged at Christ Church College, in an oak-panelled room adjacent to his own, several degrees of luxury above the chamber I had become used to at Lincoln. Here I had a soft bed, woollen blankets, fresh water for washing and a jug of small beer by my bed, though I had barely had a chance to appreciate any of this comparative ease, since I had done nothing but sleep since we had returned from Hazeley Court the previous day.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And how do I find you this fine afternoon, my adventurous friend?’ Sidney asked, pouring himself a cup of beer. I noticed that he was now quite openly wearing an ornamental sword at his belt, despite the university’s absolute ban on weapons. Clearly he had decided that the circumstances warranted a breach of etiquette.</p>
<p class="indented">I struggled to sit up, feeling my shoulder twinge viciously as I leaned my weight on my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is it afternoon already? This shoulder is still bad but I feel rested, I think.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you should, you have been asleep almost a whole day. You have missed all the excitement.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, what has happened?’ I asked anxiously, wincing again as I tried to push myself up on my bad arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gilbert and Sophia were taken shortly after we found you yesterday, at a house in Abingdon,’ he said, taking an orange from his pocket and digging his thumb into the peel, ‘and Jenkes is fled. His shop was raided last night but nothing incriminating was found, if you can believe it. His apprentice was taken for questioning but says only that his master has had to travel on business. That snake has slipped through our fingers this time, but at least he will not trouble you again in Oxford.’ He tore a curling strip of peel from the orange and let it drop on the stand beside my bed. The scent brought back a sharp memory of that first morning in Roger Mercer’s room, the peel under the desk, the faint smell on the pages of the almanac. Might it have been better altogether if I had left that book alone, if I had never caught the scent of orange juice from its covers?</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sophia and Jerome – where are they?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Father Jerome is on his way to London for some uncomfortable questioning,’ he said, seeming more interested in delicately separating a segment of his orange and holding it out to me. His detachment made me uncomfortable. ‘Sophia,’ Sidney continued, putting a piece of fruit into his mouth, ‘is at present under the supervision of her father. It seems they allowed her to be released on bail.’ He gave me a long look, one eyebrow raised in what I judged to be a disapproving complicity, before licking his fingers deliberately and turning away to the window. ‘Anyway, I came to tell you that there is a messenger arrived at the porter’s lodge just now from Rector Underhill himself, inviting you to visit him at his lodgings before you leave Oxford.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will go straight away,’ I said, levering myself gingerly out of bed, anxious to speak to Sophia if only to make sure she had decided to confirm my story about the letters. The fact that she had been released into the custody of her father suggested that she had not insisted too vehemently on her loyalty to Jerome, but she may simply have pleaded her belly. How she must have hated me, I thought, when she saw him led away in manacles by the pursuivants. More than anything, I wanted the chance to ask her forgiveness, to convince her that I had acted for her own good. There was little chance she would believe me, but I did not want to leave Oxford with these things unsaid.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will go with you,’ Sidney said, as I pulled on my breeches and buttoned my shirt in such haste that I had it all awry and had to begin again. ‘Jenkes may not be at large, but he has friends who may well have been instructed to see that you don’t get back to London and talk. Until we leave tomorrow, you are not to go unaccompanied or unarmed.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stopped, midway through pulling on my boot.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would like to see the rector alone, though.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Don’t worry – I won’t interfere with your fond farewells. I will make idle chatter with the porter while I wait.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett!’ I exclaimed, remembering that if it were not for his brave insubordination on my behalf, Sidney would never have received my message and I would certainly be either murdered or arrested, depending on which of my pursuers had reached me first. I turned to Sidney apologetically. ‘I fear I must ask you to advance me some of that promised reward from your father-in-law. Jenkes stole my purse, and I would like to thank Cobbett – it was he who sent the boy and brought you to my rescue, at some cost to himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, we shall see what the college cellar may offer a man of such stout heart,’ Sidney said with a grin, opening the door for me. ‘I never thought I would say this, Bruno, but I shall not be sorry to leave these spires behind me this time.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘Nor I,’ I replied with feeling, remembering with a terrible pang of melancholy how I had once dreamed of making my name in Oxford.</p>
<p class="flush-left">When we reached Lincoln gatehouse, carrying a bottle of Spanish wine Sidney had bought from the cellarer at Christ Church, there was no sign of Cobbett in the little lodge beneath the archway. In his place was a thin-faced man with straggly brown hair who looked up at us suspiciously, then lowered his eyes as he registered the quality of Sidney’s clothes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where is Cobbett?’ I asked, more brusquely than necessary.</p>
<p class="indented">The man shrugged, evidently disliking my tone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘All I know is he’s suspended from duty. They’re saying he’ll be retired. Who’d’ye want to see?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Rector Underhill. He is expecting me. Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney clapped me on the shoulder with unusual gentleness.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think I shall take a drink in the Mitre Inn on the corner of the High Street. Find me there when you are done – do not think of going any further without me,’ he added, with a warning glance. The new porter glared at me, then motioned me towards the courtyard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ye’ll find him in his lodgings,’ he grunted, eyeing the bottle of wine. I tucked it tightly under my arm and set off across the courtyard, turning in the middle to glance back with a shudder at the window of the tower room and the doorway to what had been Gabriel Norris and Thomas Allen’s room.</p>
<p class="indented">The rector’s old servant, Adam, opened the door to my knock and almost fell backwards when he saw me, his usual surly countenance replaced by a wide-eyed expression of honest terror. He pulled the door close behind him so that his voice would not carry and stepped out into the passageway.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I can pay you, sir,’ he hissed, clutching urgently at the front of my doublet. ‘I have money saved for my old age – it is not a fortune, but you may find a use for it. You know, it was only ill luck that you saw me that night, for I hardly ever go to that place any more, it was only to oblige a friend, but if you must make a report or a list of names, I pray you, take what money I have in my coffers, if only my name might not appear—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Peace, Adam,’ I whispered back, removing his trembling hands from my clothes and feeling oddly insulted. ‘I have no use for your money, nor has anyone asked me for names. But if you will profess a forbidden faith, at least have the courage to be true to it – otherwise what is the point?’</p>
<p class="indented">He offered up a limp smile of gratitude, then opened the door for me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My master is within,’ he murmured, bowing his head.</p>
<p class="indented">In the wide reception room where we had dined so companionably on my first evening in Oxford, the rector stood facing the window that gave on to the Grove, hands clasped behind his back. I glanced around at the empty dining table, remembering where Roger Mercer and James Coverdale had sat at that dinner, recalling the deep rumble of Mercer’s laughter. Perhaps the rector too was remembering as he looked out over the garden where Mercer had met his terrible death only hours later. Adam closed the door behind me with a click and slipped discreetly through the door to the interior room. Underhill still did not stir from the window; when he spoke, he kept his back to me, his voice flat and unnatural.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My daughter would speak to you next door, Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">I waited, but nothing more was forthcoming, so I followed Adam through the door to the rector’s private room, where Sophia and I had once talked of magic in what seemed like another age.</p>
<p class="indented">Now she stood alone by the fireplace, her hands resting on one of the high-backed wooden chairs. Her long dark hair was modestly tied back, though a few curling tendrils had escaped and hung about her face. There was still nothing about her figure, slight in a straight-bodiced dark grey dress, to advertise her condition, save for perhaps a fullness about the bust, but her face seemed thinner, more pinched and drained, and her eyes were puffy with exhaustion and tears.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The pursuivants caught up with us at a house in Abingdon,’ she said, without preamble, and though her face looked so fragile, her voice was as clear and strong as always. ‘They asked Jerome what he was. He answered that he was a gentleman and a Christian. Then they tore off his shirt and saw his hairshirt.’ She hesitated for a moment to swallow hard, then took a deep breath and continued without looking at me, her voice steady again. ‘They arrested him as a traitor, shackled him and took him away. I begged them to take me with him, but I was brought back to Oxford.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘They shackled you?’ I asked, horrified.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No. They were surprisingly gentle. But then I did not resist them. I was taken to the Castle gaol,’ she said, finally raising her head and looking me in the eye, almost defiantly. Then she shook her head and seemed to crumple. ‘You cannot imagine it, Bruno, if you have not seen it. Or smelled it. People would not keep animals in such conditions. One low room they have for the poor women, with filthy straw over the floor that stinks of piss and shit, and the walls are so damp there is fungus growing there and the cold goes right inside your bones. I think I will feel that cold for the rest of my life.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘They put you in such a place? But did you not tell them of …?’ I faltered and indicated my stomach. She gave a small bitter laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I told them, despite the damage to my honour. Jerome said that I should not speak if I were arrested, save to acknowledge my name. Yet I thought they might treat me with more gentleness than otherwise. But it seems it was all designed to frighten me. I was left in that hole for two hours, among the insane and the destitute, crowding around me, pulling at my clothes and hair, women covered in lice and sores and the stink of rotten flesh and human filth all around me –’ Finally her voice cracked and I took a step towards her instinctively, wanting to put my arm around her, but she straightened up immediately and glared at me and I realised with a guilty jolt that there was no comfort I could give: I was the enemy.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then what happened?’ I prompted, trying to cover over my ill-judged show of emotion.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My father arrived,’ she said, shaking her hair back. ‘They had sent for him. It seemed he had been told that I was arrested in the company of a notorious Jesuit, but that I had secretly handed over certain damning documents to the authorities, suggesting that my loyalty lay with the forces of Her Majesty’s law after all. That being the case, and given the delicacy of my condition,’ here she patted her own stomach with a sarcastic smile, ‘he was free to stand surety for my release.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then – you did not contradict them?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I presumed it was you who had told them the story about the letters,’ she said softly, her tone betraying neither gratitude nor anger. ‘You gave me a chance to escape, even at the last minute. And the sheriff did me a kindness, I think, in insisting I be thrown in the prison first. Had I not seen that, I might have been stubborn enough to insist on the truth, for Jerome’s sake. But two hours in that pit –’ She broke off and shuddered, her hand straying absently to her belly in a gesture of protection. ‘I feared that even in that short time I would catch the gaol fever – the air was so dank and full of poisons. And I was afraid for the child,’ she added, so quietly I could barely catch the words. ‘If its father must die, it should at least have the chance to live.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m glad,’ I said, with feeling.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sure you are,’ she replied. ‘It would not have done for your masters to discover that you lied to save a Catholic whore, would it? You played your part very well, Bruno, I never suspected you. But then, you never suspected me, did you? So perhaps you are not so clever as you believe.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not expect you to thank me,’ I whispered. ‘You have every reason to hate me. But I only ever acted out of care for you. He would have had you killed, Sophia, on the crossing to France, I am sure of it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You say that only because Thomas put it in your head. Jerome would never have harmed me. He loves me.’ A sob caught in her throat and she turned her face away to swallow it down, determined that I should not see the weakness of tears.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He loved his mission more,’ I said. ‘Well, it is fortunate that our opposing theories were never put to the test, and you are still alive.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Fortunate? Oh yes, I am fortunate indeed,’ she said, her voice tight with bitterness. ‘I am to be banished by my family, the man I love will die in cruel pain and I will never see him again, the child I carry will be taken from me before I can even give it a name and after that I will be interrogated by the authorities. If it pleases them not to detain me, I will be sent back to live with my aunt, perhaps in time to be married to some rough unlettered farmer or inn-keeper, if one can be found who will overlook my sins. And who is the author of all this good fortune? Why, it is you, Bruno.’ Anger flashed for a moment in her beautiful amber eyes, but she was too defeated to sustain it, and the fierce light quickly died.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps when you hold your child in your arms, even for a moment, you may hate me less,’ I said, looking steadily at her. She brushed a loose strand of hair from her face and met my gaze.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not hate you, Bruno,’ she said wearily. ‘I hate the world. I hate God. I hate religion and the way it makes men believe that they alone are right.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You sound like Thomas Allen,’ I said, and instantly regretted what sounded like an attempt at levity. To my surprise, though, she gave a weak smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And we have seen where that may lead. Poor, poor Thomas. No, life is too short for hating.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your faith will not survive interrogation, then?’</p>
<p class="indented">She almost laughed then, her face briefly lighting up.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My <em class="calibre2">faith</em>, as you call it, was only ever a way to please him. I would have worshipped the Moon and the Sun and sacrificed a cockerel to the Devil at midnight if that would have made him love me better.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I well remember – you asked my advice on it once,’ I said. ‘But I would advise you not to say as much when you are interviewed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, Bruno.’ She shook her head. ‘Have no fear for me on that account. When I saw that gaol today, I knew without doubt that I could never endure years in such a place for love of the pope. For Jerome, yes, but he would not be here to appreciate it, would he? And the child must survive. That is all that matters now.’ She fell silent then and stared down at her folded hands for a long while. I didn’t dare to move. Eventually she reached into a pocket sewn into her dress and drew out a folded scrap of paper. Stepping across the room towards me, she took my bandaged right hand and pressed the paper into it, holding my hand between hers for a few moments while she looked intently into my eyes. Despite everything, my heart gave a foolish jolt and I was seized by a desire to take her in my arms. The cruelty of the fate that she described reminded me painfully once again of Morgana; I had sentenced a young woman of spirit and beauty to be crushed beneath the wheels of propriety and the injustice of it clutched at my heart. I still clung to the belief that I had saved her life, but I would always live with a tiny kernel of doubt: what if Jerome Gilbert really had meant to escort her to safety in France? I would never be wholly sure and neither would she; that uncertainty bound us together, and I felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility for her. If there was anything I could do to help her now, I determined that I would not let her down again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Write to me,’ she whispered, glancing nervously towards the door in case her father should overhear. ‘Tell me how he died, what he said on the scaffold. That is all I wish. This is the address of my aunt in Kent. I will be taken there tomorrow and I do not think I will ever return to Oxford.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Surely your father would not banish you for good?’</p>
<p class="indented">She shook her head, her lips pressed tight.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You do not know my father. If you could do this one thing …’ She let the sentence trail away and squeezed my hand gently; I tried not to wince.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Bruno.’ Her wide eyes roved over mine as if searching for something. ‘If you had only come to Oxford two years ago – how different everything might have been. Perhaps we … But it is no good dwelling on what might have been. It is too late now for me.’ She leaned forward and kissed me softly on the cheek, so gently that I might have imagined the brush of her lips over my skin. She squeezed my hand once more and let go.</p>
<p class="indented">As I turned towards the door, my heart so heavy I felt stooped by the weight of it, she whispered, ‘Write!’ I looked back to see her miming writing on the palm of her hand, her face stretched into a brave attempt at a smile. I nodded and turned my back on her for the last time.</p>
<p class="indented">When I closed the door behind me, the rector was still standing in the same position, silhouetted against the window, but he had turned to face the room and kept his arms folded across his chest, his small beady eyes fixed on me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So, Doctor Bruno, I have you to thank for delivering the college from a brutal murderer and a seditious Jesuit.’ His tone was oddly unemotional, as though all capacity for feeling had drained out of him; I could not tell if he were pleased by this or not, and the ambiguity of his words made me pause.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You know, Rector, that the two were not the same person?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know that Gabriel Norris – I cannot think of him any other way – is to be charged with the murders of Roger Mercer, James Coverdale, Ned Lacy and Thomas Allen, and with treasonable intent towards Her Majesty’s person. I have learned, too, that there are other accusations made against him, perhaps of less interest to the Privy Council but none the less of considerable significance to my own family.’</p>
<p class="indented">Here he drew in a great shuddering breath that seemed as if it would wrack his very soul; briefly his eyes met mine and I saw in them a weight of sorrow that I understood would burden him the remainder of his natural life. I also understood, in that moment, that Sophia had spoken the truth; there was a degree of coldness in the rector that would allow him to cut her off for good if he felt it necessary. In his eyes I saw the grief of a man who has already lost both his children. I wanted to intercede with him, to plead on her behalf, but decided to hold my tongue; my interference in the business of this college and especially this family was perhaps sufficient.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not think we will see you in Oxford again, Doctor Bruno,’ he said stiffly, holding out a hand for me to shake as he walked across to the main door, the boards creaking under his feet in the silence. ‘In the light of recent events, I regret not confiding in you sooner, but here in Oxford we are not accustomed to regarding foreigners as – well, you see my position.’ He held the hand out more insistently and I reached out to take it, whereupon he grasped my hand between both of his and fixed me with an imploring stare. Sophia had been fortunate, I thought as we looked at one another, that she had taken all her looks from her mother. Or perhaps not so fortunate; had she been less beautiful, her situation now might be very different.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Among my many regrets, Doctor Bruno,’ he continued, seeming to shrink slightly as he held tight to my hand, ‘I could wish I had been a more gracious host and friend to you. Had I known of your connections – but I have much to reprimand myself for, as you may imagine. But perhaps if you have the opportunity to convey to the Earl of Leicester that I have only ever tried to serve him and the university to the best of my ability, that would not be too much to ask? I expect to hear from him concerning these events, and I am not at all sure of how he will receive the news.’ His eyes grew wide with fear as he wrung my arm urgently, unaware that he was even doing so.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would help you if I could, but I’m afraid you mistake my intimacy with the earl – I have never met him in my life.’ Seeing his disappointment, I quickly added, ‘but I’m sure that if I discuss these matters with Sir Philip, he will not be ignorant of your loyalty.’</p>
<p class="indented">The rector nodded solemnly and released my hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you. It is more than I deserve. You were a most worthy adversary in the debating hall, Doctor Bruno. I only wish we might have had the opportunity again.’</p>
<p class="indented">You have a short memory, I thought, as I smiled politely; I was your superior in substance and conduct, though it pleased you to ridicule me before the entire congregation of the university. But that humiliation seemed a trivial thing now.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is one favour I must ask of you in return,’ I said, as we approached the door. He looked at me with mild surprise. ‘I have learned that Cobbett has been suspended from his duties.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is correct,’ the rector said. ‘Master Slythurst made a most serious complaint that he deliberately disregarded orders to hand over sensitive documents and allowed a thief to escape college who might otherwise have been detained.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stared at him, incredulous.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But surely you know, Rector, that the thief he describes was me? And if Cobbett had not disobeyed Slythurst to get an urgent message to Sir Philip, I would be dead by now, and so would your daughter!’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nevertheless,’ said the rector, in the same flat voice, affecting to become absorbed in a loose thread on his gown, ‘Master Slythurst is a senior Fellow of this college, and as a college servant, Cobbett’s duty was to obey his orders, not those of a visitor who had been found removing items from a student’s room. For that dereliction of duty he has been punished.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Those papers, in Sir Philip’s hands, saved your daughter’s life,’ I said, lowering my voice. ‘In Slythurst’s hands, they might not have done so in time. Cobbett acted according to his conscience and for this he should be rewarded.’</p>
<p class="indented">Underhill stopped picking at his gown and fixed me with a direct stare.</p>
<p class="indented">‘In your opinion,’ he replied, enunciating each word carefully and precisely.</p>
<p class="indented">I could not believe what I was hearing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘His actions saved Sophia from being murdered,’ I repeated, more slowly in case he had not understood the first time. ‘And your grandchild,’ I added deliberately, since this did not seem to provoke a response. ‘You do not think that is worth rewarding?’</p>
<p class="indented">For a moment he did not answer but continued to look at me with something like pity.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It has never occurred to you that I might rather have rewarded the man who could have spared my family all this?’</p>
<p class="indented">It took the space of a heartbeat for me to comprehend what he was saying; when I did, I could hardly credit it.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You would have wished me not to interfere?’ I shook my head in disbelief. ‘You do understand that he meant to kill her? Jerome Gilbert – Gabriel Norris, whatever you want to call him? His intention was to have her drowned on the way to France to spare himself the ignominy of discovery. In time, you and your wife would have received a letter saying she had run away to join a religious order and you would have been none the wiser.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you do not think her mother would have found that easier to bear?’ He took a step towards me, and I saw that all his poise was on the verge of shattering; his hands trembled violently and he clasped them together until his knuckles turned white. ‘We could at least have gone into our old age benignly deceived. Instead, my daughter is arrested in the company of a Jesuit missionary and escorted back to Oxford by the Sheriff’s men. I have to go to the Castle gaol in person to pay for her release, where I find her in the company of thieves and whores. Then I must escort her back to college in full view of all the town, I must endure their jeers and whispers as we pass, as my wife will endure them should she ever venture out of her room again, which is doubtful. I would be a fool to believe the rumours are not already in full flood. I will be known hereafter as the father of a Jesuit’s whore, grandsire to a papist bastard. My reputation in the university is finished, and her mother’s nerves will not bear this new assault, I fear.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked at him with contempt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Better she had been quietly murdered, and your reputation survived unblemished?’ I said, through my teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No doubt you think me a monster for saying so,’ he replied, with no trace of apology. ‘But you have no children, so you cannot know the pain of losing them. My daughter is dead to me in any case, Bruno. Better she had been lost at sea and her mother spared this shame. Yes, I think so. Better for Sophia, too. She will have no kind of a life after this.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you would rather have gone on harbouring a Jesuit in the college and living well from his fees, if it meant an easy life? Or perhaps you knew about Norris all along?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No – that is a lie!’ he cried, springing forward. ‘I had no idea about Norris. Perhaps that in itself is a grave failing, but I would never knowingly have tolerated an active missionary in the college, it is absurd to suggest so. I pray you, do not repeat that suggestion to your friend Sir Philip. Norris paid his way and he was granted no more or less licence than the other commoners.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Norris was recommended for a place here by Edmund Allen,’ I said, ‘a man you already knew to be a secret Catholic. And Norris never attended chapel – did that not strike you as suspicious?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The sons of gentlemen are not used to rising early. It is one of their privileges that they are not expected to.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Every dispensation may be bought here,’ I said, looking at him with scorn. ‘It reminds me so much of Rome. But you knew about the others, too, didn’t you?’</p>
<p class="indented">He sighed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I knew about William Bernard. But everyone in Oxford did – it was no secret that he kept to the old ways, though he took the Oath. But he was a recalcitrant old man and judged harmless. He is fled, by the way, but I don’t think there will be too much of a hunt put out for him. To put a white-haired old fellow like that in gaol or stand him on a scaffold does not play well with the people, as the Privy Council knows. And the others – I suppose when I am questioned about Norris I must reveal their names?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not think that will be necessary,’ I said, reeling from his callous words about Sophia. ‘The names of the worst offenders are already known.’</p>
<p class="indented">He studied me as he reached for the door handle.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have too much compassion, Doctor Bruno, to be embroiled in this business. I know that you lied to spare my daughter a public trial. Just as I could have handed the Catholics here, the whole lot of them, over to the pursuivants years ago, but I thought we could all rub along together. I see now one has to be ruthless, and for men like us, it is not in our character. You are like me in that regard,’ he added, with a hint of self-satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, sir,’ I said quietly, as he held the door open for me to pass. ‘I am nothing like you. Had I a daughter, I hope I would not wish for her death rather than my own dishonour.’ He opened his mouth as if to protest, but I cut him off. ‘She is no whore. She is a woman of mettle, and she deserves your care and protection, not your contempt.’</p>
<p class="indented">I left him standing in the doorway, his mouth still gaping wordlessly like a fish, and strode purposefully across the quadrangle of Lincoln College for the last time. At the gatehouse I turned to take my final look, and saw the outline of Sophia at the first-floor window of the rector’s lodgings, her figure distorted by the patterned glass, one hand raised in farewell.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter020" class="calibre4">TWENTY</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Jacopo’s steward appeared and between us we carried the Count upstairs to one of the guest rooms. He looked so broken when we laid him on the bed that even the physician turned pale; it would not have surprised me to learn that the journey had killed him. But the physician confirmed he was still breathing, and called briskly for hot water and clean linen to be brought before urging me and Jacopo from the room and promising to fetch us when he had examined the patient.</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo asked the steward to bring us a jug of hot wine in his study. He gestured me to a chair near the hearth, while he hurried across to his desk and tidied away the book and papers lying there. Then he pulled up a chair opposite, threw another log on to the fire and poked it until the sparks jumped up like a furnace. When it was blazing higher, he leaned forward, elbows on his knees, chin propped on his fists, and stared into the flames, his expression unreadable.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you,’ I said, when I could no longer stand the silence. ‘I put you in a difficult position, I know.’</p>
<p class="indented">He did not shift his posture, merely turned his head to look at me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I can barely frame my thoughts into words, Bruno. How could he have been down there for thirteen years without anyone knowing? Even the poorest wretch in the kingdom would not let his dog live like that.’ He shook his head, gazing at the fire again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I suppose no one inspects the prisons,’ I said. ‘It was Guise’s doing – all of it. He blinded the Count on Saint Bartholomew’s night and threw him in that dungeon. He’s been paying them to keep him there ever since.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But why? What use is the Count to him in that state?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know. But it has something to do with Circe. Léonie de Châtillon. She was married to him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So she was.’ Jacopo stared at me, his face creased with concern. ‘Why do you say that?’</p>
<p class="indented">I related the conversation I had heard from the Duchess of Montpensier’s balcony.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Guise distinctly said that now the girl was dead, she would not cause them any trouble. His sister then said the Count should die too. Guise was going to kill him in the morning.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So they had no further use for him without Léonie. But why, I wonder?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am hoping the Count will be able to tell us.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wouldn’t depend upon it, Bruno.’ He leaned forward and poked the fire again. ‘Moving him like that almost finished him off, the physician said. He may not last the night. Even if he rallies, do you not think his mind will be as broken as his body, after thirteen years in that pit?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think his wits are sharper than you might imagine,’ I said. ‘We can only hope.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What in God’s name were you doing on the Duchess’s balcony, anyway?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was in her room looking for a letter.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What letter?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Any one. I needed to see her handwriting.’</p>
<p class="indented">I explained about the letters to Joseph de Chartres from his mystery lover. Jacopo listened, his frown growing more entrenched.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But now you think the Duchess is not the mistress after all?’ he asked, when I had finished.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not as far as I can see. But Guise is behind all this somehow, Jacopo, I know it – all three deaths. I just cannot find one piece of evidence that will tie him to it conclusively. Still, perhaps we can take comfort in having saved one life tonight. Or at least making his death more dignified.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Poor, poor man. I cannot bear to think of what he has suffered. He was accounted very handsome once, you know. And a fine soldier.’ He clenched and unclenched his fists. ‘I sometimes think the Duke of Guise is the Devil incarnate.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was Guise I saw in the Greek mask on his way to the clearing, around the time Léonie was killed. I got into a scuffle with him – he took my knife from me. Two days later, he gave it to the Duke of Montpensier.’ I took a sip of wine and wrapped my hands around the glass to warm them. ‘I am certain Guise must have been the one Léonie was expecting to meet, when she blurted out to me that she could not go through with it. He planned to use her to attack the King. It is the only explanation that fits.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo let out a sigh. ‘It is one explanation, certainly. But as you say, you have no proof beyond one overheard conversation that can easily be denied, and another with a girl who is now dead, and can tell us nothing at all.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Count may know something.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He may, but who would take his testimony seriously, in his state?’ He scratched the tuft of hair in the centre of his balding pate. ‘All this is speculation.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But I have a feeling we are drawing closer to the truth than we have been all along,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Still, only this mysterious lover can prove or disprove Guise’s involvement.’ He refilled my glass and his own and sat back, his hands folded in his lap, contemplating the flames. ‘You say she persuaded Joseph de Chartres to kill Lefèvre for fear he – de Chartres – would be denounced as a spy? No mention of this conspiracy involving Circe that you thought was the reason for the priest’s death?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No. That was odd, I grant you. Perhaps she feared to put that in writing.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Hm. A spy for whom, though? I thought de Chartres was a loyal League man.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Christ, I don’t know.’ I put my head in my hands. ‘In this city it could be anybody. The young curate at Saint-Séverin mentioned that he’d heard Lefèvre calling Joseph <em class="calibre6">Judas</em>. Perhaps it was true that he had discovered a betrayal.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And I suppose you still won’t heed my advice to leave this business altogether?’ he asked gently.</p>
<p class="indented">‘How can I? When I am so close. If I can give the King this, Jacopo – proof that will publicly condemn Guise and his associates for murder – he will be in my debt.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You think he will give you back your position at court?’ I heard the scepticism in his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would not expect that. I only want modest financial support and immunity from persecution for my books. A post at the University, perhaps.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo ran a hand across his head and did not look at me. ‘For himself, Henri might do that much, but I don’t know if Catherine would permit it. In any case, you will not get much sense out of the King at the moment. Léonie’s death seems to have affected him badly. He has fallen into one of his fits of melancholy and will see no one.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then the surest way to lift him from it is to bring her killer to justice.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What do you propose? Break into the house of every woman who associates with the Catholic League and steal a sample of her handwriting?’</p>
<p class="indented">I shifted in my chair. The pain in my hip from my impetuous leap earlier was growing worse. ‘If that is what it takes.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">He sighed. ‘Ah, Bruno. Your stubbornness will be your undoing, one way or another.’</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">An hour ticked by. Jacopo returned to his desk to continue with his paperwork. I picked up a book and tried to read, but I could barely keep my eyes open. Overhead the boards creaked in different tones as the physician moved about the room. My clothes smelled of the gaol again, and from carrying the Count; I caught the stink rising from them in the heat of the fire. Eventually there came a discreet tap at the door and the physician entered, wiping his hands on a linen cloth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He is more comfortable now. I’ve given him a draught to help him sleep.’ He shook his head, amazed. ‘He must have the constitution of a lion, to have survived in that condition for so long. Man’s capacity for endurance is remarkable.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will he live?’ I asked, standing.</p>
<p class="indented">He gave me a frank look. ‘For a while. But do not expect too much. His health is in shreds. He will not get well again, in the sense that you might understand it. His body has been destroyed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But, for now …?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I see no immediate danger. There is no trace of gaol fever that I can detect.’ He turned to Jacopo. ‘I will return in the morning. If he wakes, I recommend a thin chicken stock – nothing more substantial. His stomach will not cope with it. And – ah – if we might discuss the matter of the fee …?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will sit with him, in case he wakes,’ I offered, partly because I did not want to hear how much the Count’s life was going to cost Jacopo. That was something else we would have to work out when – if – I eventually had any reward from Henri.</p>
<p class="indented">The bedchamber was warm and airless, hazy with woodsmoke from the fire that had been stoked high and now blazed fiercely. A faint vegetal trace of medicinal herbs lingered, but it was not enough to disguise the smell of decaying flesh. The Count lay stretched out under blankets, perfectly still, dwarfed and shrunken against the plump pillows. The doctor had bathed him and dressed his wounds, clothed him in a clean nightshirt and taken the worst of the filth from his face, but if anything this only made his wasted flesh seem more naked, the scarred tissue around his empty sockets more ghastly. He looked entirely bloodless, like a mummified corpse, as if you could snap off one of the desiccated limbs and nothing would spill out but dead insects and dust. But he was alive, I reminded myself, and free.</p>
<p class="indented">I fell asleep in the chair by his bed. I do not know how many minutes or hours passed, but I was awakened by a choking noise; I lunged forward and lifted him, holding his torso upright while his breath rattled in his chest like a handful of stones thrown down a dry well. When the coughing fit subsided, he slumped back into my arms. I thought he was asleep; I was about to lay him down once more when he drew a scraping breath.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I dreamed I felt the wind on my face.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You did,’ I said, amazed and delighted to hear him speak, though he was barely audible. ‘I’m sorry I could not arrange the sun, but it’s the middle of the night in December. Soon it will be spring, though,’ I continued, trying to sound encouraging. ‘When you are well again, you will be able to sit outside in the sun and hear the birdsong.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not think I will see the spring, boy.’ His hand clawed for mine. ‘I dreamed they gave me something to take away the pain. And that I was lying in a feather bed. I think I am still dreaming it.’ His voice was faint and full of wonder.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, it is real.’ I held his hand. ‘You are safe now.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Such kindness,’ he murmured. ‘I never thought to hear a kind word again.’</p>
<p class="indented">Tears pricked at my eyes; I could not let go of his hand to brush them away.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why did you save me?’ he asked, running his tongue around his cracked lips.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have been the victim of a terrible injustice,’ I said, fighting to keep my voice steady. ‘And—’ I hesitated – ‘he was going to kill you. The Duke of Guise.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah.’ He nodded. ‘Le Balafré. He killed them all, you know.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What?’ I tried not to jolt him as I tensed. I did not see how this could be true – Joseph had killed Lefèvre, for a start – but I wondered what more the Count knew. ‘How do you know?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was there,’ he croaked, trying to sit up. ‘I saw it all, before he put my eyes out. Dragged them from the house, slaughtered them like beasts on the steps. My cousin, his wife, the little girls in their new gowns …’ He tailed off into another bout of coughing. ‘It was <em class="calibre6">her</em> doing,’ he said, with sudden vehemence. I recalled he had said those words before, the night I was imprisoned with him. I closed my eyes and forced myself to be patient. He was not talking about the murders after all; he was tumbling back into the past, to the night of the massacre.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did Guise kill anyone else?’ I asked, as gently as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thousands, I heard. All the Huguenots … they came for the wedding of the Princess Margot to the King of Navarre. My cousin …’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I mean – more recently? Did Guise ever visit you in prison?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh yes, he came. He could not resist. What has happened to my wife?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your wife?’ I was caught out by the question. ‘Why do you ask?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If Guise no longer needed me alive, he must have married her or killed her. One or the other. He only kept my life to bargain with.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t understand,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Water,’ he rasped, his hand fluttering.</p>
<p class="indented">I passed him a cup and tipped it carefully to his parched lips. Most of it was spluttered over the bedclothes, but at length he lay back against the pillow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was my pride,’ he said sadly, raising his head a fraction, just when I thought he had fallen asleep again. ‘I thought I could have whatever I wanted. I chose her. I was forty-five, she was a child of fifteen. I was a powerful man. And the Medici woman needed my alliance. I demanded Léonie. Catherine granted her. It never occurred to either of us that she might have desires of her own.’</p>
<p class="indented">He fell back, as if the length of this speech had exhausted him. I did not want to press him too hard, but I felt he was on the verge of revealing something.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She did not wish to marry you?’ I prompted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She had no choice. But she was in love already and would never love me, she made that clear. I punished her for it.’ A spasm jerked his face; I could not tell if it was pain or remorse.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She loved Guise?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So she said. It was she who brought him to my house with his soldiers that night. She wanted me dead. She thought then he would be rid of his wife and marry her.’ He gave a sigh that shook his frame with alarming force. ‘Well, she learned that night not to trust Le Balafré. He did not give her what she wanted. She was not free, and she knew it. My life kept her bound to him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So—’ I hesitated, trying to work it out – ‘by keeping you alive, he made sure she could not marry again?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was the card in his sleeve,’ he whispered. ‘If she wished to marry, he threatened to bring me out to destroy the match. All this time, she was in thrall to him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did he ever hint that he had pressured her into anything? A plot to kill the King, for instance?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The King?’ A vein trembled at his temple; his face twisted with the effort of remembering. ‘Charles?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Henri. His brother. Henri of Valois is king now.’ This was hopeless. Jacopo was right, I thought; the Count’s memories were so scattered that, though I believed there was truth in them, it would be impossible to sift through in search of anything solid.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Henri …’ His voice drifted away. ‘He never mentioned Henri. But he did say—’ He tried to raise his head again to cough; I slipped my arm beneath his shoulders and lifted him, trying to curb my impatience. ‘More water.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What did Guise say?’ I asked, when the water had been dealt with.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He said she was going to put a Guise bastard on the throne. He laughed like a madman about it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Circe was? I mean, Léonie?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s what he said. I did not understand his meaning.’</p>
<p class="indented">No, but I was beginning to see a glimmer of light.</p>
<p class="indented">‘When did he say this? Was it recently?’</p>
<p class="indented">The Count made a papery noise that might have been laughter. ‘I could not tell you, son. Time had no shape in that darkness. It might have been yesterday, might have been years ago.’</p>
<p class="indented">I patted his hand and settled him back among the pillows. There was no use pushing him any harder tonight; I did not want to risk his fragile state any further. He lay very still again, his chest barely rising and falling, though with no eyes it was impossible to tell if he was asleep. I tucked the blanket closer around him and crept towards the door, when I thought I heard him murmur. I rushed back, laid my hand over his and bent my head close to his lips.</p>
<p class="indented">‘God bless you,’ he croaked. His fingers moved under mine, and he fell silent once more.</p>
