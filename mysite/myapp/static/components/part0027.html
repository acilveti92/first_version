<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter022">TWENTY-TWO</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">I was woken the following day by the slamming of my chamber door as Sidney, dressed in a plum-coloured velvet doublet and short breeches with white silk stockings, threw it open without a knock, grinning broadly as he strode across and drew back the curtains with a flourish to let in the full force of the midday spring sun. At his insistence I had returned directly with him and was now lodged at Christ Church College, in an oak-panelled room adjacent to his own, several degrees of luxury above the chamber I had become used to at Lincoln. Here I had a soft bed, woollen blankets, fresh water for washing and a jug of small beer by my bed, though I had barely had a chance to appreciate any of this comparative ease, since I had done nothing but sleep since we had returned from Hazeley Court the previous day.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And how do I find you this fine afternoon, my adventurous friend?’ Sidney asked, pouring himself a cup of beer. I noticed that he was now quite openly wearing an ornamental sword at his belt, despite the university’s absolute ban on weapons. Clearly he had decided that the circumstances warranted a breach of etiquette.</p>
<p class="indented">I struggled to sit up, feeling my shoulder twinge viciously as I leaned my weight on my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is it afternoon already? This shoulder is still bad but I feel rested, I think.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you should, you have been asleep almost a whole day. You have missed all the excitement.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, what has happened?’ I asked anxiously, wincing again as I tried to push myself up on my bad arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gilbert and Sophia were taken shortly after we found you yesterday, at a house in Abingdon,’ he said, taking an orange from his pocket and digging his thumb into the peel, ‘and Jenkes is fled. His shop was raided last night but nothing incriminating was found, if you can believe it. His apprentice was taken for questioning but says only that his master has had to travel on business. That snake has slipped through our fingers this time, but at least he will not trouble you again in Oxford.’ He tore a curling strip of peel from the orange and let it drop on the stand beside my bed. The scent brought back a sharp memory of that first morning in Roger Mercer’s room, the peel under the desk, the faint smell on the pages of the almanac. Might it have been better altogether if I had left that book alone, if I had never caught the scent of orange juice from its covers?</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sophia and Jerome – where are they?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Father Jerome is on his way to London for some uncomfortable questioning,’ he said, seeming more interested in delicately separating a segment of his orange and holding it out to me. His detachment made me uncomfortable. ‘Sophia,’ Sidney continued, putting a piece of fruit into his mouth, ‘is at present under the supervision of her father. It seems they allowed her to be released on bail.’ He gave me a long look, one eyebrow raised in what I judged to be a disapproving complicity, before licking his fingers deliberately and turning away to the window. ‘Anyway, I came to tell you that there is a messenger arrived at the porter’s lodge just now from Rector Underhill himself, inviting you to visit him at his lodgings before you leave Oxford.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will go straight away,’ I said, levering myself gingerly out of bed, anxious to speak to Sophia if only to make sure she had decided to confirm my story about the letters. The fact that she had been released into the custody of her father suggested that she had not insisted too vehemently on her loyalty to Jerome, but she may simply have pleaded her belly. How she must have hated me, I thought, when she saw him led away in manacles by the pursuivants. More than anything, I wanted the chance to ask her forgiveness, to convince her that I had acted for her own good. There was little chance she would believe me, but I did not want to leave Oxford with these things unsaid.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will go with you,’ Sidney said, as I pulled on my breeches and buttoned my shirt in such haste that I had it all awry and had to begin again. ‘Jenkes may not be at large, but he has friends who may well have been instructed to see that you don’t get back to London and talk. Until we leave tomorrow, you are not to go unaccompanied or unarmed.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stopped, midway through pulling on my boot.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would like to see the rector alone, though.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Don’t worry – I won’t interfere with your fond farewells. I will make idle chatter with the porter while I wait.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett!’ I exclaimed, remembering that if it were not for his brave insubordination on my behalf, Sidney would never have received my message and I would certainly be either murdered or arrested, depending on which of my pursuers had reached me first. I turned to Sidney apologetically. ‘I fear I must ask you to advance me some of that promised reward from your father-in-law. Jenkes stole my purse, and I would like to thank Cobbett – it was he who sent the boy and brought you to my rescue, at some cost to himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, we shall see what the college cellar may offer a man of such stout heart,’ Sidney said with a grin, opening the door for me. ‘I never thought I would say this, Bruno, but I shall not be sorry to leave these spires behind me this time.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘Nor I,’ I replied with feeling, remembering with a terrible pang of melancholy how I had once dreamed of making my name in Oxford.</p>
<p class="flush-left">When we reached Lincoln gatehouse, carrying a bottle of Spanish wine Sidney had bought from the cellarer at Christ Church, there was no sign of Cobbett in the little lodge beneath the archway. In his place was a thin-faced man with straggly brown hair who looked up at us suspiciously, then lowered his eyes as he registered the quality of Sidney’s clothes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where is Cobbett?’ I asked, more brusquely than necessary.</p>
<p class="indented">The man shrugged, evidently disliking my tone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘All I know is he’s suspended from duty. They’re saying he’ll be retired. Who’d’ye want to see?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Rector Underhill. He is expecting me. Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney clapped me on the shoulder with unusual gentleness.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think I shall take a drink in the Mitre Inn on the corner of the High Street. Find me there when you are done – do not think of going any further without me,’ he added, with a warning glance. The new porter glared at me, then motioned me towards the courtyard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ye’ll find him in his lodgings,’ he grunted, eyeing the bottle of wine. I tucked it tightly under my arm and set off across the courtyard, turning in the middle to glance back with a shudder at the window of the tower room and the doorway to what had been Gabriel Norris and Thomas Allen’s room.</p>
<p class="indented">The rector’s old servant, Adam, opened the door to my knock and almost fell backwards when he saw me, his usual surly countenance replaced by a wide-eyed expression of honest terror. He pulled the door close behind him so that his voice would not carry and stepped out into the passageway.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I can pay you, sir,’ he hissed, clutching urgently at the front of my doublet. ‘I have money saved for my old age – it is not a fortune, but you may find a use for it. You know, it was only ill luck that you saw me that night, for I hardly ever go to that place any more, it was only to oblige a friend, but if you must make a report or a list of names, I pray you, take what money I have in my coffers, if only my name might not appear—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Peace, Adam,’ I whispered back, removing his trembling hands from my clothes and feeling oddly insulted. ‘I have no use for your money, nor has anyone asked me for names. But if you will profess a forbidden faith, at least have the courage to be true to it – otherwise what is the point?’</p>
<p class="indented">He offered up a limp smile of gratitude, then opened the door for me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My master is within,’ he murmured, bowing his head.</p>
<p class="indented">In the wide reception room where we had dined so companionably on my first evening in Oxford, the rector stood facing the window that gave on to the Grove, hands clasped behind his back. I glanced around at the empty dining table, remembering where Roger Mercer and James Coverdale had sat at that dinner, recalling the deep rumble of Mercer’s laughter. Perhaps the rector too was remembering as he looked out over the garden where Mercer had met his terrible death only hours later. Adam closed the door behind me with a click and slipped discreetly through the door to the interior room. Underhill still did not stir from the window; when he spoke, he kept his back to me, his voice flat and unnatural.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My daughter would speak to you next door, Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">I waited, but nothing more was forthcoming, so I followed Adam through the door to the rector’s private room, where Sophia and I had once talked of magic in what seemed like another age.</p>
<p class="indented">Now she stood alone by the fireplace, her hands resting on one of the high-backed wooden chairs. Her long dark hair was modestly tied back, though a few curling tendrils had escaped and hung about her face. There was still nothing about her figure, slight in a straight-bodiced dark grey dress, to advertise her condition, save for perhaps a fullness about the bust, but her face seemed thinner, more pinched and drained, and her eyes were puffy with exhaustion and tears.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The pursuivants caught up with us at a house in Abingdon,’ she said, without preamble, and though her face looked so fragile, her voice was as clear and strong as always. ‘They asked Jerome what he was. He answered that he was a gentleman and a Christian. Then they tore off his shirt and saw his hairshirt.’ She hesitated for a moment to swallow hard, then took a deep breath and continued without looking at me, her voice steady again. ‘They arrested him as a traitor, shackled him and took him away. I begged them to take me with him, but I was brought back to Oxford.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘They shackled you?’ I asked, horrified.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No. They were surprisingly gentle. But then I did not resist them. I was taken to the Castle gaol,’ she said, finally raising her head and looking me in the eye, almost defiantly. Then she shook her head and seemed to crumple. ‘You cannot imagine it, Bruno, if you have not seen it. Or smelled it. People would not keep animals in such conditions. One low room they have for the poor women, with filthy straw over the floor that stinks of piss and shit, and the walls are so damp there is fungus growing there and the cold goes right inside your bones. I think I will feel that cold for the rest of my life.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘They put you in such a place? But did you not tell them of …?’ I faltered and indicated my stomach. She gave a small bitter laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I told them, despite the damage to my honour. Jerome said that I should not speak if I were arrested, save to acknowledge my name. Yet I thought they might treat me with more gentleness than otherwise. But it seems it was all designed to frighten me. I was left in that hole for two hours, among the insane and the destitute, crowding around me, pulling at my clothes and hair, women covered in lice and sores and the stink of rotten flesh and human filth all around me –’ Finally her voice cracked and I took a step towards her instinctively, wanting to put my arm around her, but she straightened up immediately and glared at me and I realised with a guilty jolt that there was no comfort I could give: I was the enemy.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then what happened?’ I prompted, trying to cover over my ill-judged show of emotion.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My father arrived,’ she said, shaking her hair back. ‘They had sent for him. It seemed he had been told that I was arrested in the company of a notorious Jesuit, but that I had secretly handed over certain damning documents to the authorities, suggesting that my loyalty lay with the forces of Her Majesty’s law after all. That being the case, and given the delicacy of my condition,’ here she patted her own stomach with a sarcastic smile, ‘he was free to stand surety for my release.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then – you did not contradict them?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I presumed it was you who had told them the story about the letters,’ she said softly, her tone betraying neither gratitude nor anger. ‘You gave me a chance to escape, even at the last minute. And the sheriff did me a kindness, I think, in insisting I be thrown in the prison first. Had I not seen that, I might have been stubborn enough to insist on the truth, for Jerome’s sake. But two hours in that pit –’ She broke off and shuddered, her hand straying absently to her belly in a gesture of protection. ‘I feared that even in that short time I would catch the gaol fever – the air was so dank and full of poisons. And I was afraid for the child,’ she added, so quietly I could barely catch the words. ‘If its father must die, it should at least have the chance to live.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m glad,’ I said, with feeling.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sure you are,’ she replied. ‘It would not have done for your masters to discover that you lied to save a Catholic whore, would it? You played your part very well, Bruno, I never suspected you. But then, you never suspected me, did you? So perhaps you are not so clever as you believe.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not expect you to thank me,’ I whispered. ‘You have every reason to hate me. But I only ever acted out of care for you. He would have had you killed, Sophia, on the crossing to France, I am sure of it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You say that only because Thomas put it in your head. Jerome would never have harmed me. He loves me.’ A sob caught in her throat and she turned her face away to swallow it down, determined that I should not see the weakness of tears.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He loved his mission more,’ I said. ‘Well, it is fortunate that our opposing theories were never put to the test, and you are still alive.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Fortunate? Oh yes, I am fortunate indeed,’ she said, her voice tight with bitterness. ‘I am to be banished by my family, the man I love will die in cruel pain and I will never see him again, the child I carry will be taken from me before I can even give it a name and after that I will be interrogated by the authorities. If it pleases them not to detain me, I will be sent back to live with my aunt, perhaps in time to be married to some rough unlettered farmer or inn-keeper, if one can be found who will overlook my sins. And who is the author of all this good fortune? Why, it is you, Bruno.’ Anger flashed for a moment in her beautiful amber eyes, but she was too defeated to sustain it, and the fierce light quickly died.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps when you hold your child in your arms, even for a moment, you may hate me less,’ I said, looking steadily at her. She brushed a loose strand of hair from her face and met my gaze.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not hate you, Bruno,’ she said wearily. ‘I hate the world. I hate God. I hate religion and the way it makes men believe that they alone are right.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You sound like Thomas Allen,’ I said, and instantly regretted what sounded like an attempt at levity. To my surprise, though, she gave a weak smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And we have seen where that may lead. Poor, poor Thomas. No, life is too short for hating.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your faith will not survive interrogation, then?’</p>
<p class="indented">She almost laughed then, her face briefly lighting up.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My <em class="calibre2">faith</em>, as you call it, was only ever a way to please him. I would have worshipped the Moon and the Sun and sacrificed a cockerel to the Devil at midnight if that would have made him love me better.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I well remember – you asked my advice on it once,’ I said. ‘But I would advise you not to say as much when you are interviewed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, Bruno.’ She shook her head. ‘Have no fear for me on that account. When I saw that gaol today, I knew without doubt that I could never endure years in such a place for love of the pope. For Jerome, yes, but he would not be here to appreciate it, would he? And the child must survive. That is all that matters now.’ She fell silent then and stared down at her folded hands for a long while. I didn’t dare to move. Eventually she reached into a pocket sewn into her dress and drew out a folded scrap of paper. Stepping across the room towards me, she took my bandaged right hand and pressed the paper into it, holding my hand between hers for a few moments while she looked intently into my eyes. Despite everything, my heart gave a foolish jolt and I was seized by a desire to take her in my arms. The cruelty of the fate that she described reminded me painfully once again of Morgana; I had sentenced a young woman of spirit and beauty to be crushed beneath the wheels of propriety and the injustice of it clutched at my heart. I still clung to the belief that I had saved her life, but I would always live with a tiny kernel of doubt: what if Jerome Gilbert really had meant to escort her to safety in France? I would never be wholly sure and neither would she; that uncertainty bound us together, and I felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility for her. If there was anything I could do to help her now, I determined that I would not let her down again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Write to me,’ she whispered, glancing nervously towards the door in case her father should overhear. ‘Tell me how he died, what he said on the scaffold. That is all I wish. This is the address of my aunt in Kent. I will be taken there tomorrow and I do not think I will ever return to Oxford.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Surely your father would not banish you for good?’</p>
<p class="indented">She shook her head, her lips pressed tight.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You do not know my father. If you could do this one thing …’ She let the sentence trail away and squeezed my hand gently; I tried not to wince.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Bruno.’ Her wide eyes roved over mine as if searching for something. ‘If you had only come to Oxford two years ago – how different everything might have been. Perhaps we … But it is no good dwelling on what might have been. It is too late now for me.’ She leaned forward and kissed me softly on the cheek, so gently that I might have imagined the brush of her lips over my skin. She squeezed my hand once more and let go.</p>
<p class="indented">As I turned towards the door, my heart so heavy I felt stooped by the weight of it, she whispered, ‘Write!’ I looked back to see her miming writing on the palm of her hand, her face stretched into a brave attempt at a smile. I nodded and turned my back on her for the last time.</p>
<p class="indented">When I closed the door behind me, the rector was still standing in the same position, silhouetted against the window, but he had turned to face the room and kept his arms folded across his chest, his small beady eyes fixed on me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So, Doctor Bruno, I have you to thank for delivering the college from a brutal murderer and a seditious Jesuit.’ His tone was oddly unemotional, as though all capacity for feeling had drained out of him; I could not tell if he were pleased by this or not, and the ambiguity of his words made me pause.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You know, Rector, that the two were not the same person?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know that Gabriel Norris – I cannot think of him any other way – is to be charged with the murders of Roger Mercer, James Coverdale, Ned Lacy and Thomas Allen, and with treasonable intent towards Her Majesty’s person. I have learned, too, that there are other accusations made against him, perhaps of less interest to the Privy Council but none the less of considerable significance to my own family.’</p>
<p class="indented">Here he drew in a great shuddering breath that seemed as if it would wrack his very soul; briefly his eyes met mine and I saw in them a weight of sorrow that I understood would burden him the remainder of his natural life. I also understood, in that moment, that Sophia had spoken the truth; there was a degree of coldness in the rector that would allow him to cut her off for good if he felt it necessary. In his eyes I saw the grief of a man who has already lost both his children. I wanted to intercede with him, to plead on her behalf, but decided to hold my tongue; my interference in the business of this college and especially this family was perhaps sufficient.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not think we will see you in Oxford again, Doctor Bruno,’ he said stiffly, holding out a hand for me to shake as he walked across to the main door, the boards creaking under his feet in the silence. ‘In the light of recent events, I regret not confiding in you sooner, but here in Oxford we are not accustomed to regarding foreigners as – well, you see my position.’ He held the hand out more insistently and I reached out to take it, whereupon he grasped my hand between both of his and fixed me with an imploring stare. Sophia had been fortunate, I thought as we looked at one another, that she had taken all her looks from her mother. Or perhaps not so fortunate; had she been less beautiful, her situation now might be very different.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Among my many regrets, Doctor Bruno,’ he continued, seeming to shrink slightly as he held tight to my hand, ‘I could wish I had been a more gracious host and friend to you. Had I known of your connections – but I have much to reprimand myself for, as you may imagine. But perhaps if you have the opportunity to convey to the Earl of Leicester that I have only ever tried to serve him and the university to the best of my ability, that would not be too much to ask? I expect to hear from him concerning these events, and I am not at all sure of how he will receive the news.’ His eyes grew wide with fear as he wrung my arm urgently, unaware that he was even doing so.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would help you if I could, but I’m afraid you mistake my intimacy with the earl – I have never met him in my life.’ Seeing his disappointment, I quickly added, ‘but I’m sure that if I discuss these matters with Sir Philip, he will not be ignorant of your loyalty.’</p>
<p class="indented">The rector nodded solemnly and released my hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you. It is more than I deserve. You were a most worthy adversary in the debating hall, Doctor Bruno. I only wish we might have had the opportunity again.’</p>
<p class="indented">You have a short memory, I thought, as I smiled politely; I was your superior in substance and conduct, though it pleased you to ridicule me before the entire congregation of the university. But that humiliation seemed a trivial thing now.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is one favour I must ask of you in return,’ I said, as we approached the door. He looked at me with mild surprise. ‘I have learned that Cobbett has been suspended from his duties.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is correct,’ the rector said. ‘Master Slythurst made a most serious complaint that he deliberately disregarded orders to hand over sensitive documents and allowed a thief to escape college who might otherwise have been detained.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stared at him, incredulous.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But surely you know, Rector, that the thief he describes was me? And if Cobbett had not disobeyed Slythurst to get an urgent message to Sir Philip, I would be dead by now, and so would your daughter!’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nevertheless,’ said the rector, in the same flat voice, affecting to become absorbed in a loose thread on his gown, ‘Master Slythurst is a senior Fellow of this college, and as a college servant, Cobbett’s duty was to obey his orders, not those of a visitor who had been found removing items from a student’s room. For that dereliction of duty he has been punished.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Those papers, in Sir Philip’s hands, saved your daughter’s life,’ I said, lowering my voice. ‘In Slythurst’s hands, they might not have done so in time. Cobbett acted according to his conscience and for this he should be rewarded.’</p>
<p class="indented">Underhill stopped picking at his gown and fixed me with a direct stare.</p>
<p class="indented">‘In your opinion,’ he replied, enunciating each word carefully and precisely.</p>
<p class="indented">I could not believe what I was hearing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘His actions saved Sophia from being murdered,’ I repeated, more slowly in case he had not understood the first time. ‘And your grandchild,’ I added deliberately, since this did not seem to provoke a response. ‘You do not think that is worth rewarding?’</p>
<p class="indented">For a moment he did not answer but continued to look at me with something like pity.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It has never occurred to you that I might rather have rewarded the man who could have spared my family all this?’</p>
<p class="indented">It took the space of a heartbeat for me to comprehend what he was saying; when I did, I could hardly credit it.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You would have wished me not to interfere?’ I shook my head in disbelief. ‘You do understand that he meant to kill her? Jerome Gilbert – Gabriel Norris, whatever you want to call him? His intention was to have her drowned on the way to France to spare himself the ignominy of discovery. In time, you and your wife would have received a letter saying she had run away to join a religious order and you would have been none the wiser.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you do not think her mother would have found that easier to bear?’ He took a step towards me, and I saw that all his poise was on the verge of shattering; his hands trembled violently and he clasped them together until his knuckles turned white. ‘We could at least have gone into our old age benignly deceived. Instead, my daughter is arrested in the company of a Jesuit missionary and escorted back to Oxford by the Sheriff’s men. I have to go to the Castle gaol in person to pay for her release, where I find her in the company of thieves and whores. Then I must escort her back to college in full view of all the town, I must endure their jeers and whispers as we pass, as my wife will endure them should she ever venture out of her room again, which is doubtful. I would be a fool to believe the rumours are not already in full flood. I will be known hereafter as the father of a Jesuit’s whore, grandsire to a papist bastard. My reputation in the university is finished, and her mother’s nerves will not bear this new assault, I fear.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked at him with contempt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Better she had been quietly murdered, and your reputation survived unblemished?’ I said, through my teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No doubt you think me a monster for saying so,’ he replied, with no trace of apology. ‘But you have no children, so you cannot know the pain of losing them. My daughter is dead to me in any case, Bruno. Better she had been lost at sea and her mother spared this shame. Yes, I think so. Better for Sophia, too. She will have no kind of a life after this.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you would rather have gone on harbouring a Jesuit in the college and living well from his fees, if it meant an easy life? Or perhaps you knew about Norris all along?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No – that is a lie!’ he cried, springing forward. ‘I had no idea about Norris. Perhaps that in itself is a grave failing, but I would never knowingly have tolerated an active missionary in the college, it is absurd to suggest so. I pray you, do not repeat that suggestion to your friend Sir Philip. Norris paid his way and he was granted no more or less licence than the other commoners.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Norris was recommended for a place here by Edmund Allen,’ I said, ‘a man you already knew to be a secret Catholic. And Norris never attended chapel – did that not strike you as suspicious?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The sons of gentlemen are not used to rising early. It is one of their privileges that they are not expected to.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Every dispensation may be bought here,’ I said, looking at him with scorn. ‘It reminds me so much of Rome. But you knew about the others, too, didn’t you?’</p>
<p class="indented">He sighed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I knew about William Bernard. But everyone in Oxford did – it was no secret that he kept to the old ways, though he took the Oath. But he was a recalcitrant old man and judged harmless. He is fled, by the way, but I don’t think there will be too much of a hunt put out for him. To put a white-haired old fellow like that in gaol or stand him on a scaffold does not play well with the people, as the Privy Council knows. And the others – I suppose when I am questioned about Norris I must reveal their names?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not think that will be necessary,’ I said, reeling from his callous words about Sophia. ‘The names of the worst offenders are already known.’</p>
<p class="indented">He studied me as he reached for the door handle.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have too much compassion, Doctor Bruno, to be embroiled in this business. I know that you lied to spare my daughter a public trial. Just as I could have handed the Catholics here, the whole lot of them, over to the pursuivants years ago, but I thought we could all rub along together. I see now one has to be ruthless, and for men like us, it is not in our character. You are like me in that regard,’ he added, with a hint of self-satisfaction.</p>
