				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack walked towards the town of Bushire with pride. Sarah Draper had slipped her arm through his as they left the British encampment. It was an innocent enough gesture, yet he savoured the feeling of walking with such a beautiful woman. It had earned him many jealous glares from the other officers who were diverting themselves by visiting the recently captured town. He had heard little to recommend the place, but when Sarah had suggested paying a visit, he had been unable to deny her. Now that they had left the encampment behind, he had begun to enjoy the temporary reprieve from Ballard and his quest to find the spy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The assault on Reshire and the subsequent capture of the nearest large town had given the army some respite from the rigours of the campaign. Yet despite their efforts, the men would not have an opportunity to enjoy their hard-earned rest. Stalker had issued orders for a wide defensive trench to be dug across the narrow neck of land that separated the swampy peninsula on which Bushire sat from the mainland. It was to be three feet deep and six feet wide, and the earth was to be thrown up to form a sturdy parapet. The redcoats might curse as they blistered their hands digging at the soft, friable soil, but the defensive position was necessary to protect the stationary army from landward attack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In order to give them warning of any such Persian incursion, cavalry pickets had been established a few miles inland. The expeditionary force could only boast two regiments of cavalry, the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry and the Poona Horse. Both had been worked hard. Thus far there had been little sign of the enemy, and it appeared that, for the moment at least, the British army would be allowed some time to recover from the exertions of their initial invasion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The navy had used the lull in operations to bring the army up to strength, even though the largest ships in the fleet were obliged to lie three miles offshore, the presence of sandbanks close to the harbour at Bushire forcing them to ferry everything ashore on smaller craft. No matter what the difficulties, the navy had worked hard to build up the army’s supplies. Thanks to their efforts, the tired redcoats now spent their nights under canvas, the long-awaited tents having finally arrived with the equipment and rations the army would need to strike inland.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With their men fully engaged digging the defences, the British officers had been granted permission to spend their time at leisure. Yet the Bushire peninsula failed to impress. Any hopes of the town itself being a pleasing diversion soon faded. The first few officers curious enough to explore its labyrinthine network of streets and alleys found little there to interest them. It was deemed a miserable place, full of mean peasant hovels, with the British residency the only substantial building of any quality. The town was surrounded by wide swathes of marshland and swamp, the only good land already occupied by the ever-growing British encampment. Heading further inland was out of the question, so the bored officers were limited to bathing in the sea and hunting the local birds and waterfowl. The encampment echoed to the sound of gunfire as the overzealous hunters amongst the officers slaughtered anything with wings. It might not have been good for the local wildlife, but at least the daily haul could be used to supplement the dreary rations provided by the ships.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Yet it appeared that change was in the air. The army was still reacting to the news that Major General Stalker had not long left in command. The government had decided to up the ante, and already a second division was on its way from Bombay to reinforce the troops that had carried out the invasion. With the second division would come the recently gazetted Lieutenant General Sir James Outram, an experienced officer who had made his name in the First Afghan War when, as a junior officer, he had captured an enemy colour at the Battle of Ghazni. Since then his career had flourished, and his defence of Hyderabad against eight thousand Baluchis during the Sind uprising had made him one of the most famous of all Queen Victoria’s generals.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Outram and the second division would land in the coming days with express orders to take the fight to the Persians. The objectives of the campaign had not changed. With two divisions at his disposal, Outram could maintain a more aggressive operation, and the larger force would help convince the Shah that the British would not back down until he had agreed to terms that would force him to relinquish his hold on Herat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The arrival of their new commander would surely put an end to the expeditionary force’s temporary respite. Already orders had arrived for the battalions to begin a series of daily route marches once the defensive preparations were complete; Outram seemed determined to prevent the redcoats and the native infantry from going soft.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Captain Fenris!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Excuse me a moment.’ Jack made his apology to Sarah and turned to face the hectoring voice that had interrupted their stroll. To his disappointment, she let go of his arm as he did so.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Captain Fenris, it is good to see you again.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack felt his back stiffen as he recognised the naval officer walking towards him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good afternoon, Commodore.’ He saw the pointed look Sarah shot his way as she heard the ice in his tone. He was in no mood to be conciliatory. He had spent the last few days in pointless inactivity, searching the documents he had rescued from the fort at Reshire for any further clue as to the identity of the spy in the British camp. He had found nothing, and the task had him chafing at the bit to do something, anything, other than sit and read more of the same.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Mrs Draper, how lovely to see you again.’ Fetherstone bowed at the waist and fixed Sarah with a warm smile that, much to Jack’s annoyance, she returned in equal measure. If Fetherstone spotted anything awry in finding a lady he knew to be married in the company of an officer who had only just joined his rival’s department, he hid it well. Indeed, he seemed pleased to have bumped into the oddly matched couple.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The naval officer was close to a foot shorter than Jack, who stood straighter to emphasise the difference. Fetherstone seemed not to mind being forced to stare upwards as he tore his eyes from Sarah and focused them on her companion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was older than Jack remembered, his grey hair and whiskers thinning and his face weathered. Yet his eyes twinkled as he saw Jack’s obvious belligerence, the spark of life still very much alive in the clear blue eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I hear Ballard has been working you hard. It cannot be easy for a man of action to be forced to spend his days behind a desk.’ Fetherstone half smiled as he passed comment, clearly hoping to rub Jack up the wrong way.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s part of my job, sir.’ Jack snapped at the lure. ‘I do not mind it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone guffawed at the stiff reply that was just what he had hoped for. ‘I can see he has got you well trained, at least. Did he give you a royal rollicking for joining the attack?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack scowled at the criticism of his commander. ‘I did not take part in the assault.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Come, come, Captain. Please credit naval intelligence with knowing a few things. Your bravery has not gone wholly unnoticed. I hear your actions quite saved the day. I cannot think why Ballard would not let you garner the credit you so clearly deserve, unless he means to punish you, of course. That, at least would make sense, however churlish it may be.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack caught a glimpse of Sarah looking closely at him as the naval officer alluded to his part in the assault on Reshire. He hoped the revelation would impress her. Despite his instinct warning him to be careful, he felt a spark of pride at the recognition that Fetherstone was giving him. Yet it was still a dangerous topic, and he knew he needed to steer the inquisitive intelligence officer away to safer ground.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Major Ballard ordered me to remain out of the fighting, sir. You must have me mistaken for another man.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I rather fancy you are the one who is mistaken if you think I am going to believe that. I am no man’s fool, believe me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m sure you are no fool, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am glad to hear it. So, have you found the spy?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">This time Jack struggled to hide his surprise. ‘I don’t know what you mean, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone’s snort revealed his opinion of Jack’s denial. ‘You would do well to leave the politicking to Ballard, Captain Fenris. You are not cut out for dissembling. You should not be astonished that I know of the presence of a spy. It comes as no great surprise that the Persians have men in our camp. We all know that the Russians are supporting the Shah. They will have taught him all he needs to know about handling such things. Indeed, I would be more surprised if there were no attempts to garner information. What concerns me is that the enemy appears to have access to the very heart of our enterprise here. That is a danger to the success of the campaign, and it is my duty . . .’ he smiled thinly at Jack before continuing, ‘<span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">our</span> duty to discover their identity and root them out before any more harm is done.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Then may I ask what the navy is doing about it?’ Jack lifted his chin as he asked the pointed question.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone was not at all put out. ‘Why, the same as you, I imagine. Judging from your reaction, we are both having the same amount of success.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Perhaps.’ Jack tried to remain non-committal. The commodore was right. He was out of his depth. ‘So you think there is just the one spy?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone scowled. ‘I think it unlikely that even the army is foolish enough to allow more than one. Does Ballard think there are more?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Major Ballard keeps his own counsel.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am sure he does.’ Fetherstone seemed to give the matter some thought. ‘No. It does not make sense, to me at least. One well-placed spy could do much more damage than a dozen poor sources. Why would the enemy risk placing more than one agent? We are looking for one man, I am sure of it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack made a note of Fetherstone’s certainty.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It really is a shame Ballard is so secretive.’ Fetherstone shook his head at Jack’s reluctance to be drawn. ‘It would be better for everyone if our two departments could find a way to work together.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m sure Major Ballard has his reasons, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">For the first time, Fetherstone scowled. ‘The man is clearly paranoid, or deluded; perhaps both. I would like to ensure you are not prejudiced against us. My door is always open to you. If you feel you have information that would be best shared, you must not hesitate to come to me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone smiled at the reaction. ‘You are a loyal soul, Captain. It does you great credit. But sometimes you must think of a higher purpose. You must do what you know to be right, no matter what the cost. Isn’t that so, Sarah?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah’s brow furrowed. ‘I would like to believe I would do what is right.’ Jack heard an unfamiliar trace of timidity in her voice.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone looked at her sharply before continuing, leaving no time for Jack to dwell on her reply. ‘Anyway, I would not wish to delay you. I can see you are out to enjoy a pleasant afternoon’s excursion, although I must warn you that you may not find Bushire to your taste. It is a mean place. There is little to recommend it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded politely. Fetherstone reminded him of a hungry sparrow pecking at the ground in the hope of finding a delicious morsel. No matter how many times he was disappointed, he could not resist pecking some more.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The commodore turned back to Sarah. ‘Mrs Draper, I was wondering if you and your brother would do me the honour of dining aboard tonight. The place hasn’t been the same since you left us.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah bobbed her head in acknowledgement of the gracious comment. ‘We would be delighted.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Wonderful.’ Fetherstone clapped his hands. ‘Until tonight, then.’ He bowed at the waist and left Jack and Sarah alone.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do you really like him?’ Jack asked when he judged Fetherstone to be out of earshot.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah slipped her arm back through his as they turned to resume their walk towards Bushire. ‘He is good company. He looked after me when we were on board his ship. It would’ve been rude to refuse him. Do you mind?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course not.’ Jack was surprised she asked the question.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I shall not stay late.’ She nestled her head against his arm, like a cat brushing against its master. ‘We shall have the night together, I promise.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The idea made Jack smile, and he pushed the meeting with Fetherstone from his mind. ‘Perhaps when you are there you could do something for me.’ He asked the question softly. He was thinking of Ballard’s instruction to help him discover more about the spy plaguing the army. It was clear from their conversation that Fetherstone was working on the same thing. Sarah was certainly clever enough to be able to help him, and if she was going to spend the evening with the leader of the naval intelligence department, perhaps he could ask her to garner some useful intelligence for him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I rather think I am doing enough things to you,’ Sarah teased, lifting her face. ‘I am shocked you would consider asking for more.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Not <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">to</span> me. <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">For</span> me.’ Jack shook his head at her coquettish behaviour. He did not fully understand her wanton streak. He was no shy virgin, but he sometimes found her behaviour somewhat unbecoming. He sensed that she had a deep need for his company, something more than just a desire for the nocturnal activities they shared. Yet she guarded her emotions well, almost as well as he did his. He had yet to penetrate her protective shell, the hard carapace behind which she hid her true feelings. He hoped that with time she would let him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘When you dine with Fetherstone, it would be helpful if you could find out what he knows of any enemy spies.’ Jack made sure he looked at her as he asked the question, trying to read her reaction to his words.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah pouted, his request clearly not to her liking. ‘What is all this fuss about spies? James told me they are almost inevitable in a campaign on enemy soil. I am sure half the local people are reporting back. Surely it makes little difference. It is no great secret that we are here to attack.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. It is more than that.’ Jack wondered how much to reveal. ‘The enemy is somehow getting more than just general observations. It is becoming serious.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘How delicious,’ Sarah purred as she began to understand the intrigue. ‘What about Captain Hunter? You know his father was forced to sell his commission?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was interested. ‘I had no idea.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It was over some affair with his regiment’s accounts. The poor fellow never got over the shame and killed himself when Hunter was a child. They say his ghost haunts their family home, his tortured soul unable to find rest.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That sounds like bollocks to me.’ Jack had no time for such gossip. ‘Hunter seems a decent fellow.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So that precludes him from being a spy?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook his head. ‘I think for now we should concentrate our attention on finding out just what Fetherstone knows rather than throwing slurs on every officer on Stalker’s staff. This is not a game. If the Persians do have a well-placed spy, men will die because of his information.’ He paused, letting the seriousness of his words sink in.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah was silent. It was some moments before she spoke. ‘Cannot Ballard not simply ask Fetherstone what he knows?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. They don’t trust each other.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So it is up to us?’ Sarah was quiet a moment longer before she rallied and squeezed his arm tighter. ‘How very exciting. It will add some wonderful spice to my account.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You mustn’t write about it!’ Jack was appalled. Ballard would have his balls if he found out he had asked Sarah for help. ‘At least not yet. Not until this is all over.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I shall be the soul of discretion.’ Sarah was clearly delighted at being involved in Jack’s scheme. ‘There really is more to you than meets the eye. I think I may have underestimated you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled at the notion. He was pleased to have Sarah on his side. He had a feeling she would be a powerful ally.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They walked in silence as they entered Bushire, content in each other’s company. The street was narrow, with windowless buildings pressed hard on either flank. It was a dank, foreboding place and the muddy ground underfoot was liberally scattered with filth.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fetherstone was right.’ Jack acknowledged the commodore’s warning about Bushire. ‘This place has little to recommend it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fetherstone is often right. You would do well to remember that. You can trust him. You cannot place all your faith in Major Ballard.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Why do you say that?’ Jack stopped in the middle of the road. There was no one else around. Many of the town’s inhabitants had taken to staying in their houses now that the invading army had made its camp on their doorstep.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He has a reputation as a ruthless man who will stoop to any depths to achieve his aims. He will not serve you well.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He could understand why Ballard was thought of in that way, yet during his time with the major he had come to like the man. There was something refreshing in his forthright manner, especially when compared to so many of the callow buffoons Jack had encountered in the British army.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You must be careful not to be used,’ Sarah continued, ‘for he will discard you without a qualm when he has finished with you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack kept his face neutral. He could have levelled the same accusation at Sarah herself. He knew where he stood. He was aware that the time would come when he would be cast out. By both of them. He had been alone too long for that thought to worry him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You do not agree?’ Sarah’s mouth twisted in vexation as she noticed that Jack was ignoring her advice. Jack saw the flash of temper in her pale blue eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I do not.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You think you know it all, don’t you, Arthur? You know about Ballard, about Fetherstone, even about my brother. Is there anyone that surprises you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No.’ He spoke with blunt honesty.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘How very sad.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned and began the long walk back to the British encampment. He had gone no more than a dozen paces when he heard footsteps as Sarah trotted after him. She slipped her arm through his, but said nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He thought about what she had said. He did not know if he could trust Ballard, but he was certain he could not trust Fetherstone. He sighed and placed his hand over Sarah’s, feeling the warmth of her skin underneath his fingers. Fetherstone had been quite correct: he was not cut out for politicking. He could do nothing but trust his own judgement and place his faith, and indeed his life, where he thought it best.</p>
