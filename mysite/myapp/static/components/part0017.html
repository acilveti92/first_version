			<p class="_-head">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, <br class="calibre2"/>March 17th, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I did not suppose this afternoon would be easy or even tolerable. No devoted husband could have imagined it thus. It shames me to say, therefore, that I found events so strangely . . . unrelated to myself, as if John H. Watson were a spectre existing on a thin grey plane and the day had simply ground along without him.</p>
			<p class="bt">It seems that if one is connected to a tragedy intimately enough, perversely, one may as well not be there at all.</p>
			<p class="bt">The earth of the cemetery beneath my boots was dry sand before the gates, grating stone along the paths, dead leaves edging the margins, and finally shivering grasses surrounding the tombstones. Birds called to one another and in the distance oblivious church bells chimed, stopping for no one. Above us, the sky fretted with impending thunder while the gusting winds likewise warned of cataclysms. March is a wicked month in London, I have always felt. Its weather hints at remorseful improvements and then rains glad cruelties upon the heads of all and sundry.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">Stop.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">All this petty vacillation might appear to be what Holmes used to call “color and life,”<span class="charoverride3"> </span>but in reality is much worse than those harmless turns of phrase he so disdained in my fiction-tinged accounts. This is prevarication, delay in stating the inevitable: that I shed no tears, that no one leapt into the pit of clay, that even a dog would have whined, and I did nothing. How much better a man I should think myself if I could have truly <span class="charoverride3">felt</span> any of it! Granted, I had supposed I was prepared for the eventuality of her death, for her illness was unmercifully protracted. Picturing her face two days ago—that sweet countenance with its wasted lips and hollowed eyes at peace finally and forevermore—­gladdens me whenever I fail to succumb to unreasoning selfishness.</p>
			<p class="bt">Yet here I sit, my head and my throat aching, able to write only of the weather.</p>
			<p class="bt">I buried my wife today.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mary would never have demanded this exercise of me, I am sure of it. But there. My own requirements of myself will be met, by heaven. Honesty will be had, if not sensibility.</p>
			<p class="bt">I buried my wife today, and can scarcely set it down, and now will try no further. Had I a heart left to mourn anyone, I should think it fit to wail like a savage at present, rage at the mad moon with my fists raised.</p>
			<p class="bt">The fellow who would have done so being absent, I shall retire and hope some spirit returns to me in my slumber.</p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, <br class="calibre2"/>March 18th, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Reading back over my previous entry, I am thoroughly sick at my own weakness and apathy in the face of fresh bereavement. When others fail to meet my expectations, base complaining is never my response—why then should I carp at the page when I fail to meet my own? There is no course to choose but onward, after all, and I fear no place lower for me to sink.</p>
			<p class="bt">Resolved: to take courage, to honor the departed, to ever seek comfort by means of occupations at which I can be proud in the execution if not happy in the act. Many men and women are allowed no more than this. And can I truly think myself unlucky, when I have loved and been esteemed in return by such valorous spirits as I have encountered in my life?</p>
			<p class="bt">No indeed. I’ve been blessed beyond imagining—to have spent a placid, insipid eternity in lesser company would not be preferable, and I would not choose it. I must remind myself of this. Daily, it seems.</p>
			<p class="bt">In my lowness yesterday, I neglected to record salient details. Mary has been long without kith or kin, and my family is likewise quite ­dissolved—parents in the ground, a brother lost to me years before he destroyed himself. Therefore I expected a modest turnout, for all that my wife was a beacon to those in need, and am glad to say I was mistaken. Mr. and Mrs. Isa Whitney were present, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, several of my own regular patients, the entire Anstruther clan, and a gratifying number of neighbors who wept most touchingly during interludes in which I found myself numb as a fence post. It was to my own considerable surprise, therefore, that I felt so roused by a reedy and familiar voice just after the ceremony had ended.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Doctor Watson! I’ll not say I’m glad to see you, for I’m nothing but sorry under the circumstances. But by George, it’s good to find myself in your company.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Turning, I encountered none other than Inspector Lestrade. His close-set eyes shone bright as polished marbles, hard and canny as usual—yet beneath the shrewdness, there lay considerable sympathy which in no way resembled pity. I’ve always liked Lestrade heartily in such moments of candor, when he isn’t fuming with pique or preening like a lapdog, and I gripped his hand harder than I’d meant to. When I am not in Lestrade’s company, I don’t think often of him. When I am, I wonder at this lapse, as he is equally as compassionate as he is forgettable, and I simply like the fellow, and it isn’t as if I possess any remarkable characteristics myself that would justify my putting on airs. The remarkable one left us years ago.</p>
			<p class="bt">We exchanged unbearably polite remarks regarding Mary’s final weeks and what luck the rain had forestalled. Finally, I cut the chap off in mid-platitude. I’d begun to sense a despairing roar lodged in my lungs, writhing to escape, and thought best to prevent its release.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Lestrade, thank you for coming. Though as to how you knew to be here—the obituaries yesterday, I presume?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lestrade smiled his terrier’s smile and swung his hands behind his back, clasping them. The familiar gesture pleased me. He looked well, despite his habitual wearied brow and twitching chin.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Aye,” he owned. “Though for all that some folk never held my brains in much esteem, I’d have known something was amiss anyhow. You’d used to stop by so often to compare our case notes, twice a week at the least, and lately . . .” Trailing off, he shrugged slender shoulders.</p>
			<p class="bt">Lestrade was right, of course, and must have missed me. It seems that I have been neglectful of my few remaining friends. Thanks to twenty-four ardently penned chronicles of my friend’s cases published between July of 1891, just after I had lost him, and December of 1893, when I understood I was to lose Mary as well, I’d become something of a fixture at the Yard.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I ought to have wired you,” I said with regret. “Don’t take offense, please, but there were pressing matters on my mind.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not another word! You’ve been needed elsewhere. Obituaries, ha—a good guess, that. You’ll make a detective yet someday, Doctor.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The cast of my face must have shifted from unwell to ashen, for he likewise paled and, pressing my arm, said, “My apologies—I’d no wish to rattle you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You haven’t,” I sighed. “I’m merely fatigued, I expect.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“God save us, ‘fatigued’<span class="charoverride3"> </span>can’t begin to describe it. You’re the last man in Christendom I’d have wished these past three years on, Dr. Watson, and if I’ve broached a subject which offended—”</p>
			<p class="bt">I shook my head; for he had brought up an old wound, a close and familiar hurt that reassured me rather than rent. Or so I always tell myself it ought to do. Some pains blanket us, it seems, dulling the senses, and others we clutch to us like daggers sunk hilt-deep. In my mind’s eye, a very thin man rubbed his hands together, grey eyes aglow, whilst he angled his head at the inspector as an alert sparrow studies a likely worm.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, no,” I replied, shifting. “Not at all. And now you mention it, I am indeed at work upon another tale. You recall that dreadful business over the Abernetty family?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Narrowing his eyes, Lestrade attempted another cautious smile. It was to cheer me, not to ingratiate himself, and I liked him all the better for it. “Well, of course I do. What a ghastly case that was, to be sure! I can hardly think of it without my skin crawling. You’re really writing it up?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Horrid affair.” He shuddered. “Why, that case happened very soon before . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Before Switzerland, yes. I’ve been writing of him constantly these three years—you needn’t avoid Sherlock Holmes’s name so. Please dine with me.” I gestured at the exit of the churchyard, where well-meaning folk averted their eyes from my face in respectful silence, kerchiefs pressed to the salt on their cheeks. “If I stay here an instant longer, I’ll go mad, and anyhow I’ve not eaten in . . . Do you know, Lestrade, I can’t think how long. I really am forming detective-like qualities. Sleepless nights, and now eschewing meals? It won’t do at all. Come along and remind me of the exact details of the parsley clue.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lestrade shook his head as he preceded me away from the obscenely fresh grave. “I’ll never forgive Mr. Holmes, you realize, for that one—I couldn’t make head nor tail of it before the blasted butter gave all away. Made a complete ass of myself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We both did.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, pish, you know as well as I do you weren’t the one who tried to convince England’s highest-strung logician that there’s such a thing as murderous ghosts.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Half-smiling, I admitted, “I didn’t suppose he’d approve that theory, no. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t frightened.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, you didn’t show it. What a spineless little rabbit he must have thought me!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He didn’t, not at all. He even said as much.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, come, there’s no need to rag me over it,” Lestrade scoffed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, it’s true—he once mentioned you after you were frightened of the hound, that horrible night out on the moors at Baskerville Hall. Holmes said had you not been scared for your skin, he’d have thought you far dimmer than he’d supposed, but that it was sheer bull-headed nerve got you up again. He admired that. He didn’t phrase it very kindly, but then he never did, did he?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Spots of color appeared on Lestrade’s cheeks and he cleared his throat loudly into his gloved fist. “No. From Sherlock Holmes, that’s practically a medal of honor. Thank you for telling me. Sometimes I’m curious whether the man himself was ever afraid in his life—is it any wonder his standards were so high? <span class="charoverride3">Was</span> he made of clockwork, Doctor, or did you ever see the worst ones affect him?”</p>
			<p class="bt">I thought of Holmes striding into my consulting room with an unhealthy translucence to his skin—not even greeting me, though he looked me over with as much care as he would any client—and then flinging all my shutters closed as if they had personally offended him.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“You are afraid of something?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Well, I am.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Of what?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Of air-guns.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, the worst ones affected him,” said I. “Quickly now, there’s a decent chophouse just this way, and the rain is starting.”</p>
			<p class="bt">We arrived without incident at a pub with tarnished mirrors and a charred atmosphere. Chestnut husks crunched beneath my boot soles. Some sort of food I cannot recall passed my lips as the inspector talked on briskly of the Abernetty case, his cadences as familiar as the ticking of my pocket watch.</p>
			<p class="bt">It was a tremendous kindness. I never told him that I recalled every detail as if it were yesterday, and—though he knew as much—he never reminded me of the fact.</p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the unpublished manuscript <br class="calibre2"/>“The Adventure of the Abernetty Family”:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3"><span class="charoverride3">“I know you’ve never believed in evil spirits, Mr. Holmes,” Lestrade said, jerkily tugging at his cuffs. I had seen the inspector irritable countless times, but never had I seen him so unnerved. “I didn’t either—I don’t, I mean, that is to say. But you can see all that I can see, still more I’ve no doubt, and God help us, if ever a man did watch a curse ravage a household, it would look exactly like this.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">Sherlock Holmes, his </span><span class="charoverride9">expressive mouth</span><span class="charoverride3"> thin brows drawn together </span><span class="charoverride9">in a taut line</span><span class="charoverride3">, shook his head emphatically. The sun seeping through the half-pulled curtains of the ill-fated Abernetty house was now well past its meridian, and my friend had taken on the air of a tethered greyhound straining against the implacable grip of its leash. The sinews beneath the quiet tailoring of his coat were tense with anticipation. Now that the three bodies found in various attitudes of grisly agony in the allegedly haunted abode had been examined and taken away, and the most minute search for traces of a poisoning agent come to nothing, the passion beneath Holmes’s phlegmatic exterior had grown more visible by steady degrees.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“I just mean,” Lestrade again attempted, his lean face likewise tight with worriment, “that supposing the Devil had a hand in the affairs of—”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“It won’t wash!” Holmes exclaimed, striking an impatient fist against his palm. Waving his hand as if in </span><span class="charoverride9">regret</span><span class="charoverride3"> dismissal </span><span class="charoverride9">at</span><span class="charoverride3"> of his outburst, he leaned against the windowsill. “These circumstances may have all the trappings of a lurid ghost story, but only children are untutored enough to actually be frightened of spectres. Let us sum up, so as to clarify our thoughts: five members of a family said to be accursed owing to their bloodthirsty dealings in the South American coffee trade are dead—the ruthless patriarch at his offices, the complicit mother at an art benefit, the innocent sisters over cards here in their parlor. Time of death for all five was practically simultaneous despite the three separate murder scenes. Now. I grant you that the Devil may have inspired such events, but he never executed them.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Then who did?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“I am not yet certain. I need more data, not fanciful embellishments of facts which are already before us.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“But it is impossible, I tell you, that they should all have been struck down at once despite being miles apart.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Of course it isn’t impossible!” Holmes flung his arms wide. “What heights of rarefied nonsense are you subjecting me to today, Lestrade? Are you through with them, or should I fear further inanities? It happened, </span>ad oculos, <span class="charoverride3">therefore it is possible. The Abernetty family was poisoned.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“How?” Lestrade pleaded. “We’ve found nothing at any of the crime scenes to indicate such. And the servants might be foreigners, right enough, but the individual accounts they give corroborate each other—nothing save the usual midnight shrieks and freakish alteration of clock hands and such has been afoot. Are you telling me that invisible assassins drove needles simultaneously into—”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Lestrade, you flatter </span><span class="charoverride9">my mind’s expansiveness</span><span class="charoverride3"> me, but even I have not such a fanciful imagination as </span>that<span class="charoverride3">,” my friend groaned. “Simplicity is much more elegant. They all died within five minutes of each other. Therefore, they were commonly poisoned and the effect was inexplicably delayed.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“I cannot think of any poison to match such terribly grotesque symptoms,” I put in, greatly troubled. Just contemplating what the three sisters’ final moments must have been like sent hoarfrost down my spine. Their corpses would live in my nightmares, I was already certain of it. “They all suffered acute respiratory distress, fluid on the lungs, and seizures before finally suffocating before one another’s very eyes. I’ve never seen anything like it before in all my days—it’s as if they drowned on dry land.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Precisely so!” Lestrade cried. “What horrible drug could have achieved such an effect?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“I know of none. What causes drowning in the midst of a clear blue day? It isn’t arsenic, cyanide, belladonna, any of the common—”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Watson,” Holmes demanded with exquisite asperity, “were this crime of the common herd, would </span>I<span class="charoverride3"> be here?”</span></p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, <br class="calibre2"/>March 23rd, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I had expected by this time a return of appetite if not relish, and comfort in writing of Holmes despite the fact that the exercise often feels like pressing upon my old injury. Neither has resulted so far.</p>
			<p class="bt">I begin to wonder what, if anything, I can do to pull myself from this mire of stupefaction.</p>
			<p class="bt">My twice-yearly rendezvous with Mrs. Hudson took place as usual, at the tea shop on the corner of Baker Street and Melcombe Street, despite the fact she had written me to say that I need not come if I was unable. I could think of no plausible excuse, however, not even for myself, and so assured her that I was quite well enough and met her over thin sandwiches and an excellent pot of Ceylon.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, you poor dear,” she said, embracing me when I reached the low chintz-covered table. “My most heartfelt condolences, Dr. Watson. If there’s anything, anything at all—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’m fine, Mrs. Hudson.” I hung my hat on a peg. “You look very well.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She looked precisely the same—Mrs. Hudson has a crown of snowy hair and a perfectly oval face, bright blue eyes, and amiable, even features which must have gladdened the late Mr. Hudson’s heart whenever he saw them, the lucky chap. I thought she must have been pretty and knew she must have been slyly clever as well as shy. While she had always treated Holmes as if she had a tame dragon for a lodger—deferential, admiring, cautious—she also held considerable affection for him, and for me by extension.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, I’m sorry to tell you that I can’t return the compliment. You look almost as thin as when you took rooms in Baker Street, and you’ve dreadful dark circles under your eyes,” she fretted, pouring the tea. “I do wish you would come to two-twenty-one, Doctor, and let me cook you a hearty meal for the sake of old times.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Though I smiled, I said nothing—for Mrs. Hudson knows why I will not visit her there, and our talk turned to other matters.</p>
			<p class="bt">Our former rooms have been kept as a strange monument to my lost friend by his brother, Mycroft Holmes, a man of most narrow and concentrated habits. More accurately, Mycroft is an acolyte at the temple of fixed daily patterns. I could not help but conclude that even the practice of having a brother had become so ingrained in the poor soul that he simply refused to act as if he didn’t have one any longer. This was the only sensible explanation I could conjure, for Mycroft was seven years Sherlock’s elder, and must have been a great influence on him. Surely the loss of a gifted younger sibling he had protected in youth would be enough to tilt even a great mind—perhaps especially a great mind—a few degrees off kilter. Thus the sitting room, my old room, even Holmes’s bedchamber were regularly dusted, paid for monthly by the elder Mr. Holmes, and madly, miserably empty.</p>
			<p class="bt">As tragic as this was, it would be perjury to suggest I found his behavior shocking. Though the peculiar siblings utterly forswore demonstrative sentiment, they were in their own silent fashion devoted to each other, and the immaculate preservation of 221B proves as much. Mrs. Hudson probably feels like the caretaker of a highly specialized museum, and in a way she is.</p>
			<p class="bt">If the mummification of our lodgings makes Mycroft Holmes feel that his brother is alive, well and good. I write short stories. The measures are not dissimilar. But I cannot be in those rooms again. Not unchanged, not after all he suffered, not as if Sherlock Holmes had not begged me to leave him behind for my own safety for half an hour in the Strasbourg <span class="charoverride3">salle à manger,</span> not as if he had never looked at me with an unidentifiable shadow over his brow, half-obscured by an attempted smile, and remarked, <span class="charoverride3">“I think I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt">“After your last publication came out, I worried for you,” Mrs. Hudson was saying. Plucking myself from my reverie, I poured her more tea. “It was Christmas and all, and that choice of topic . . . It didn’t sound like you, Doctor.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘The Final Problem’?” I picked up an egg sandwich, took a bite, and set it down again. “I thought it sounded rather like me—at least, it sold very well.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The kindly old woman bit her lip, nodding, and I mentally chided myself for my incivility.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Please forgive me. It was high time, Mrs. Hudson.” Taking her hand, I smiled as best I could. “I am still writing of our exploits, do not doubt it. However, when Mary’s ever-worsening condition was considered . . . well, I had begun to sense that I must look life square in the face, in all matters, and that is what I did. What I will continue to do, without undue morbidity or self-pity. I promise you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She pressed my hand and returned my warm expression. “You’ve eased my mind, then, and I thank you for that. And I’ll trouble you no more over what can’t be remedied anyhow. I’ve one more question, though—why on earth did you write that you had never heard of Professor Moriarty?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tricks of the trade, Mrs. Hudson,” I returned affably, making a manful effort at the remaining sandwich fragment. “Explain too much at the start and the reader revolts.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, I see. It was better for the story that you didn’t know.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The memory of a Swiss boy—out of breath, cherry-cheeked, eager—caused my vision momentarily to lose focus. Three years ago, Holmes thumped his Alpine-stock against the grass and gave me a resigned shrug.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“No, no, go on back to Meiringen, my dear fellow. This lad will keep me from straying off of any cliffsides, and you shall catch me up at Rosenlaui. We’ve seen the Falls, and anyway I must not be selfish. Surely if the unfortunate woman wants her last memory to be that of a kindly English doctor easing her path into the undiscovered country, you cannot deny either her excellent tastes or her wishes in the matter, can you?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt">I pressed my thumb so hard into my wrist that I could feel the bruise forming, took a breath, and sipped my tea.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You have it exactly, Mrs. Hudson.” Edging the plate toward her, I watched her take another cress sandwich. “It was better for the story that I didn’t know.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Walking toward the Underground after I left her, I thought well of my vow to my former landlady. It was the best I could make and no better, but I believe it an efficacious one nonetheless. Once finished with this journal entry, I shall put myself to a more useful occupation and continue work on the Abernetty matter. It is not as if—my mind having been so thoroughly consumed with my wife for these six months and more—I’ve any patients to distract me.</p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the unpublished manuscript <br class="calibre2"/>“The Adventure of the Abernetty Family”:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3"><span class="charoverride3">“But nothing!” Inspector </span><span class="charoverride10">L</span><span class="charoverride3">estrade growled in the front hall, arms burrowing into his coat sleeves. “There is no evidence here to find, I tell you—you cannot contradict me.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“I think you’ll find that I can,” Holmes snapped.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Then you would be wrong for the first time, and what of that! It’s useless. And either all the servants are telling the truth, and spiteful phantoms meddled with timekeeping and lost books and unravelled hems and put salt in the sugar bowl for years, or else all the servants are lying. In either case, best of luck. I’m for the morgue, where pray God they’ve made some progress with the bodies. Anyway, it’ll be a sight more cheerful than this wretched place.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">My friend gnawed at his cheek for a moment, but soon gave up the matter as lost. “Go on, then. Wire me the instant you have news. I shall remain here and find what is missing.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“What could possibly be missing, Mr. Holmes?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“The answer, for the love of heaven!” the detective cried.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">Shaking his head, Inspector Lestrade departed, slamming the front door behind him.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Come, Watson.” Holmes sighed, fingers pressing winglike at the bridge of his arched nose. He walked down the hall and I followed, deeply discouraged. “Back to work.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">Holmes </span><span class="charoverride9">seemed to fall</span><span class="charoverride3"> fell into an uncharacteristic reverie upon re-­entering the parlor where the three young Misses Abernetty had been discovered. </span><span class="charoverride9">The air in this room was thick with the intangible atmosphere of recent death—not an aroma, but a feeling like an echo of stopped watches, of missed trains, of misdirected love letters, of all that will now never come to pass</span><span class="charoverride3">. He shook his sable head, jaw tense with chagrin.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“You and I may not credit curses,” I mused, my eyes likewise upon the arrangement of spent hands of whist and scattered tea things, “but despite the fact the strange events in this household smack of chicanery and harassment rather than demonic influence, there is certainly a depressing air about rooms where young people have died untimely.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride9">“Quite so,” Holmes agreed, squinting somberly at the table. “For a man who drove Amazonian tribes to slaughter one another wholesale, all to swell his already fat coffers, to be struck down—the universe approves of balanced sowing and reaping. I cannot help but think it fitting that a greedy sensualist who made it his practice to incite evil in others should himself be felled by an evil deed. But the daughters were blameless. That they should have died so, having committed no sin worthy of such a punishment, is offensive to the rational soul.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">My friend froze over the tabletop, his lips parted on a stifled gasp and his slender hands floating with palms down before him. He could have been Moses readying himself to divide the waters, or a magician casting his final hex over a bubbling potion.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Whatever’s the matter?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Watson, look!” he cried. “The parsley has sunk into the butter!”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“But what of that?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Watson,” he hissed, gripping my wrist convulsively, “it is </span>scientifically impossible<span class="charoverride3"> for parsley to sink into butter.”</span></p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, <br class="calibre2"/>March 25th, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">If I continue no better, at least I continue no worse. But God, how weary, stale, flat, unprofitable, etc. . . .</p>
			<p class="bt">My poor friend always claimed that finding the line of least resistance was the starting point of every problem; he insisted that once the astute reasoner discerned a path by identifying an anomaly, blazing a trail through the bracken would prove simple thereafter. It is this very belief that has begun to chill me of late. I see no gentle byways, no sinuous and subtle markings in the landscape whereby traversing them the weary wanderer might glimpse a friendly spark of light through a many-paned cottage window.</p>
			<p class="bt">But I stray from the point. Hearing Holmes’s voice commanding, as he had used to do, “Refrain from poetry, Watson, it hardly suits at the moment,” I shall make a better effort to explain myself, if only to myself.</p>
			<p class="bt">I have been considered a bold campaigner. Every man finds himself at times without a map to guide him, however. Returning from the Second Afghan War, I felt aimless—until I quite by chance met a crusader fully as solitary as I and discovered that, while his greatness of character far exceeded my own, our temperaments were so wildly antithetical as to be perfectly matched, and thus I felt enormous pride at being recruited to serve upon the singular missions of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. At the loss of this latter commander, I felt similarly directionless, and I mourned him with all my heart, though I could not actually bury him. I had a wife then, however, one as warm as the sun around which more minor bodies orbit, and thus retained a certain groundedness in spite of my grief.</p>
			<p class="bt">One sees patients, one runs his household, one kisses his beautiful spouse when he finds her lost in one of his seafaring novels, caresses her hair where it gleams like the tufts of midsummer meadow grasses, blesses the fact she was ever born in the first place, and one remains tied to the gritty ache of life on earth and heartily glad to be so.</p>
			<p class="bt">Having now lost Mary, I cannot but feel as if the very laws of gravity have deserted me. I may as well be Holmes, and have erased the principle from the garret of my mind.</p>
			<p class="bt">Confound it, I appear to have resorted to poetry after all.</p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, March 30th, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3"><span class="charoverride3">Enough</span>.</p>
			<p class="bt">Seeing a patient out the door this morning with a tonic, a prescription, and a false smile, I returned to lock up my small private stores and found my eyes lingering on the cocaine bottle.</p>
			<p class="bt">Reprehensible. And this after all my hard urgings on poor Holmes, whose lambent mind was capable of inventing torments I could no better comprehend than I could prevent.</p>
			<p class="bt">I find I cannot even write of him with pleasure at present, and that is the hardest blow of all. At the time of the Abernetty business, he was in the thick of preparing to topple James Moriarty’s empire, and dreams of waterfalls and Alpine-stocks grow more unbearable nightly.</p>
			<p class="bt">I can continue like this no longer, I have concluded, and have thus set certain plans in motion. Let me say no more at present, but I harbor hopes for recovery.</p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, <br class="calibre2"/>April 3rd, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">A note arrived from Lestrade day before yesterday suggesting that I could earn a few extra quid per year assisting the Yard in a medical capacity. He knows my practice has suffered heavy blows following my wife’s decline. It was well thought of, and for that reason have I turned him down in person.</p>
			<p class="bt">I appeared in his familiar office with hat in hand and was quickly waved into a chair. Lestrade, prim lips pursed in concentration, was penning a telegram. He finished the task with that air of officiousness, which always used to amuse me and to chafe my late friend, one I was happy to see again, and then clapped his hands with an expectant expression.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Unpleasantries must be seen to first: I fear that I cannot take you up on your generous offer,” I told him. “I have been to the maritime offices today and there answered several advertisements for ships’ surgeons. My prospects are very good indeed. As I’m better than qualified, I’ve every expectation of gaining a berth.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lestrade, poor fellow, was most dismayed and attempted to dissuade me. But my mind was made up. He argued and spluttered and harangued for a quarter of an hour, and this when I had never before consulted him over so much as a train timetable. It is a lesson I shall take to heart not to misplace my friends once I have made them, for I cannot think of anyone else in London who would have so powerfully attempted to keep me here. When I had finally steered him round to my view of the matter, he rose and clasped my hand over his desk, frowning darkly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ll stop by for a pint before you make any final arrangements?” he pressed me.</p>
			<p class="bt">I assured him that I would and stepped out into the thin light of Whitehall Place easier in my mind despite the disproportionate heaviness of my heart. It is the right choice—the only true choice. Now all that remains is to see it through.</p>
			<p class="bt">My restless soul cannot wait to be packing a trunk, gaining a certificate of my own health from Anstruther, and leasing my practice until I decide whether or not I will ever want it back again. Holmes’s spirit inhabits these ancient cobbles as deeply as he inhabits my memory, and Mary’s gentle presence brushes her small fingers along every corridor of my house and practice. The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that hurt as much as they delight. Once or twice, I had thought fleetingly of returning to California or even India, but such measures appear distastefully nostalgic.</p>
			<p class="bt">What I seek cannot be found by traveling backward.</p>
			<p class="bt">Soon I will be at sea. My skills are apt to the life, I think, at least temporarily. If they are not, I shall be tested, that is all, and this is what my circumstances demand: a place and a purpose.</p>
			<p class="bt">I am a man who must be put to some <span class="charoverride3">use.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">This morning I remembered a particular occasion in 1886 when Holmes had been in the dumps for four weary days, scraping his fiddle and ignoring my pained looks every time his morocco case made its sinister appearance. After an interminable interlude which would have tried the patience of a saint, let alone myself, he sat down at the breakfast table and—miracle of miracles—took an egg. I may have drily remarked as much, and his keen eyes feathered at their edges in that manner he had which meant that if only Sherlock Holmes had ever learnt to apologize, he might have done so.</p>
			<p class="bt">Instead he coughed and snatched up the nearest paper.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You look a trifle unwell, my dear Watson,” said he, nose-deep in the agony columns. “Never fear, I shall find us some occupation. You only want a little exercise—men of your sort can’t abide kenneling. Just pass the salt, there’s a good fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes was not always right, though he would like to have been. But he was right on that occasion.</p>
			<p class="bt">Before my departure in May or thereabouts, I’ve resolved that I shall pay a call to Baker Street and to Mrs. Hudson. I must see both again, ere I go. For the final time, I’ll look at the dining table, the lone cigar I know absolutely must still reside in the coal scuttle, the pair of armchairs before the fire. There is a botanical reference volume I left behind there in which I used to press occasional flowers during my engagement to Mary, all of them plucked by her during walks through London’s parks and byways and placed in my buttonhole; these dried artifacts I will gather, and lay at her gravestone.</p>
			<p class="bt">Then, having let my own residence and said my goodbyes to the place, I shall have honored ghosts in every way I could, and leave such places behind me for a new life among strangers.</p>
			<p class="bt">I feel much revived. The city’s harsh air is the sweeter to me now that a change is imminent, and one of which I am certain Sherlock Holmes would heartily approve. This strange business of Ronald Adair’s inexplicable murder piques my interest, for instance, and I may make some small effort at unravelling the matter as a final tribute to the wisest and most singular man of my entire acquaintance. Thereafter I shall quit the safety of dry land and tilt at windmills on the open sea. Come, tempests, come storms, come whatever Fate wills save sad indolence!</p>
			<p class="bt">The time for great alterations is upon me. I can think of no sharper nor more constant reminder of my sorrow than my residence and that of Baker Street, the continual bitter quiet of an empty house.</p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the unpublished manuscript<br class="calibre2"/>“The Adventure of the Abernetty Family”:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3"><span class="charoverride3">Holmes, ever the masterful showman, held the kernel high in the air before the cook, whose healthy South American complexion blanched even as she bared her teeth in defiance.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“It is the deadliest substance in all the Amazon,” my friend declaimed, eyes riveted to the small brown shell as if it were a costly jewel. “Related to the castor bean, only a thousand times more potent. After careful processing, the native tribes can render it edible. But when raw, it is used as a lethal poison akin to ricin.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Of course!” I gasped. “Dear God, if only I had recognized the symptoms when greatly exacerbated. The fluid in the lungs combined with convulsions—”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Precisely.” Holmes’s implacable gaze swept to the unrepentant face of the poisoner. “You extracted the oils and combined them with fresh butter, rendering the mixture softer than the usual. Today was hot enough for me to observe so, for the parsley had sunk into it, an impossible occurrence in dealing with pure butter. You fed the lethal concoction to every last one of the Abernettys, and following their metabolizing the stuff, they died in agonies. It was a monstrous vengeance.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“I’d do it a hundred times over </span><span class="charoverride9">despite the fact you’ve found me out</span><span class="charoverride3">,” the cook growled in heavily accented English. “A family for a family. Ignatius Abernetty’s for my entire tribe, lost these fifteen years. What could be more fair? I saw to it they lived in fear of devils, but they never noticed the one beneath their noses!”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“There is no loss keen enough to justify your actions,” Holmes said with the sternness he acquires when confronted by unspeakable tragedy.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">Her eyes burned as bright as the sun over the equator. “Yes, there is. You speak out of ignorance and not understanding. Have you ever been stripped of everything you love, Mr. Holmes?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride9">My friend, a shadow crossing his aquiline features, hesitated for longer than I have ever seen him do, as if trapped within the universe of his own morbid visions.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride9">“No, I have not,” he said at last, speaking as if the weight of the world entire rested upon his shoulders.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride9">“If not, can you imagine it?”</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride9">“I think I can, madam,” he answered gravely.</span></p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride9">“If you can’t, then you don’t know what you’d do, to what lengths you’d go,” the cook whispered, “to feel whole again.”</span></p>
			<p class="_-head-space-above">Excerpt from the diary of Dr. John Watson, <br class="calibre2"/>April 5th, 1894:</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">The most strange, the most glorious, the most glad and inconceivable miracle of my life has just happened.</p>
			<p class="bt">I must confess myself quite shaken; my hand leaps in sudden fits and starts across the page as I write this. My balking brain can make no logical sense of what took place, and I find myself often pausing simply to sit at my desk and allow my mind’s eye to erase the wall of this familiar study and instead to show me events as they just unfolded. I find myself watching them as an admirer of a particular play—or a singular performer—would return to the theatre time and again, gladly bearing money in hand to repeat the identical experience.</p>
			<p class="bt">This was no farce, however, for all that a disguise in the form of an elderly bookseller played a part. The dramatic scene in my consulting room, the journey to the empty house, the changes in the wax dummy’s familiar profile—they were real. They must have been. My shoulder aches from when Colonel Moran tried despite the blow to his cranium to wrench himself away from my fierce grasp, and the high shriek of my friend’s summons on the police whistle remains in my ears even still.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend—I can hardly credit it.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes is alive, and what is more, now I am aware of the fact, and for the very gladdest of reasons.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes has returned to Baker Street.</p>
