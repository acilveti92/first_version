Dubi, a senior case officer, operated from a safe house in London. The phone call was a tremendous shock. On the line was the most important and most secret agent of Mossad, whose very existence was known only to a select few. He was known as the Angel (in some reports, he was code-named “Rashash” or “Hot’el”). The Angel uttered a few words, but one of them made Dubi shudder. It was “chemicals.” Dubi immediately called Mossad headquarters in Israel and conveyed the code word. As soon as it reached the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em>, Zvi Zamir, he told his chief of staff, Freddie Eini: “I am going to London.”</p><p id="p1164" class="text-indent">He knew he had no time to lose. The code word “chemicals” carried an ominous message: “Expect an immediate attack on Israel.”</p><p id="p1165" class="text-indent">Israel was expecting an attack by its Arab neighbors since the 1967 Six-Day War, in which it gained large chunks of territory: the Sinai <span class="ref-pnum">Peninsula</span> and the Gaza strip from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank and Jerusalem from Jordan. The IDF was now deployed on the Golan Heights, on the eastern shore of the Suez Canal, and along <a id="pagebreak-rw_223"></a>the Jordan River. The Arab countries were rattling their sabers, promising revenge, but in the war of attrition that had followed the Six-Day battles, <span class="ref-pnum">Israel</span> had the upper hand. All its efforts to trade the newly conquered <span class="ref-pnum">territories</span> for peace had been angrily rejected by the Arab states. In the meantime, Egypt’s fiery President Nasser had died and been replaced by Anwar Sadat, a man lacking charisma, regarded by the Israeli experts as weak, <span class="ref-pnum">irresolute</span>, and unable to lead his people to a new war. After the death of Prime Minister Eshkol, Israel’s leadership had been entrusted to the strong hands of charismatic Golda Meir, a tough and powerful stateswoman, assisted by the world-famous minister of defense Moshe Dayan. Israel’s security, it seemed, couldn’t be in better hands.</p><p id="p1166" class="text-indent">A few weeks before the phone call, in utmost secrecy, King Hussein of Jordan had flown to Israel and warned Golda that the Egyptians and <span class="ref-pnum">Syrians</span> were planning an attack on Israel. Hussein had become Israel’s secret ally and was engaged in intensive negotiations with Golda’s envoys. But, at the time, Golda was not focused on Hussein’s warnings. She was much more interested in the forthcoming elections, and Golda’s Labor Party <span class="ref-pnum">campaigned</span> under the slogan “All Is Quiet on the Suez Canal.”</p><p id="p1167" class="text-indent">Barely eighteen hours before Yom Kippur, it appeared that nothing was quiet on the Suez Canal. Zvi Zamir took the Angel’s warning very seriously. According to the prearranged procedures, triggered by the code word, the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em> was to meet his agent in London, as soon as he got the signal.</p><p id="p1168" class="text-indent">Zamir boarded the first flight to London. On the sixth floor of an <span class="ref-pnum">apartment</span> building in the British capital, not far from the Dorchester Hotel, Mossad kept a discreet safe house. The apartment was bugged, serviced, and secured by Mossad agents. It had been acquired and equipped for only one purpose: meetings with the Angel. As soon as Zvi Zamir arrived, a detachment of ten Mossad agents took positions around the building, to protect their chief in case the signal from Cairo was part of a plot to capture or injure him. The head of the unit was veteran Zvi Malkin, the legendary agent who had helped catch Eichmann in Argentina.</p><p id="p1169" class="text-indent">Zamir, tense and agitated, waited for the Angel all day long. His agent apparently had made a stopover in Rome, on its way from Cairo, and <a id="pagebreak-rw_224"></a>reached London only in the late evening. The two men met at the safe house at eleven <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.</p><p id="p1170" class="text-indent">In the meantime, Yom Kippur—the holiday of prayer, fasting, and atonement—had settled upon Israel. All work had ceased, the television and radio had stopped their broadcasts, no cars moved on the roads. <span class="ref-pnum">Skeleton</span> army units manned the borders of the Jewish state.</p><p id="p1171" class="text-indent">The meeting between Zamir and the Angel lasted two hours. Dubi noted every word.</p><p id="p1172" class="text-indent">It was close to one <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>. when the meeting ended. Dubi invited the Angel into another room, where he paid him his customary fee of $100,000. Zamir, frantic, hurriedly composed an urgent telegram to Israel. But the Mossad agents couldn’t find the embassy encoder to transmit the vital <span class="ref-pnum">message</span>. Finally, Zamir lost his cool and placed a call to Freddie Eini’s home. The calls were not answered and the harried operator told him: “There is no answer, sir. I think today is an important holiday in Israel.”</p><p id="p1173" class="text-indent">“Try again!” Zamir growled. Finally, the ringing woke up his chief of staff and he picked up the phone. He sounded half-asleep. “Take a basin of cold water,” Zamir said to him. “Put your feet in it and pick up pen and paper.” When Freddie did as he was told, Zamir dictated the code phrase: “The company will sign the contract by the end of the day.”</p><p id="p1174" class="text-indent">Then Zamir added: “Now get dressed, go to headquarters, and wake everybody up.”</p><p id="p1175" class="text-indent">Freddie followed Zamir’s orders to the letter. He started calling the <span class="ref-pnum">political</span> and military leaders of Israel. His message to them could be summed up in one sentence: “War will break out today.”</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line69"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara104"><span class="dropcap">S</span>hortly afterward, the telegram that Zamir had written finally arrived in Tel Aviv: “According to the plan, the Egyptians and the Syrians are going to attack in the early evening. They know that today is a holiday and they believe that they can land [on our side of the Suez Canal] <span class="ref-pnum">before</span> dark. The attack would be carried out according to the plan which is known to us. He (the Angel) believes that Sadat cannot delay the <span class="ref-pnum">attack</span> because of his promise to other Arab heads of state, and he wants <a id="pagebreak-rw_225"></a>to keep his commitment to the last detail. The source estimates that in spite of Sadat’s hesitation, the chances that the attack will be carried out are 99.9 percent. They believe they’ll win, that’s why they fear an early disclosure that may cause an outside intervention; this may deter some of the partners who then will reconsider. The Russians will not take part in the operation.”</p><p id="p1177" class="text-indent">The <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em>’s dramatic report was not accepted by everybody at face value. General Eli Zeira, the handsome, confident chief of Aman, was <span class="ref-pnum">convinced</span> that there was no danger of war, in spite of the worrying reports by intelligence sources. He believed that the huge concentrations of Egyptian soldiers and armor on the African shore of the Suez Canal were nothing but a part of a large army maneuver. Zeira also admitted, in a conversation with Zamir, that he had “no explanation” as to why a report by Unit 848 (later renamed Unit 8200, 848 was the listening and monitoring <span class="ref-pnum">installation</span> of the IDF) stated that the families of the Russian military advisers in Syria and Egypt were urgently leaving those countries—a surefire <span class="ref-pnum">indication</span> of imminent war.</p><p id="p1178" class="text-indent">The chief of Aman and most of the defense community leaders were firm believers in “conception”—a theory that Egypt would attack Israel only under two conditions: first, that it would receive from the Soviet Union fighter jets able to face the Israeli fighter aircraft, as well as <span class="ref-pnum">bombers</span> and missiles that would reach Israel’s population centers; and second, that it would assure the participation of the other Arab countries in the onslaught. As long as these two conditions had not been met, the <span class="ref-pnum">conception</span> said, there was no chance that Egypt would attack. Egypt would make threats, would tease and provoke, would carry out mammoth maneuvers—but wouldn’t go to war.</p><p id="p1179" class="text-indent">But the theory had already failed before, in 1967. That year, a large part of the Egyptian Army was in Yemen, where it waged a prolonged war against the royal army. Israel was convinced that Egypt wouldn’t initiate any provocative or aggressive action as long as part of its army was tied up in the Yemenite quagmire. But on May 15, 1967, the elite units of the Egyptian Army suddenly crossed the Sinai and reached the Israeli border <a id="pagebreak-rw_226"></a>while President Nasser expelled the United Nations’ observers and closed the Straits of the Red Sea to Israeli shipping. Israeli experts should have realized the failure of their logic, but in the afterglow of the astonishing victory of the Six-Day War, it was forgotten.</p><p id="p1180" class="text-indent">The “conception” theory hovered over the extraordinary cabinet <span class="ref-pnum">meeting</span> called in the early hours of October 6, 1973. Not only Zeira, but also several cabinet ministers doubted the report about an imminent <span class="ref-pnum">Egyptian-Syrian</span> surprise attack. Twice in the past, in November 1972 and May 1973, the Angel had flashed Israel a warning about a forthcoming attack. True, he had retracted at the last moment, but in May 1973, huge numbers of reserve soldiers had been urgently mobilized, and the operation had cost Israel the staggering sum of $34.5 million.</p><p id="p1181" class="text-indent">At this morning’s cabinet meeting, everybody was conscious of the gravity of the situation. Nevertheless, they only decided on a partial <span class="ref-pnum">mobilization</span> of reservists. The ministers also decided not to launch a preventive strike on the huge Egyptian concentrations of troops along the canal.</p><p id="p1182" class="text-indent">Zamir returned to Israel and stuck to his guns: war is imminent! He quoted the Angel’s warning of a joint offensive by the Egyptian and Syrian armies, shortly before sunset.</p><p id="p1183" class="text-indent">At two <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>., Zeira summoned the military correspondents to his office and stated that there was only a low probability of war breaking out. He was still speaking, when an aide walked into his office and handed him a short note. Zeira read it, and without another word grabbed his beret and hurried out of the room.</p><p id="p1184" class="text-indent">A few moments later, the wail of the air-raid sirens shattered the silence of Yom Kippur. The war had begun.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line70"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara105"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter the war, senior Aman officers angrily accused the Angel of having misled Zamir by mentioning the end of the day as the H-hour for the attack, while the real offensive had started at midday. Only later it was established that the H-hour had been modified at the last moment, in a phone conversation between the presidents of Syria and Egypt. The Angel was already in the air, on his way to London.</p><p id="p1186" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_227"></a>It seems strange that the Aman chiefs were disturbed by the Angel’s mistake, or by his former mistaken warnings. Apparently, Aman’s chiefs regarded the Angel not as an intelligence source but as Mossad’s <span class="ref-pnum">representative</span> in the office of Egypt’s president, who was supposed to report, in full detail, everything that happened there. They ignored the fact that, in spite of his senior position, the Angel was only a spy; he produced <span class="ref-pnum">excellent</span> reports, but did not always know everything, as is the case with any other spy.</p><p id="p1187" class="text-indent">During the Yom Kippur War that broke out that day, the Angel kept supplying Israel with first-rate intelligence. When the Egyptians fired two Scud missiles at IDF troop concentrations, a reassuring report by the Angel calmed the Israelis. The Egyptian Army had no intention of using more missiles during the fighting, he said, and Egypt wouldn’t escalate the war against Israel.</p><p id="p1188" class="text-indent">The Yom Kippur War ended on October 23. In the Golan Heights, the Syrian Army had been routed, and the Israeli cannons were positioned twenty miles from Damascus. In the south, the Egyptians had occupied a strip five miles wide on the Israeli shore of the Suez Canal, but their Third Army was completely surrounded by the Israelis, who had established a bridgehead in Egyptian territory, broken the Egyptian lines, and attained new positions barely sixty-three miles from Cairo.</p><p id="p1189" class="text-indent">Still, Israel could not rejoice with this victory. The war had cost them 2,656 lives, wounded 7,251, and the myth of its superior power had been destroyed.</p><p id="p1190" class="text-indent">Yet negotiations had started between Israelis and Egyptians and accords were signed, first for the ending of hostilities, then for establishing durable peace between the two nations. Syria refused to join the peace process.</p><p id="p1191" class="text-indent">Zvi Zamir completed his tour of duty and was replaced by general Yitzhak (Haka) Hofi.</p><p id="p1192" class="text-indent">Zamir retired amid general praise for his achievements. He was <span class="ref-pnum">acclaimed</span> for being the only one in the intelligence community to have warned of the military preparations of the Syrians and the Egyptians, and for bringing the crucial report about the imminent attack on Israel. If <span class="ref-pnum">Israel</span>’s <a id="pagebreak-rw_228"></a>leaders had been more attentive to his warnings, and ordered an <span class="ref-pnum">immediate</span> preventive strike, it is highly probable that the results would have been far better for Israel. Certain cabinet ministers maintained that Israel refrained from preventive action so that it could not be accused of starting the war. Not only does this seem contrived, it seems a nearsighted decision. For what was more important—that Israel not be “accused” of triggering the war or that it protect itself with all the means at its disposal?</p><p id="p1193" class="text-indent">And yet, the Israeli historian Dr. Uri Bar-Yossef maintains that the <span class="ref-pnum">Angel</span>’s warning saved the Golan Heights. On the morning of October 6, he wrote, tank crews had been urgently mobilized following the Angel’s <span class="ref-pnum">report</span>; these crews reached the Golan in the afternoon and stopped the <span class="ref-pnum">Syrian</span> advance in the Nafah sector.</p><p id="p1194" class="text-indent">At the war’s end, under unprecedented public pressure, Israel’s <span class="ref-pnum">government</span> appointed a board of inquiry, headed by Supreme Court Judge <span class="ref-pnum">Shimon</span> Agranat, to investigate the decision-making process during the Yom Kippur War. The board ordered the immediate discharge of General Eli Zeira (and several other officers, including Chief of Staff David El’azar).</p><p id="p1195" class="text-indent">But who was the Angel? An unending flow of stories, reports, and books—all of them erroneous—about his identity have been published throughout the years. It was obvious that the Angel was somebody very close to Egypt’s governing circles and Egyptian Army’s supreme command; but no one ever pierced the armor of secrecy that protected his real identity. Journalists and analysts called him by several code names and painted a figure blessed with legendary talents. He became the hero of many spy stories and even some bestselling novels.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line71"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara106"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter his discharge, General Zeira carried his frustration deep in his heart. He was determined to prove his innocence and reveal his <span class="ref-pnum">version</span> of the 1973 events to the world.</p><p id="p1197" class="text-indent">He finally decided to write a book, and give his own answer to the <span class="ref-pnum">question</span>: Why did he reject the Angel’s report?</p><p id="p1198" class="text-indent">The general wrote that the Angel was nothing less than a double agent <a id="pagebreak-rw_229"></a>who had been planted in Mossad by the wily Egyptians in order to mislead the Israelis.</p><p id="p1199" class="text-indent">Some reporters bought Zeira’s story, and wrote that the Angel was <span class="ref-pnum">indeed</span> a double agent par excellence. The Angel’s role, they explained, was, over a length of time, to deliver to Israel truthful and accurate intelligence, in order to win its trust—and then, when Mossad was practically eating out of his hand, feed it a monstrous lie that would destroy it.</p><p id="p1200" class="text-indent">It was a great story. It explained everything, almost … Because both Zeira and his followers chose to disregard one single fact: all the Angel’s reports, from the very beginning and till the very end, had been absolutely accurate. So where was the lie?</p><p id="p1201" class="text-indent">And when the Angel could mislead Israel and inform it that the massing of troops on the Suez Canal’s shore was just a maneuver, and there was no danger of war—the “double agent” chose the opposite solution: he called Zamir’s aide in England and sent him the warning—“chemicals”—then flew to London and warned Zamir that the surprise attack was imminent.</p><p id="p1202" class="text-indent">But Zeira could not be stopped. In 2004, when a new edition of his book was published, he went a step further and revealed the Angel’s <span class="ref-pnum">identity</span> to the public. In a series of interviews, culminating with a television news show hosted by veteran journalist Dan Margalit, Zeira used the <span class="ref-pnum">Angel</span>’s real name.</p><p id="p1203" class="text-indent">Ashraf Marwan.</p><p id="p1204" class="text-indent">The name stunned all those familiar with the Egyptian political circles. They could not believe that Marwan might be an Israeli spy.</p><p id="p1205" class="text-indent">But who was this master spy? Who was Ashraf Marwan?</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line72"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara107"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n 1965, a sweet, shy Egyptian girl met a charming and handsome young man at the Heliopolis tennis court. The girl, Moona, was the third daughter in her family and not exactly the smartest. Her sister Huda was more gifted and an A-student at the Giza high school. But Moona was cute, charming, and her father’s favorite child. The young man she had met came from a respectable and well-off family; he had just graduated <a id="pagebreak-rw_230"></a>with a B.S. in chemistry and had joined the army. And Moona fell for him, head over heels.</p><p id="p1207" class="text-indent">Shortly afterward, she introduced her boyfriend to her family. That’s how the young man met Moona’s father, Egypt’s president Gamal Abdel Nasser.</p><p id="p1208" class="text-indent">Nasser was not sure that his daughter had met the ideal match, but she did not leave him any choice. Finally, Nasser invited the young man’s <span class="ref-pnum">father</span>, a senior officer in the President’s Guard, to his office, and the two men agreed that their children should get married. A year later, in July 1966, the young people were wed. Soon after, Moona’s young husband was posted at the chemical department of the Republic Guards, and at the end of 1968 was transferred to the presidential department of science.</p><p id="p1209" class="text-indent">The name of the president’s son-in-law was Ashraf Marwan.</p><p id="p1210" class="text-indent">The young man apparently was not satisfied with his new job. He asked Nasser for permission to pursue his studies in London. Nasser agreed, and Ashraf Marwan, alone, settled in England’s capital, under the close <span class="ref-pnum">supervision</span> of the Egyptian embassy.</p><p id="p1211" class="text-indent">But the supervision, apparently, was not close enough. Ashraf Marwan loved the good life, the parties, the adventures—and London of the sixties generously supplied all of that. It didn’t take long for the young Egyptian to spend all his allowance. He needed another source of financing for his nightly entertainments—and soon he found it.</p><p id="p1212" class="text-indent">Her name was Suad, and she was married to the Kuwaiti sheik Abdallah Mubarak Al-Sabah. Ashraf charmed her and she opened her purse in <span class="ref-pnum">return</span>. But the arrangement did not last long. The affair was exposed and an angry Nasser had his son-in-law sent home in disgrace. Nasser demanded that Moona divorce the adulterer, but she flatly refused. Nasser finally <span class="ref-pnum">decided</span> that Marwan would remain in Egypt and be allowed to go to <span class="ref-pnum">London</span> only to deliver his papers to his professors; Marwan also had to pay back all the money he had received from Suad Al-Sabah. He got a job in Nasser’s office, and once in a while he would be charged with petty tasks or missions.</p><p id="p1213" class="text-indent">In 1969, Ashraf Marwan came to London again, to submit an essay to <a id="pagebreak-rw_231"></a>the university. But on that occasion, he also took the first step to betraying his father-in-law. His humiliation by Egypt’s president had left him <span class="ref-pnum">bitter</span> and frustrated. He did not hesitate: he phoned the Israeli embassy and asked to speak to the military attaché. When an officer answered, Marwan identified himself by his real name, and bluntly said that he wanted to work for Israel. He asked that his offer be forwarded to the people dealing with this kind of activity. The officer who received his call did not take him seriously and did not report the call; Marwan’s second call also remained unanswered. But the story reached some Mossad officials. The chief of Mossad’s European section, Shmuel Goren, received a phone call from Marwan. Goren knew who Marwan was, was aware of the man’s important position, and asked Marwan not to call the embassy anymore; he gave him an unlisted number and immediately alerted some of his colleagues.</p><p id="p1214" class="text-indent">Goren’s top-secret report was handed to Zvi Zamir and to Rehavia Vardi, the head of Tzomet, the Mossad department for agent recruitment. The two of them appointed a special team to check Marwan’s offer in-depth. On the one hand, Marwan’s move had all the characteristics of a classic sting operation: somebody high up in an enemy organization volunteers as an agent, and no effort is needed to recruit him. That seems very suspicious. The man can be a double agent, sent over as bait by the Egyptian services.</p><p id="p1215" class="text-indent">But on the other hand—the same equation might have the opposite meaning. Somebody high up in the enemy organization volunteers as an agent. He certainly must have access to ultrasecret material that nobody else can provide. Perhaps, after all, he was the ideal agent, the one every secret service in the world dreamed about? Besides, Vardi’s men knew who Marwan was—an ambitious young man, a hedonist, therefore somebody who loved money. The temptation for Mossad recruiters was great.</p><p id="p1216" class="text-indent">Goren returned to London and asked to meet Marwan. Marwan agreed and arrived elegantly dressed, ever the handsome young man. He openly told Goren that he had been deeply disappointed by Egypt’s defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War, and had decided to join the winner. But beside that “ideological” motive, Marwan asked for lots of money: $100,000 for every meeting in which he would deliver a report to his handlers.</p><p id="p1217" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_232"></a>Goren was inclined to accept the offer, in spite of the huge cost. Such sums had never before been paid to a Mossad agent. But first, Goren needed tangible proof that Marwan was as good as his word. He asked him for a sample of the secret documents he could deliver. The delivery of the <span class="ref-pnum">documents</span> would also tie Marwan to Mossad. It was self-incriminating, solid proof that Marwan had become an Israeli agent. From the Egyptian point of view, that would make him a traitor and an enemy agent.</p><p id="p1218" class="text-indent">Marwan did not let Goren wait long, and brought the full minutes of the talks held by President Nasser with the leaders of the Soviet Union in Moscow, on January 22, 1970. In that visit, Nasser demanded that the <span class="ref-pnum">Soviets</span> supply him with modern, long-range jet bombers that could carry out bombings deep inside Israel.</p><p id="p1219" class="text-indent">The document astonished all those who read it. They had never seen such a paper; its authenticity was beyond doubt. Now Mossad chiefs <span class="ref-pnum">realized</span> that they had a fabulous treasure in their hands. They appointed Dubi as Marwan’s handler and sent him to London. They also took immediate care of all the arrangements: renting an apartment in London for the <span class="ref-pnum">meetings</span> with the Angel, equipping it with hidden listening and recording <span class="ref-pnum">devices</span>, securing it, establishing a special fund for the financing of their star agent. The games could start.</p><p id="p1220" class="text-indent">The meetings were initiated by Marwan himself, whenever he had something to report. According to the rules established with Dubi, <span class="ref-pnum">Marwan</span> would make a phone call to a middleman (some sources claim that he used to call Jewish women in London), and Mossad would be alerted. Marwan provided his handlers with lots of intelligence and top-secret <span class="ref-pnum">political</span> and military documents. Colonel Meir Meir, the head of Branch 6 (Egyptian Army) in Aman, participated in several of those meetings. Meir used to fly to London under an assumed identity; all identifying labels would have been removed from his clothes. He used to move around <span class="ref-pnum">London</span> for hours, by foot, in cabs and buses, to make absolutely sure he was not followed, then, finally, reach the apartment building and go up to the sixth floor. When he came to the apartment the first time, he met there a handsome but unpleasant man, who openly disdained him and <span class="ref-pnum">condescendingly </span> <a id="pagebreak-rw_233"></a> glowered at him. Marwan softened up only when he realized that Meir was a man of vast knowledge and experience. Once, Meir was asked by his Mossad friend to bring a briefcase to Marwan. When he asked what was in the case, his friend winked at him and said “a penthouse in Hamedina Square” (the most exclusive neighborhood in Tel Aviv), hinting that it carried a fabulous sum of money. According to Mossad estimates, Marwan’s reports during his secret service for Israel cost the Jewish state more than $3 million.</p><p id="p1221" class="text-indent">Nasser died on September 28, 1970, and was replaced by Anwar Sadat. Professor Shimon Shamir, one of the foremost Egypt scholars in Israel, analyzed Sadat’s character for Mossad. A feeble, dull man, Shamir said; he stressed that Sadat would not stay long in power or go to war. Many of Egypt’s leaders thought the same, but Marwan decided to back Sadat unconditionally. He took the keys to Nasser’s personal safe from his wife, collected the most important files and documents, and brought them to the new president.</p><p id="p1222" class="text-indent">He stood by him again in May 1971, when some of Egypt’s leaders <span class="ref-pnum">conspired</span> to carry out a pro-Soviet coup. Some of the most famous names in Egypt were among the conspirers: Ali Sabri, a former vice president; Mahmoud Fawzi, a former minister of war; Sharawi Guma, minister of the interior, and other ministers and members of parliament. The plan was to assassinate Sadat during his visit to Alexandria University. But Sadat moved first, and arrested all the conspirators. Marwan stood by him, and assisted Sadat when he smashed the conspiracy.</p><p id="p1223" class="text-indent">The results were not long coming. Marwan’s position in the Egyptian <span class="ref-pnum">hierarchy</span> vastly improved. He was appointed presidential secretary for <span class="ref-pnum">information</span> and special adviser to the president. He accompanied Sadat on his trips throughout the Arab world and took part in top-level political talks.</p><p id="p1224" class="text-indent">As Marwan’s status improved, so did his reports. In 1971, Sadat traveled to Moscow several times, and presented Leonid Brezhnev with a shopping list of the weapons he needed to attack Israel. The list included, among other things, MiG-25 aircraft. Marwan delivered the list to his Mossad <span class="ref-pnum">handlers</span>; when they asked for the minutes of the Sadat-Brezhnev talks, <span class="ref-pnum">Marwan </span><a id="pagebreak-rw_234"></a>brought that, too. Zvi Zamir was profoundly impressed by Marwan’s reports, and met him in person. The material provided by Marwan was distributed to a few senior Mossad and Aman officers, the IDF chief of staff and his deputy, Prime Minister Golda Meir, Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan, and Golda’s confidant, minister without portfolio Israel Galili.</p><p id="p1225" class="text-indent">Some of Marwan’s material apparently landed on the desks of other secret services. He approached the Italian secret service and offered to work for it as well; according to one source, he also established contact with the British MI6. That explains why, on that fateful October 5, when he was on his way to meet with Zvi Zamir in London, he made a stopover in Rome: he informed the Italians, too, about the forthcoming war.</p><p id="p1226" class="text-indent">Another one of his reports had reached the Italians before, but this was by means of Mossad. A month before the Yom Kippur War, Libya had asked for Egypt’s help. Palestinian terrorists, in the service of Libya’s leader, Muammar Khaddafi, intended to shoot down an El Al plane during its takeoff from Rome’s airport.</p><p id="p1227" class="text-indent">This was meant to be an act of vengeance against Israel for mistakenly shooting down a civilian Libyan aircraft over Sinai in February 1973. Mossad had obtained evidence that Palestinian terrorists were planning to hijack a plane, load it with explosives, and crash the plane in one of Israel’s big cities (see chapter 12). When a plane flying the Libyan colors emerged over Sinai, refusing to identify itself and to leave the Israeli-controlled space, the Israeli Air Force controllers concluded that this was the suicide bombers’ aircraft. They launched a couple of fighter jets that shot the plane down. It was later established that the airliner had strayed from its course because of a sand storm that raged over Sinai. The Israeli medics found 108 bodies among the aircraft’s smoldering debris.</p><p id="p1228" class="text-indent">Khaddafi swore to avenge the victims. The team to carry out the <span class="ref-pnum">operation</span> numbered five Fatah terrorists, led by Amin Al-Hindi. President Sadat decided to help the Libyans and ordered Marwan to deliver two Russian-made Strela missiles to the terrorists. Marwan sent the <span class="ref-pnum">surface-to-air</span> missiles to Rome via the diplomatic pouch. In Rome, Marwan loaded the missiles into his car; met with Al-Hindi in a shoe store on the <span class="ref-pnum">world-famous </span><a id="pagebreak-rw_235"></a>Via Veneto; entered a carpet store with him, and bought two large carpets. Together they wrapped the missiles in the carpets and transported them, by subway, to the Palestinians’ safe house … The terrorists prepared to launch the missiles, unaware that Marwan had already alerted Mossad, and Mossad warned the Italians. On September 6, the antiterror squad of the Italian police broke into an apartment in Ostia, close to the Rome <span class="ref-pnum">airport</span>. The Italians arrested some of the terrorist team members and seized the missiles. The other members of the team were apprehended in a Rome hotel. The Italian press named Mossad as the source that had alerted the Italian services; some maintained that during the operation, Zvi Zamir himself was present in Rome.</p><p id="p1229" class="text-indent">A month later, the Yom Kippur War broke out.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line73"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara108"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter the war, Marwan kept fulfilling major secret tasks for Sadat. He was sent as Sadat’s envoy to Arab capitals, and was active in the <span class="ref-pnum">separation</span> of forces between Syria and Egypt—and Israel. He was also <span class="ref-pnum">present</span> at the talks between U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger and King Hussein of Jordan in Amman. The separation of forces gave Marwan the opportunity to connect with another secret service—the American CIA, which was looking for credible intelligence about Egypt’s policy after the interim agreements with Israel. According to American sources, the secret relations between Marwan and the CIA lasted almost twenty-five years. He visited the United States several times for medical treatment and <span class="ref-pnum">enjoyed</span> a warm welcome and generous hospitality, courtesy of the CIA.</p><p id="p1231" class="text-indent">But even his senior position and secret activities lost their appeal, and Marwan started a second career, in business. He bought a luxurious <span class="ref-pnum">apartment</span> in London, at 24 Carlton House Terrace, and started investing his money in various projects. In 1975, Ashraf Marwan was appointed <span class="ref-pnum">chairman</span> of the Arab Industrial Union—an organization founded by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf Emirates in order to produce conventional weapons by Western methods. The project failed, but it helped Marwan to establish valuable contacts in the business world. After a short term, he was removed from his position, and in 1979 he moved to Paris. Two years later, <a id="pagebreak-rw_236"></a>after the assassination of President Sadat by fanatic terrorists, he moved to London and started a brilliant business career, which made him a very rich man. He hosted his Mossad handler Dubi in a hotel he owned in Majorca, in the Balearic Islands, and let him know that he was retiring from the world of espionage. Some claim that by the end of the seventies Marwan felt the Egyptian soil burning under his feet, and that he was suspected of maintaining secret ties with Israel, so he decided to leave both Egypt and Mossad for good.</p><p id="p1232" class="text-indent">In the following years, Marwan made a series of fabulous business deals. He invested his money well, and soon bought a part of the Chelsea <span class="ref-pnum">Football</span> Club, while competing with Mohamed Al-Fayed, the father of Princess Diana’s boyfriend Dodi, for the purchase of the upscale Harrods <span class="ref-pnum">department</span> store in London. He stuck to his hedonistic lifestyle, was always well dressed, and a string of love affairs trailed in his wake. Some CIA agents, who came to see him once in his New York hotel, had to wait outside until his current paramour dressed and cleared out of his suite.</p><p id="p1233" class="text-indent">In the eighties, Marwan’s name was linked to several arms-running deals for Khaddafi’s regime in Libya and the terrorists in Lebanon. An American journalist reported that he invited a CIA agent to his home, led him to the terrace, and pointed to a shiny Rolls-Royce parked outside. “This is a present from Khaddafi,” he said.</p><p id="p1234" class="text-indent">The story about Marwan’s terrorist connection seems to be pure <span class="ref-pnum">fabrication</span>. Marwan wouldn’t have dealt with terrorists and risked a <span class="ref-pnum">confrontation</span> with Mossad that could expose his past as an Israeli agent, sentencing him to certain death. If Marwan had delved into shady deals with Libya or the terrorists, it could have been only in full cooperation with Mossad.</p><p id="p1235" class="text-indent">But years passed by, and in 2002, a book titled <em class="calibre7">A History of Israel</em> came out in London. The book was written by the Israeli scholar Ahron <span class="ref-pnum">Bregman</span>, and mentioned the spy who had warned Israel of the forthcoming Yom Kippur War. Bregman called the spy “the son-in-law.” This was a hint that the spy was close to an important personality; and the Angel was <span class="ref-pnum">Nasser</span>’s son-in-law. Bregman wrote that the man had been a double agent, who provided Israel with false information.</p><p id="p1236" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_237"></a>The book did not reveal Marwan’s name, but it did rouse his anger. He reacted in an interview in the Egyptian <em class="calibre7">Al-Ahram</em> newspaper, in which he mocked Bregman’s research and called it “a stupid detective story.”</p><p id="p1237" class="text-indent">Bregman, offended, decided to defend his honor, and in an interview with <em class="calibre7">Al-Ahram</em> openly stated that “the son-in-law” was indeed Ashraf Marwan. This was a grave accusation, but it lacked any proof. It did not have any impact—till the day when Eli Zeira declared that the double agent who “fooled” Israel was, indeed, Ashraf <span class="ref-pnum">Marwan</span>.</p><p id="p1238" class="text-indent">Such a thing had never happened in Israel before. The identity of former spies was not revealed, in many cases, even after their death. And Ashraf Marwan was alive, vulnerable, an easy prey for the killers of the Egyptian Mukhabarat. Zvi Zamir came back from thirty years of retirement and tried to establish contact with Marwan, but the Angel refused to speak with him. “He didn’t want to,” Zamir dolefully said, “because he felt I didn’t protect him. I did all I could to protect him, but I did not succeed.”</p><p id="p1239" class="text-indent">Following Zeira’s revelations, Zamir broke his self-imposed silence and harshly attacked the former Aman chief. He accused him of revealing state secrets. Zeira hit back, claiming that the former <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em> was protecting a man who was nothing but a double agent.</p><p id="p1240" class="text-indent">Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, who watched a live television <span class="ref-pnum">broadcast</span> of an official ceremony in Egypt, saw President Hosni Mubarak warmly shaking the hand of Marwan, who accompanied him in laying a wreath on Nasser’s tomb. After the broadcast, Bergman wrote that Marwan had been a double agent. As for President Mubarak, he flew to Marwan’s aid and firmly rejected the rumors of his being an Israeli spy.</p><p id="p455" class="text-indent">Israel was engulfed in a flood of accusations and counteraccusations. Mossad and Aman established two boards of inquiry that reached the same conclusion: Marwan was not a double agent and did not cause any harm to Israel. Zeira did not give up and sued Zamir in a court of law. The <span class="ref-pnum">former</span> justice Theodore Or, who had been appointed arbitrator by the court, firmly ruled that Zamir’s version was the true one.</p><p id="p1241" class="text-indent">Zeira and his supporters apparently chose to ignore the fact that <span class="ref-pnum">Marwan</span> had been one of the leading figures of the Egyptian government, the <a id="pagebreak-rw_238"></a>son-in-law of Nasser and close adviser of Sadat. The leaders of Egypt did not want to admit that one of their own had been a traitor and a Zionist spy. Such an admission would have shocked the Egyptian public opinion and shaken the Egyptians’ trust in their leaders. So they chose a different approach: to laud and praise Marwan in public, but seal his fate in secret.</p><p id="p1242" class="text-indent">In early June 2007, Justice Or published his findings. On June 12, an Israeli court officially confirmed Zamir’s account on Marwan’s role in the service of Mossad. Two weeks later, on June 27, Marwan’s body was found on a sidewalk, under his terrace.</p><p id="p1243" class="text-indent">Israeli observers accused the Egyptian secret service of the murder. Many accused Zeira, claiming that by his reckless behavior he had caused Marwan’s death. On the other hand, in a hardly surprising statement, <span class="ref-pnum">Marwan</span>’s widow accused Mossad of murdering her husband. Eyewitnesses said that they had seen men with Middle Eastern features standing with <span class="ref-pnum">Marwan</span> on his terrace, minutes before his death.</p><p id="p1244" class="text-indent">The Scotland Yard closed and reopened the case, and finally stated that it was unable to find the perpetrators. The Angel’s murderers still remain free.</p></div>
