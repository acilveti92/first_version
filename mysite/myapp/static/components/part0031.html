<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter024" class="calibre4">TWENTY-FOUR</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">I lowered my head and pressed forward into the falling snow as I made my way along the Right Bank. Above me the sky sagged with layers of grey cloud like wet wool; the snow had begun to settle already, smoothing over the ruts in the frozen mud underfoot. I was glad of Gabrielle’s cloak, though it was a strange sensation to pull the fur hood close around my face and catch the scent of her perfume, oddly familiar. Once or twice instinct caused my skin to prickle and I ducked into the shelter of buildings, convinced that someone was following me, but the snow had muffled all sounds and reduced my vision to a few yards in either direction. If anyone was tailing me, they must have watched me come from the palace. I quickened my steps. The Duke of Guise would be looking for me, of that I was certain; he would surely have learned by now that I had robbed him twice over, of his horse and the Comte de Saint-Fermin, not to mention the business of breaking open his sister’s private escritoire, and he might well feel it was time for a reckoning. I did not want to find myself intercepted by him before I had had the chance to speak to Jacopo.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned into the rue des Tournelles, keeping close to the shadows where I could, and saw that there were now two armed guards outside Jacopo’s gate. I stated my business and one of them held me at bay while the other knocked at the door and exchanged a few words with the steward, who beckoned me in with a marked lack of enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Brought any more dying men for my master to tend at his own expense?’ he asked, peering past me into the night.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not today.’ I ignored his tone and shook the snow off my boots. ‘How is the patient?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sleeping, mainly. He took a little broth this afternoon. One of the maids is sitting with him.’ His manner softened a fraction. ‘It would make a stone weep, to see a man reduced to that state. Signor Corbinelli is not yet back from the palace. With this weather it may be that he decides to stay. Do you want to wait?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘For a while. If I may.’</p>
<p class="indented">He showed me into Jacopo’s study and offered to bring me some warm bread and fresh candles. The fire had burned low but I threw on another log and huddled on a chair by the hearth. When the food had been brought and the steward had closed the door behind him, I took off Gabrielle’s cloak and paced the room, trying to gather my thoughts. As I passed Jacopo’s desk, my eyes fell on the heavy volume he had left open there. This was the book he had been in such a hurry to clear away when I arrived the night before. Curious, I pulled it towards me and found that it was a copy of the <em class="calibre6">Summa Theologica</em> by Thomas Aquinas, with sheets of paper poking from it at intervals. I turned to the pages Jacopo had marked with his notes and felt my throat dry as I began to see the import of what I read.</p>
<p class="indented">He had been underlining passages in the <em class="calibre6">Supplementum Tertiae Partis</em> where Aquinas addresses questions concerning matrimony and the legitimacy of children. I picked up one of the sheets of notes in Jacopo’s handwriting.</p>
<p class="indented"><em class="calibre6">Aquinas clearly states that a child conceived and/or born out of legal marriage can be legitimised in one of six ways, the first two according to the canons if the man marries the mother of the child, and by special dispensation and indulgence of the Lord Pope,</em> <span class="underline-italic">providing the child was not conceived in adultery</span>, he had written. Below he had noted: <em class="calibre6">He may also be legitimised if the father designate him legitimate in a public document signed by three witnesses, if there be no legitimate son.</em></p>
<p class="indented">There were further notes and jottings, half-formed sentences peppered with question marks, but the gist seemed clear enough.</p>
<p class="indented">I sat down at the desk, hands pressed to my temples, my thoughts racing. More than once I considered leaving and taking my chances in the streets, but I realised I had nowhere else to go. There was no one in Paris save Jacopo that I could talk to about any of this, except perhaps the King and he was in no state to discuss anything. Perhaps I could rely on the old scholar to deal frankly with me, though I was less certain of that than I had been when I arrived.</p>
<p class="indented">An hour passed before I heard the front door and the muffled exchange of voices in the hall. I arranged myself calmly behind the desk so that I had a clear view of Jacopo as he entered the study, brushing snow from his coat and rubbing his hands.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Bruno! How good to see you – what about this weather! Are you warm enough? I shall send for more logs – the snow looks as if it means to stay.’ He stopped when he saw my face. ‘What is it? Has something happened?’</p>
<p class="indented">I tapped the book with a forefinger. ‘You have been studying Aquinas.’</p>
<p class="indented">He looked down at the papers and back to meet my eye. ‘There is always fresh wisdom to be found in the writings of the good Doctor,’ he said carefully.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why – are you expecting a child out of wedlock? My congratulations.’ My voice was flinty.</p>
<p class="indented">His brow creased; he tilted his head and looked at me a little sadly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Bruno, you are always welcome as a guest in my house, you know that. But as a courtesy – my private papers …’ He gestured to the desk. ‘I would not go through your notebooks in your absence.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You could, if you wished. You would not find any evidence that I had connived at <em class="calibre6">murder</em>.’ I half rose from the chair as I spoke; I saw a flash of anger in his face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Think what you are saying, Bruno, before your words do too much damage. Do you not know me better than that?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Tell me I am wrong, then. This is about Léonie de Châtillon, isn’t it?’ I jabbed at the book again. ‘You knew what Catherine was planning all along.’</p>
<p class="indented">He drew breath to speak, just as there was a knock at the door and the steward entered with a tray bearing a jug of hot wine and two glasses. He squinted from one to the other of us with mild interest, noting the tension in the room, before backing away quietly and closing the door. Jacopo lifted his head, listening for the man’s retreating footsteps before he spoke.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Catherine asked me to find any legal and theological precedents for legitimising a child conceived outside marriage,’ he said in a low voice. He poured two drinks and stood by the fire, hands wrapped around his glass, watching the flames. ‘This was around a month ago. She did not explain her reasons. I presumed it was connected to her ongoing schemes for Henri, but I did not question her.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have underlined this sentence about adultery,’ I said, pointing to the sheet of notes. I sat back in the chair. ‘Don’t tell me you didn’t know she was asking about his mistress. The dolphin medallion – you realised then, didn’t you?’</p>
<p class="indented">He sighed, passing a hand over his bald patch. ‘I understood better, yes. I took it to Catherine and said it was on the ground where the girl’s body was found. She confessed then that Léonie had believed herself to be carrying Henri’s child. Catherine gave her the medallion as a promise that her child would one day be Dauphin, if she did as she was told.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you ask Catherine what she planned to do about Queen Louise?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She said she had intended to have the King’s marriage annulled in time to legitimise the child by a new marriage before it was born. But it was all moot by then. The girl was dead.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Catherine wasn’t looking for an annulment. Not when there was a quicker way to be rid of the Queen. You must have guessed at that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your imagination is running wild now, Bruno.’ There was a warning note in his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘On the contrary – I have never understood the matter so clearly. Everything is connected. When Catherine found out that Léonie was pregnant after she had become Henri’s mistress, she had to accelerate her plans. There was no time for legal procedures. Did you not see how ill Queen Louise was on the night of the ball? One of them was poisoning her, little by little – Léonie, perhaps, or Ruggieri. Louise was convinced of it. But Léonie was eaten up by guilt over this plan she had become entangled in – she confessed to Père Lefèvre, who was moved by his conscience to warn the Queen in an anonymous letter. But I think someone at the palace read that letter. Paul had to be silenced and so did Léonie.’ I pushed the chair back and joined him by the fire. ‘No wonder you kept telling me to leave it alone.’ I could not hide the resentment in my voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I had no idea the priest was anything to do with this business, Bruno, you must believe me. I only thought it wiser for you not to be involved, especially if Guise was behind it. But when Léonie died and you seemed determined to prove that all the deaths were connected, I knew you were going to march straight into trouble.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Because you knew the killer was inside the palace, you mean?’</p>
<p class="indented">He hesitated, weighing his words, not meeting my eye.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know nothing about the other two, the priest and the friar. I give you my word. When Léonie was found and you showed me that medallion, I confess I had misgivings. It seemed easier to believe she had taken her own life.’ His voice had grown quiet. He drained his glass and turned away.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You had misgivings,’ I repeated flatly. ‘But there was a further twist to the story, you see – Léonie’s child was very likely not even Henri’s. She was still sleeping with the Duke of Guise.’</p>
<p class="indented">He raised his head and stared at me. ‘<em class="calibre6">Gesù Cristo.</em> Do you think Catherine found out?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Someone found out,’ I said. ‘Queen Louise took the priest’s warning seriously. She also guessed that Léonie was pregnant. She had one of her servants follow her to see if she met other men. I think she knew about Léonie and Guise.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you think she told Catherine?’ He frowned. ‘But that would have meant admitting she believed Catherine was plotting against her.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think she found her own solution.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo rubbed a hand slowly over his beard and stared at me. ‘What are you saying, Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I found a scarf with Queen Louise’s device embroidered on it in the woods where Léonie was killed,’ I said. ‘I believe it was the one used to strangle her.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You think Queen Louise murdered Léonie? Have you gone quite mad?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It fits. Louise knew her life was in danger from this woman who planned to take her place, marry the King and give him a supposed Dauphin that was most likely a Guise bastard.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s impossible,’ Jacopo said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But she had every reason to want the girl dead,’ I persisted. ‘She may not have been as ill as she looked that night.’</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head. ‘I’m afraid she was worse than she looked. She sat bravely through the masque, but she was overcome by a terrible fit of vomiting immediately after and had to be carried to a guest room. I accompanied her, along with two of her ladies. She was given a draught to settle her stomach and help her sleep and the women remained there with her, along with a nursemaid, for the rest of the night. She certainly wasn’t dashing through the grounds strangling anyone, that much is beyond question. Though I do not deny her symptoms could be consistent with poisoning,’ he added, as if this might make me feel better.</p>
<p class="indented">I fell heavily into a chair, pressing my fingers to my eyes. ‘You’re right. It was an absurd idea. I couldn’t make it fit with my theory that the same person killed both Léonie and Joseph de Chartres. But, Jacopo, I am still convinced the killer is inside the palace.’</p>
<p class="indented">He laid a hand on my shoulder. ‘Then do you not think it is time for you to follow my advice and walk away? If Catherine is the author of it, what can you do?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I could tell the King,’ I said, defiant. ‘He is the highest authority in France, not her, and he wants the killer found.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo laughed softly. ‘Think what you are saying. You saw for yourself the state he worked himself into over the girl’s death. As far as I know, he had no idea about the child. How do you think he will react when he learns your theory that she was pregnant with a child that may or may not have been his, and that his mother intended first to kill his lawful wife and then ordered the death of his mistress? Do you think that will spur him to a speedy recovery, the quicker to take up the reins of government again? Or do you want to make him worse, hm?’ He searched my eyes, his mouth compressed into a grave line, until I was forced to look away.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think he would want to be told if his mother was practising against him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you really?’ He let his arm fall to his side and crossed the room to pour another drink. ‘You know Henri by now, Bruno. He is a weak man, governed by lust and fear in equal measure. He could not survive without Catherine, and he knows it. He may rail against her, but in the end he will accept her rule, whatever it involves. If you try to set him against her you will only succeed in losing everyone’s favour, and you cannot afford that. Ask yourself – can you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But he set me to find a murderer,’ I insisted, hearing myself sound like a petulant child.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you almost did. You uncovered a conspiracy that, unfortunately, you can do nothing about. Now let it go. Your friends have suffered enough for your meddling already.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What do you mean? Are you in trouble?’ His tone sent a prickle of anxiety up my spine; I thought of Cotin, sentenced to solitary confinement because of me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m talking about the <em class="calibre6">Gelosi</em>,’ he said, grimly, sitting down at his desk and closing the Aquinas book with a decisive thud. ‘I have only just heard that they are being held at the Hotel de Montpensier because apparently one of their number is accused of theft and spying. They managed to slip a message out with a servant. They are supposed to leave for Lyon tomorrow, but the Duchess refuses to release them until this man returns and hands himself in with the stolen goods.’ He gave me a meaningful look from beneath lowered brows.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre6">Merda</em>.’ I pinched the bridge of my nose between my thumb and forefinger. ‘I didn’t think she would imprison them. I should go there now.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo shook his head. ‘That would be extremely unwise. I am about to write to Catherine asking her to intervene with the Duke of Montpensier, but there is not much I can do without her approval. It will require a show of force, I suspect. Our friends will be all right – I don’t suppose the Duchess would dare to harm them. But this would not have occurred if you had listened to me sooner, Bruno.’ He spoke gently but firmly, a father to a wayward boy. I nodded. A wave of tiredness crashed over me and I buried my face in my hands again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why don’t you stay here tonight?’ Jacopo said, picking up his quill. ‘You don’t want to go out in that again. Get some rest and you can find your way home in the morning.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stood, watching him sharpen his nib for a moment before my eyes focused clearly on what he was doing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘May I see your penknife?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">He glanced up, surprised, but held it out to me. I reached inside my doublet and took out the one I had been carrying around since my visit to the silversmith’s that morning. They were almost identical.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where did you get this?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘A gift from Catherine, years ago now. They were made by a master silversmith under her patronage back in Florence, I believe. The work is quite distinctive. She has given them to some in her service as a mark of favour. They are worth a bit by now. Where did you find that one?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘By Joseph de Chartres’s body.’</p>
<p class="indented">He eyed the knives as I handed his back. ‘I mean it, Bruno. Let it go. For everyone’s sake. And any time you wish to apologise for accusing me of conniving at murder, I will be glad to accept it,’ he added, with an edge to his voice, returning his attention to the paper before him.</p>
<p class="indented">I lowered my eyes. ‘Forgive me, Jacopo. I spoke in haste.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">He nodded, mollified, and the conversation appeared to be at an end. But you <em class="calibre6">are</em> conniving at murder, I thought, tucking the penknife away in my pocket. And so am I, if I agree to leave this business unfinished.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">I took a bed in one of the guest rooms as Jacopo had suggested, but I could not sleep. Thoughts of Queen Louise, Paul, Léonie and the <em class="calibre6">Gelosi </em>tumbled through my mind as I lay there in my clothes, staring at the ceiling while my candle burned lower and listening to the sounds of the household preparing to turn in for the night, until silence settled over the house. From a nearby street I heard church bells tolling twelve. I rose as quietly as possible, pulled Gabrielle’s cloak around my shoulders and tiptoed to the door. When I was certain no one was stirring, I crept downstairs and found my boots in the hallway. I could not let Francesco and Isabella and their friends remain incarcerated and lose their livelihood because of my recklessness when it was me that Guise wanted. Privately I thought Jacopo over-optimistic in his assertion that the Duchess of Montpensier would not harm them; the rule of law had deteriorated so far in Paris that the Guises seemed to believe they were no longer subject to it. I doubted Catherine would make the players a priority while she was preoccupied with the King’s health, but Jacopo was right that it would be folly to hand myself over to Guise or his sister alone. That left me with only one possible avenue. I would have to ask Paget for help.</p>
<p class="indented">The prospect of it stuck in my throat. I had no idea if he would consider it in his interest to do me another favour and I was all the more reluctant to ask now that I knew the truth about his relationship with Stafford, but it seemed he was close to the Duchess of Montpensier and he was my best hope of reasoning with her. I took a lantern, unbolted the front door and slipped out silently. Outside, the snowfall had slowed, a few stray flakes still drifting from the densely packed sky, though the ground was now a uniform white, rippled with violet shadows where the drifts rose and fell. The men-at-arms still waited by the gate, rigid and glassy-eyed with cold; they looked surprised to see me, but their orders were to stop unwanted visitors from getting in, so they let me pass without comment.</p>
<p class="indented">I could hardly feel my feet by the time I had reached the end of rue des Tournelles. The streets appeared ghostly and deserted; not even a seagull cried over the river, and I walked on virgin snow, as yet unmarked by footsteps. As I turned right on to the rue Saint-Antoine I believed myself alone in this strange, blue-white world. Perhaps this belief made me less vigilant; perhaps the snow muffled the sounds around me. I had barely walked twenty yards when out of nowhere a blade appeared at my neck and a voice hissed in my ear,</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nice and still, now. Try not to make a noise.’</p>
