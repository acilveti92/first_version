				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Water!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">No other single word could have created more disruption to the order and discipline of a British army battalion. The fusilier had spied the small stream twisting its way along the shallow valley ahead and joyfully announced its presence to the rest of the regiment. The fusiliers had trudged over the low rise footsore, dehydrated and close to collapse. Yet the single word transformed them. Without a word of command the column stopped, the men quivering with eagerness, like hounds smelling the fox for the first time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Colonel Morris beamed with pride as the men held their ranks despite their desperate desire to drink. Every head turned to stare at the colonel, the same look of longing on all their faces.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Morris could not deny them. ‘Go, my boys! You have earned it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Released, the redcoats streamed forward, the men pulling and elbowing each other in their desperate haste to reach the small stream. Men who minutes earlier had felt ready to lie down and die found the strength to race forward down the shallow slope towards the Bulganak River. They threw themselves into the shallow stream, thrusting their heads into the ice-cold water or cupping their hands and gulping it down their parched throats as fast as they could. And the officers joined them. Colonel Morris alone held back, walking his horse behind the rearmost and slowest moving fusiliers. Only when the drenched fusiliers returned to the north bank of the river, their heavy uniforms soaking but their thirst satiated and their canteens full, did he allow his horse to bow its head so it, too, could drink.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Would you be so kind, Sloames?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stood in the centre of the stream, the slow-moving water rippling around his boots. His stomach ached with the cold water he had gulped down. He looked up to see Morris holding out his canteen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Without a word, Jack reached out, took the canteen and squatted down, removing the stopper as he did so. It was only when he handed the full container back did he see the strain on Morris’s face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Obliged to you.’ Morris tipped back his head and took a long draught from the canteen, closing his eyes at the exquisite pleasure of the fresh water cascading down his throat. It took several seconds before he lowered the canteen, leaving a few errant drops of water captured in the wiry grey hairs of his beard.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Morris replaced the stopper. ‘Mr Sloames, form your company, if you please. We have work to do.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A troop of the 13th Light Dragoons splashed noisily through the river. The horses’ hooves flung the water high into the air so that the bright sunlight flashed off thousands of droplets. More dragoons were riding down the shallow slope towards the river. The cavalrymen looked down in disdain at the soaked fusiliers as they rode past, their sneers and shouted insults leaving the redcoats wondering who the true enemy was. Jack looked to the south, the direction the cavalry was taking. There, half a mile distant, Russian cossacks lined the brow of the hill.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A chill ran down Jack’s spine. Muttering imprecations, he went to form up his company.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Jesus Christ! If they could bleeding shoot straight they’d be fucking dangerous.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Silence in the ranks!’ Sergeant Baker snarled from his place behind the company, his eyes scanning the men as he tried to identify the culprit. The redcoats stood stoically in their ranks, as the sun beat down. The sweat poured freely down their bodies and faces but at least they had a grandstand view of the afternoon’s entertainment.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The battalion was deployed in a line two ranks deep, spread like a long red chain on the brow of the shallow slope to the south of the Bulganak River. It had not taken the 13th Light Dragoons long to drive off the few cossacks who had been observing the movements of the army and the fusiliers had been ordered forward to take up position on the crest of the slope the cossacks had vacated. To their front, Lord Cardigan had led the light cavalry forward in skirmish order and for the last twenty minutes they had been engaged in a vigorous but so far ineffectual exchange of gunfire with a large body of Russian cavalry. Neither side appeared capable of hitting their targets. From their vantage point on the low crest, the fusiliers watched in disappointment as the brisk exchange of fire failed to inflict a single casualty on either side.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It reminds me very much of a review day at Chobham.’ Captain McCulloch had wandered over to join the Light Company, making his observation as he approached where Jack stood observing the afternoon’s display. McCulloch’s 2nd Company was formed on the Light Company’s right flank. The Light Company itself was the furthest left of the whole battalion, with Captain Brewer and his grenadiers at the opposite end on the battalion’s right flank.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">This was the first time the two officers had spoken since the night of Jack’s abuse of Major Peacock.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I wouldn’t know as I never had the pleasure, although I hear review days are about as interesting as listening to Brewer fart. At least our damn cavalry are not spoiling the spectacle by actually hitting something.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">McCulloch winced at the colourful language. ‘So you have not yet learnt to moderate your language, Sloames.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, I’m afraid I haven’t, nor do I think I ever shall.’ He turned to face McCulloch. ‘But I have learnt to appreciate when I’m being a complete fool. I can only apologise for my appalling behaviour. It was unacceptable and I truly regret that it ever happened.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">McCulloch met Jack’s intense gaze. A moment’s scrutiny was all it took for him to believe Jack was telling the truth. ‘Let us hear no more about it then. Let bygones be bygones and all that.’ McCulloch lifted his shako by its peak and wiped his hand across his sweat-streaked forehead. He slicked his damp hair down with a grimace of distaste.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you.’ Jack offered McCulloch his hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There’s no need for that, old fellow,’ said McCulloch, shaking Jack’s hand anyhow. ‘We all have our off days.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack and McCulloch stood in companionable silence watching the British cavalry engage their Russian counterparts in a wasteful and ineffective duel of musketry. The sight of a single Russian trooper silently crumpling over and falling to the ground raised such a cheer from the watching British troops that the cavalrymen of both sides turned to look at the source of the huge hurrah.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sporadic gunfire soon resumed and proved as wasteful as before. The mute participation of the British infantryman became languid and sleepy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">General Raglan steadfastly refused to allow the infantry to join the attack. He was anxious to avoid a general action until his army was consolidated and so he held his men back, refusing to be drawn into a precipitate advance. There was nothing for the infantry to do other than to roast in the sun and endure the heat, the flies, the boredom and the thirst. The foolishness of the inactivity was not lost on the battalion’s officers as a steady trickle of men collapsed from heatstroke, victims to their general’s feckless caution.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Aha! This looks more like it. Action at last,’ McCulloch said happily, announcing a change in the tiresome skirmish.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had been engaged in a battle of his own as he fought to keep his heavy eyelids from closing. The effects of the long march and the cavalry’s ineptitude had combined to leave him struggling to stay awake. It was with some difficulty that he lifted his gritty and sore eyes to see what had caught McCulloch’s attention.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A squadron of Russian cavalry spurred towards the British dragoons’ left flank, the first purposeful movement either side had managed for the last half hour.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With a precision that put the languid movements of the British cavalrymen to shame, the Russian cavalry opened in the centre, the separate halves of the squadron peeling back left and right, revealing the battery of guns they had so skilfully been screening.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Oh, well done. Well done indeed!’ McCulloch could not resist praising the beautifully executed manoeuvre.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian artillery opened fire as the last of their cavalry spurred their way clear, the puffs of smoke from the mouths of their cannon clearly visible moments before the noise of the cannonade could be heard.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There! We are privileged indeed, Sloames. We have witnessed the first cannon of the campaign being fired.’ McCulloch pulled hard on the hem of his jacket and picked a small bit of lint from his lapel as he spoke, as if to be present at such a historic moment made him uncomfortable.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Let us hope our cavalry is pleased. I’m not sure I’d be so keen to see the first cannon shot of the campaign if I was on the receiving end of it as they are.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">McCulloch chose to ignore Jack’s somewhat caustic observation. ‘I had better get back to my company. I’m glad we had the opportunity to talk.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Enjoy the day, Mr McCulloch, and don’t forget, <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">aut vincere aut mori</span>.’ Jack mangled the Latin phrase he had heard for the first time on the night of his confrontation with Major Peacock.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His sarcasm brought a wry smile of acknowledgement from McCulloch. ‘Mr Sloames, you are incorrigible. God willing I shall see you later and we can work on your pronunciation. You sounded like a constipated clergyman.’ McCulloch nodded his farewell and left Jack to enjoy the display the cavalrymen were putting on.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A battery of British horse artillery careered to a noisy halt a short distance to the left of Jack’s company, stung into action by the skill of the Russian horse artillery.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The suddenness of their arrival stirred many of the Light Company from their sun-induced stupor. The gunners prepared their weapons to fire to the clipped orders of their sergeants. The sight was of much greater interest than the shambolic performance of the skirmishing cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian artillery fired a second volley before the British gunners were ready to reply. From their elevated viewpoint, the Light Company could trace the pencil-thin track the roundshot left as they flew through the air towards the dispersed ranks of the cavalry. In the widely spaced skirmish order, the dragoons and hussars offered a poor target for the Russian gunners and the heavy barrage struck down only a single dragoon.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">An ear-ringing explosion of noise and smoke to the Light Company’s left announced that the British battery was returning fire. Far to the battalion’s right a second British battery opened up, the deep cough of these guns identifying them as bigger bored nine-pounders.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Despite the cloud of foul-smelling powder smoke that partially blocked the fusiliers’ view, it was clear the British were directing their fire with greater effect than their Russian counterparts. Several Russian cavalrymen and horses were struck by the first British volley. The Russian gunners bravely fired again, resolutely sticking to their task despite the storm of roundshot that crashed about their ears. It was a courageous display but one that only served to goad the British gunners to greater energy. With another explosion of noise and smoke, the British guns fired again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">When the smoke cleared, the fusiliers could see that the Russian gunners had seen sense. With a haste born of fear, they hurried to limber their guns before the British fired on them once more.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British gunners would not let the Russian gunners skulk away unmolested. The artillerymen were serving their guns with intensity and rivers of sweat streamed down their powder-stained faces as they raced to reload. Within moments, another British volley crashed out, and then another, maiming and killing indiscriminately.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers watched in subdued silence as the British artillery exacted a dreadful toll on the retreating enemy gunners. Soon they witnessed the devastating power of artillery close up as the few British casualties were brought back towards the rear. One young hussar trooper had been draped unconscious across his saddle. His body jerked like a rag doll, a bleeding, tattered stump all that remained of one of his legs. The gory sight of the man’s ripped limb, the bone and flesh mangled into something unrecognisable as being human, turned many a stomach among the watching men.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">This time the fusiliers had been able to stand on the sidelines and watch as other young soldiers experienced the raw horror of war. A few miles to the south the main body of the Russian army waited. Tomorrow the King’s Royal Fusiliers would have to take their place in the battle line and face the stark reality of battle for themselves.</p>
