				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Isabel crouched behind the boulder, transfixed by the gory spectacle going on no more than two dozen yards from where she hid. For as long as she could remember she had read about battle, captivated by the dry, urbane accounts of campaigns and set-piece war written by generals and commanders. She had devoured every book she could find, from Livy to Wellington, yet she had never before contemplated the brutality that she saw unfurling before her. The dusty, emotionless words did nothing to convey the dreadful struggle in which men hacked and gouged in a desperate fight to kill or be killed. There was no glory in war, and the sordid, squalid sight she was witnessing left her struggling to control the waves of nausea that lurched through her body.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The black-robed leader of the enemy horde detached himself from the fighting. Even across the yards of scrub she felt his eyes bore into her. Her throat constricted in fear as he eased his charger round, turning its head to face where she hid, before kicking the mount into motion, riding straight for her. He never once let his eyes leave her, staring into her terrified gaze as he rode down the slope.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Danbury!’ The scream tore from her throat as the heavily armoured figure slid from his horse a few yards in front of her. The man was huge, a figure from a nightmare, his robes the colour of night, his black eyes pitiless. He was a vision of hell manifest on earth.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Agile despite his bulk, the huge warrior landed gently on his feet. Isabel saw the purpose in his action. Fear surged through her, a visceral wave of animal terror more powerful than anything she had ever known. It burst out of her like a river in flood breaching its banks.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Danbury! Danbury!’ She shrieked his name in panic, her voice shrill.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The black-robed figure was unmoved, no trace of emotion visible behind the beard that smothered his face. He lifted a single gauntleted hand, holding it towards her as if inviting her to dance. Her fear reasserting itself, she stood mute, powerless to resist.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Come.’ The man’s voice was soft, barely above a whisper, and Isabel struggled to hear the single command over the cacophony of the fight that carried on regardless of her plight. The fingers encased in thick black leather gloves flexed, beckoning her to him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">She felt her body jerk into motion as if tugged forward by an invisible chain. She thought nothing of the silver revolver she still held in her left hand, the idea of resisting never once entering her mind. Her movements felt ponderous, as if the ground was cloying mud rather than dusty soil. Her eyes fixed on the face that observed her progress with serenity and she reached out her free hand, demurely offering it as if she were shyly accepting a suitor’s request for a dance at a dowager’s ball.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">She laid her small hand in the centre of the leather gauntlet and surrendered.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The ambushers swarmed forward, surrounding the small group of sepoys, forcing Jack back into the fight. He flicked his sword out, deflecting a richly jewelled talwar that reached for his eyes, then brought his own blade around in a glittering arc to parry an ancient bayonet-tipped musket that was thrust at his stomach. More blades reached forward, the enemy’s courage growing with every second as the wild horde sensed the weakness in the tiring sepoys.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The first of Jack’s men went down, a pig-sticking spear finding its way past his jabbing bayonet. The leaf-shaped head slid through the thick scarlet coat and into the sepoy’s flesh, the fiendish shriek of triumph emitted by its owner the last sound the dying soldier would ever hear. The sight of the first red-coated devil falling to the ground galvanised the rest of the mob. Those too cunning, or too fearful, to have been at the forefront of the attack sensed the change, belatedly pushing forward, their desire to fight kindled now that victory seemed certain.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">As one the mob closed on the small band of soldiers that had fought with such courage. Like a pack of wild dogs they flung themselves into the fight, each keen to wet their blade in the sepoys’ blood, eager for the gory proof of their valour.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The surviving members of the escort did not stand a chance. The enemy swarmed around them, countless blades whirling, attacks coming from all sides. Yet still the sepoys fought on, stamping their feet forward, thrusting their bayonets at the bodies that pressed against them, their leaden arms and aching muscles forced to continue the fight, the soldiers of the foreign Queen refusing to submit meekly to their fate.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Above the cacophony of the fight, Jack heard Isabel scream his assumed name. He shoved a naked fanatic backwards with his shoulder, using the point of his sword to tear a fist-sized hole in the man’s grease-covered stomach, then forced his way out of the vicious melee, his blunted sword bludgeoning those of the ambushers seeking to attack the rear of the sepoys’ fragile formation. He had no concept of how long they had fought, the passage of time meaningless in the grotesque struggle where a single heartbeat could pass between life and death. All he knew was that Isabel’s terrified scream was a call for help he had to heed.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Free of the fight, Jack ran hard, ignoring the spasm of pain in the pit of his spine and the dreadful ache in his sword arm, focusing his attention on the tall figure that loomed over Isabel’s tiny frame. At any second he expected the man to turn, to react to the single foolish redcoat charging towards him. But the black-robed giant stayed facing Isabel, his back left undefended and exposed. It gave Jack an opportunity, and he strained every tired sinew as he strove to reach Isabel and somehow drag her to safety.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The ground passed slowly under his boots, the uneven surface twisting each footfall. He was certain his legs would give way at any moment, buckling under the strain of racing down the slope to send him tumbling and falling to the floor. Yet somehow he kept his footing, and he counted off the seconds as he hurtled towards the black-robed figure. Yard by yard, step by step he closed the gap between them, no longer hearing the attackers’ shouts of victory or the thunder of his own heartbeat in his ears.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He screamed as he charged, the final few yards disappearing in a sudden rush as he flung himself at the huge man, releasing his tension into a blow aimed at the back of the bandit’s neck. It was a vicious attack, driven by all of Jack’s anger at the futility of the desperate fight. His sword vibrated in his hand as it sliced through the air, the aching muscles in his forearm already bracing for the moment of impact, for the shock of the blade ripping into the enemy leader’s flesh.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The talwar came out of nowhere. The black-robed figure spun round, his richly decorated blade whispering upwards with the speed of a striking cobra, the huge two-handed sword blocking the blow that had been a heartbeat away from ending his life.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The counterattack smashed Jack’s sword to one side, violently deflecting his blade away. Jack was immediately thrown completely off balance and he tumbled to the floor, hitting the stony ground with a bone-jarring thump. As he fell, the talwar flickered through the air, missing his head by a fraction of an inch.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack threw himself to one side as soon as he hit the ground, using the momentum of his fall to roll away from his enemy, ignoring the stabs of agony as his body scraped across the rocky soil. Once, twice the talwar stabbed downwards, missing him by no more than a hair’s breadth, the attacks coming at him so fast that he could do nothing but throw himself down the slope and hope that he could avoid the deadly blade.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His wild tumble gained momentum, the incline of the slope adding speed to his movement. He sensed another attack, the flash of the talwar slicing through the air inches from his nose. The blade went wide; it gave Jack the slightest of openings and he pushed with his legs, scrabbling for purchase. He scrambled to his feet with as much speed as he could muster, and with a dull clang his notched and pitted sword met the dreadful talwar. His desperate parry battered the blade to one side, saving him moments before his enemy’s sword would have been thrust into his guts.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The fierce surge of elation at once again being able to fight was short-lived. The black-robed figure stepped forward, unleashing a flurry of attacks that had Jack sliding backwards as he struggled to counter the pace of his enemy’s movements. The talwar sliced through the air, each slash followed within a heartbeat by another, a relentless salvo that drove him back down the slope, his sword arm ringing as he blocked each blow as best he could.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘For pity’s sake, shoot him,’ he screamed at Isabel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">She gave no sign of having heard him. The small silver revolver was still clutched in her left hand, but it hung uselessly by her side, the terrified girl giving no thought to the weapon that she had brandished with such defiance only a short time before.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack twisted to one side, his attempt to get Isabel’s attention momentarily distracting him and nearly letting the black-robed swordsman’s blade slip past his faltering defence. Again and again he parried the fast-moving talwar. He was forced to forget Isabel as he fought for his life, every ounce of his strength needed to counter the terrifying rain of blows that came at him one after another, each driven by a strength he could barely match.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The black-robed figure started to chant as he fought. Underscored by the metallic clash of swords, the deep voice rumbled in a hypnotic rhythm. Jack did his best to pay no heed to the words, but they unsettled him nonetheless, the menace in the foreign phrases clear.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">With a loud cry the chant stopped. The black-robed figure paused for no more than a single heartbeat before his sword whirled through the air, slashing towards Jack in a blow of immense power.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack thrust his battered sabre forward. His speed saved him, the two blades coming together a fraction of a second before the talwar would have crashed into his unprotected head. Yet the noise of the impact was wrong. With a dull thud, Jack’s sabre shattered, the cheap steel cleaved in half by the power of the bandit leader’s attack. He could only stare in horror as the top half of his weapon spun away, leaving only the shattered stump in his hand.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack’s stubborn defence was ended, leaving him unarmed and defenceless. He felt the shadow of death loom over him as the black-robed figure pulled back his sword arm, preparing the thrust that Jack could no longer counter. He looked into his enemy’s face and knew he was about to die.</p>
