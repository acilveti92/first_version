				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack slowly became aware of the shouting, the cacophony of bellowing voices, the noise and bustle of soldiers, the dusty floor reverberating to the thump of army boots, the air full of braying voices of command.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stay where you are, Lark.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Firm hands took hold of his upper arms, holding him hard as if he was expected to make a bolt for the door at any moment.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack blinked hard at the tears clouding his vision and tried to make sense of what was happening.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The room was full of redcoats. Half a dozen soldiers crowded into the cramped confines of the laundry’s outer reception room.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Molly?’ Jack’s voice wavered as he spoke.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Easy, lad. Behave yourself now.’ The voice was firm, devoid of compassion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Where’s Slater?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Colour Sergeant Slater is in the guardroom. God alone knows what happened here but it’s over now.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The horror surged through Jack’s mind. His head sagged with despair and he would have fallen had the two redcoats not been holding him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Come on, lad, time to sort yourself out. You have to come with us. You’ve raised one hell of a shit storm and you’re right at the damn centre.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It was Slater, he—’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stow it. Save it for the colonel because I ain’t interested. I’ve been told to take you to the guardroom and keep you there.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Guardroom?’ Jack’s head lifted and he stared at the corporal of the guard. He felt the redcoats holding him tighten their grip on his arms. Jack closed his eyes as he realised the small party of redcoats had not come to his rescue, they were here to detain him. To lock him away while the officers made sense of the dreadful events that had led to a young woman losing her life.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Attention!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The door to the guardroom was snatched open and the corporal stationed outside the room commanded the room’s occupants to rise. The three wooden chairs scraped the floor in unison as the officer strode in. Jack had been sitting in morose silence, guarded by two of his fellow redcoats. Now he stood and stared at the figure of Captain Sloames who looked back at him with a mixture of disappointment and embarrassment.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At ease. Thank you, Corporal, you and your men may leave us.’ Sloames dismissed the men charged with guarding the prisoner. He kept up his scrutiny of Jack’s face as he did so, as if trying to discern his orderly’s guilt in his expression.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘This is a most distressing episode, Lark, most distressing.’ Sloames held his hands behind his back and paced slowly around the room, looking more like a lawyer than an officer in the Queen’s army. ‘I have sent a message to the colonel and he has charged me to discover what events led to today’s terrible accident and to take whatever action I deem necessary. I have listened to Colour Sergeant Slater’s account of the events and in the interests of justice I would like to hear your side of the story.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked at his officer, barely hearing the words spoken to him. He didn’t feel the pain in his body, the effects of Slater’s beating not registering in his mind. But his soul felt as if it had been cleaved in two.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Silence won’t help you now, Lark.’ Sloames spoke slowly as if to a difficult child. ‘You must tell me what happened.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Slater.’ Jack whispered the name. ‘Slater killed her.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames closed his eyes as if in sudden pain. He looked at Jack for what seemed like a long time before he spoke again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Slater accuses you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Slater’s a fucking liar.’ Jack’s voice was raw.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames’s mouth twisted in distaste. ‘Mind your tongue. Need I remind you that you are in a great deal of trouble? One more such outburst and I shall leave this room immediately and abandon you to your fate. Is that clear?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack struggled to contain his grief. He knew how the battalion worked; Tom Black’s savage flogging on a false charge was all the evidence Jack needed to understand that nothing he could say would make a jot of difference. Slater had committed the foulest crime but Jack could not touch him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames took Jack’s silence as leave to continue.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Now. I have listened to Colour Sergeant Slater’s account. It is clear there has been a most dreadful accident.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Accident?’ Jack could not fully believe what he was hearing. ‘Slater was trying to rape her! I stopped him and he killed her.’ Jack felt his eyes fill. ‘He killed her!’ he shouted, his voice wavering with pain.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The room returned to silence.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I will carry out a full and proper investigation, Lark, I can assure you of that.’ Sloames’s discomfort was obvious. ‘However, without any witnesses the situation is very . . .’ he paused, an apologetic smile on his face, ‘difficult. It may not surprise you to know that Slater blames you for the incident. He claims he tried to stop you attacking the girl and you fought him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And because Slater is a fucking sergeant he gets away with it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames scowled. ‘There is a proper process that will be followed.’ He lowered his voice, coming to stand next to Jack so he could speak softly and still be heard. ‘But it really is better for everyone if the details of this most dreadful accident are cleared up without delay.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Better for who?’ Jack sneered the words.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames didn’t rise to the bait. ‘We have to think of the regiment, Lark.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked into his officer’s face. He could see Sloames’s distress, he was too used to being with his master to miss it. He let his head fall so that his chin rested on his chest. None of this was Sloames’s fault. And nothing would bring Molly back. Jack felt his grief wash over him, obliterating his anger in a wave of misery.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Slater will not be allowed to get away with this, Jack. He will be punished.’ Sloames placed his hand on Jack’s shoulder.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack inhaled deeply. He knew who was to blame. It didn’t matter what the army did or didn’t do.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly was gone.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames patted Jack’s shoulder. ‘I will speak to the colonel. In the circumstances I’m sure he would be content if we were to leave quickly.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So the whole thing will be hushed up.’ Jack spoke in a matter-of-fact manner, holding on to his calmness with a huge effort of will.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We must consider the name of the regiment. Nothing good will come of a scandal.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack felt defeat wash over him. He let the tears come, felt them scalding his cheeks as he wept for his loss.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames backed away, sensitive to his orderly’s distress. As he reached the door, he turned to speak one last time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We are to go to war, Lark. I said we would go together and we shall. We shall leave this place and find us both a new life.’ Sloames paused. ‘You will always have a place at my side, Jack. No matter what happens, I shall not abandon you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames quietly opened the door, leaving Jack alone for the first time since Molly’s death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack slumped back into his chair and succumbed to his grief. Through his tears he felt a part of his being harden. Like a rock in a wild, surging river, his desire for revenge stood firm against the torrent of despair.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">One day Slater would be made to pay for his crime.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">It was dark when the coach pulled through the barrack gatehouse and trundled on to the road that led to London. The lamps on the coach cast out a miserly light, throwing shadows on to the streets. The barracks and the sentries stationed outside for the long dreary hours of guard duty quickly melted into the darkness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">From his perch on top of the carriage, Jack stared back at his former home, his lonely vigil kept long after it had disappeared from sight. As the coach picked its way out of the confines of the narrow streets, he buried his head in his heavy greatcoat, turning up the wide collar so that it smothered his face. Hiding the tears that flowed freely down his cheeks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Beneath him, from within the warm fug of the coach’s interior, the sound of comradely laughter could be heard. Captain Sloames and the other passengers had already enjoyed the first of numerous bottles of claret they had with them to keep out the cold. The sound of their laughter did nothing to warm the chill in Jack’s soul, their mirth only adding to his loneliness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His back ached abominably, the jarring ride sending sharp spasms of pain running up and down his spine. He closed his eyes, concentrating on the pain, savouring the stabs of agony, using them to forget his despair.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had been taken under guard from his confinement directly to Sloames’s rooms where he had quickly packed for their hurried departure. He had remained in the rented rooms until the hired coach had arrived to spirit them away, taking them away from the place where Jack had hoped to find such happiness. Like a felon fleeing the scene of his crime, he was disappearing into the night.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The carriage quickly picked up speed as it bucked and scrabbled its way on to the turnpike. Jack gripped his seat hard, enduring the discomfort and the cold as best he could. Despite everything that had happened, he felt a tremble of excitement deep inside him, a tiny frisson of expectation that he had embarked on a great journey that would take him to the far reaches of the globe. He was a soldier on his way to war.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A new path to the future was opening up before him. No one, least of all him, could see where it would take him.</p>
