				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘King’s Royal Fusiliers! Battalion will advance! Advance!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was a few minutes past noon.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To their intense disappointment, the Light Company had been ordered to fight in the main battalion line, behind the Greenjackets of the 95th Rifles. The Light Company were the trained skirmishers in the battalion, used to fighting on their own, strung out in extended order in front of the battalion, screening the dense ranks from the withering fire of the enemy’s skirmishers. But instead of advancing with the Greenjackets, the Light Company were expected to fire the disciplined volleys of a regular company, adding their rifles to the power of the massed battalion ranks. Jack would have revelled in the opportunity to lead his company forward on its own but for reasons he could not fathom the generals had decided otherwise.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The long red line moved forward at the command, each man’s heart beating a little faster. In the centre of the battalion line, the drummer boys beat out the time of the march, the young boys barely big enough to carry the huge instruments that hung heavily from the leather bands that held them pressed against their stomachs. To the front of the drummers marched the battalion colours, two huge squares of coloured silk which embodied the battalion’s honour and pride.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A pair of colour sergeants armed with fearsome halberds, a weapon that harked back to the days when all fighting was done hand-to-hand, guarded each colour. The sergeants were there to protect the colours at all costs; they would use their formidable weapons to hack and gut any enemy who tried to steal them. Two young ensigns carried the heavy colours with pride. To be chosen was a distinction, one that would be long remembered and cherished – if they survived. The honour came with a price, for the gaudy squares of silk were certain to draw the fire of enemy sharpshooters.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">One ensign carried the Queen’s colour, an enormous Union Jack proudly emblazoned with the regimental crest in its centre. The second held aloft the battalion’s regimental colour of vibrant blue, with the crossed fusils of the regiment’s badge picked out in gold thread. The regiment’s battle honours were sewn in the same gold thread, in two columns, one either side of the badge. Each place name was highlighted by a rectangle of blood-red silk, in honour of the fusiliers who had gone before, who had fought and died under the same twin flags. The battle honours read like a chronicle of the British army. Deig. Corunna. Nive. Peninsula. Waterloo. The names resonated with history, and the six hundred fusiliers marching towards the massed ranks of the Russian army were about to take their place in it.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘For the love of God!’ Fusilier Dawson exclaimed, echoing the sentiments of all the company as the enemy artillery opened fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Silence in the ranks! The next person to speak will find themselves the proud owner of a new arsehole.’ Sergeant Baker made his presence felt from his position behind the rear rank. His eyes roved over the company, ready to pounce on any lack of discipline.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">From his place in the centre of the front rank, Slater laughed at the sergeant’s coarse words. He ignored the looks of disgust his fellow redcoats shot his way. He fed on their hatred, nurturing it, savouring it, adding it to the bitterness that burned inside him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt no trace of fear as the company marched obediently into the barrage of fire but he was no fool, he knew the danger he faced. Fate was a fickle goddess but he trusted to her to keep him alive to deliver the justice he craved.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had vowed that Jack Lark would meet his own fate today. Lark had dared to cheat his destiny, stealing a life and a place in the world far removed from that allotted to him. He would not cheat death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">High in the sky two black dots emerged from the cloud of smoke that enveloped the lines of Russian cannon. Every fusilier watched anxiously as the shot flew through the air towards them, covering the distance in a heartbeat. The roundshot smashed into the ground in front of the battalion, gouging a thick channel out of the earth before bouncing back high into the air and over the heads of the men.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A ragged cheer erupted from the redcoats, the men finding the breath to hoot their derision. Without breaking step, the redcoats treated the first artillery fire they had ever experienced with gleeful disdain.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fusilier Trotter!’ Jack singled out one of his men who marched close to Slater. ‘I thought you were the battalion’s wicketkeeper. Why didn’t you take that one?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Too much pace on it, sir. I thought I’d leave it for the long stops in the guards!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was not much of a joke but the company laughed as if the finest comedian from the Palladium was among them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers marched on, advancing as only the British advanced – devoid of fanfare, stoic and steady. The line moving forward with deadly purpose.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Open the ranks!’ Jack yelled, tracking the pencil-thin trace that marked the path of incoming roundshot. The Russian batteries were sending their fire into the advancing red line from all along the enemy’s position and one black dot was heading straight for his company. Jack screamed at his men to move, his heart in his mouth as he prayed they were quick enough to get out of its way.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers in its path scattered. Like an express train roaring through a station, the shot sped through the opening, its horrifying passage startling in its violence. It smashed into the ground behind the company before flying over the heads of the Scots fusiliers who marched directly behind them in the ranks of the 1st Division.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Scottish troops greeted the fusiliers’ desperate antics with loud whoops and catcalls of derision, gleefully mocking the undignified display.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sergeant Shepherd manhandled the men back into the ordered ranks which had continued to move purposefully forward even as their fellows dodged the deadly missile. Jack scanned the sky, ever vigilant for danger aimed at the Light Company.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘King’s Royal Fusiliers! Prepare to halt! Halt!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men had advanced close enough to the burning village of Burliuk to feel the heat. Dirty grey smoke swirled around the ruined houses. There was no cover for the redcoats but the smoke screened their movements from the Russian gunners and prevented the use of their range markers so that they were forced to shoot blind. But the British troops were simply too numerous to miss completely.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Captain Devine’s 3rd Company was hit, the roundshot ploughing through a file of redcoats in a gory shower of bone and blood. The fusiliers stood silent and still, stoic as two of their fellows were reduced to pathetic, twisted corpses in the blink of an eye.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Colonel Morris left his place in the centre of the battalion, urging his huge black horse forward. ‘Lie down! Lie down!’ He rode along the front of the fusiliers’ line, waving his hat over his head to emphasise the urgent order.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good fellows! It won’t be long now. Well done, my boys.’ Morris turned his horse when he reached the battalion’s left flank, nodding a friendly greeting to Jack as he did so. He trotted easily back along the front of his battalion, repeating words of comfort, showing himself to his men, letting them see that he shared their danger.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men lay on the ground, the heat from the sun and the burning village making them sweat in their thick red jackets. Their officers remained on their feet, stoically standing in their allotted positions, setting an example to their men despite the terror fluttering in their bellies.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was impossible for the redcoats to avoid the enemy fire now they were lying down but it was also harder for the Russian gunners to hit them. Most of the roundshot bounced harmlessly over the prostrate soldiers, wasting their power on the clammy soil which erupted in spectacular fountains of earth.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Volley after volley hammered across the plain. The British soldiers lay on the ground beneath the cannonade and endured as best they could, many seeking solace in their God, their lips moving in silent prayers for deliverance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There was nothing else to be done.</p>
