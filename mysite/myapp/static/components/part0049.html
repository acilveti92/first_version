				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The defenders sat in an uneasy silence. The hour had passed swiftly, the time spent in rushed preparations, the tired men harried as they prepared to fight again. Ammunition had to be distributed, weapons cleaned and reloaded and water had to be drawn from the well just outside the 24th’s barracks. Wounds had to be dressed and the dying cared for, whilst all the while watching for the enemy to reappear.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack had been forced to reduce the number of men stationed on the roof of the barracks to just five, under the command of a corporal. It was not ideal, but the 24th had lost nine men in the first assault and there would be too few to defend the barracks if he left the original number to act as sharpshooters. He had retained his small flying squad, although this time he had vowed not to do anything as reckless as throw himself out of the window and into the middle of the enemy.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Why don’t the buggers come, and get it over with?’ Private Jenkins asked the question that was on every redcoat’s mind. The waiting played at their nerves, the fear scratching at them, an itch that could not be ignored.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Are you off somewhere special then, Private?’ Jack had been peering out of the same window as the anxious redcoat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I just want it over with, Mud. I mean, sir.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘We all do.’ Jack unbuttoned his holster and made sure his sword was loose in its scabbard. The rest of his men were doing the same, fiddling with their kit as they went through the superstitious rituals that they believed might be the difference between life and death, each fearing the dreadful lottery they would soon have to face.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘They are brave, aren’t they now, those blue-coated buggers? They nearly got in here last time. For a moment I thought it was going to be like Chillianwala all over again.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You were there?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I was, bach. Bloody slaughtered, we were. There were only five of us left standing in my company when it was over. Those Sikh boys fight damn hard.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well we stopped this lot once. We’ll just have to do it again.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘That we will, boyo.’ Jenkins had clearly forgotten he should be addressing Jack as an officer. They were just two redcoats standing waiting for the enemy to appear. ‘No bloody heroics this time, though.’ Jenkins had been in the flying squad that had followed Jack on his foolish charge. ‘We are all getting too old for that kind of nonsense.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I can’t promise.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jenkins shook his head despairingly. ‘Officers. They always know best, isn’t that right, bach? No matter how bloody foolish it may be.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The crack of a musket firing prevented Jack from replying. A salvo struck the side of the barracks, each bullet smacking into the stone with an ear-splitting crack. The redcoats came to life, flinching instinctively as the fusillade gouged thick crevices in the heavy stone.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Bloody hell!’ Jenkins lost his shako as he ducked down behind the protective wall of mealie bags that blocked off the lower half of the window. ‘It’s going to be like that now, is it?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Another salvo of musket fire cracked out. The second assault in the battle for Bhundapur was about to begin.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Mark your targets!’ Colour Sergeant Hughes snapped the order as the redcoats cowered from the steady fire. ‘Aim at the smoke.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah’s men had learnt from their first assault. This time there would be no wild charge. The musket fire coming from the windows and doorways of the buildings that lined the pathway leading away from the 24th’s barracks drove the redcoats down behind their walls and barricades.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Yet there was no precision to the enemy fire. There were no massed volleys, the gunmen shooting as they were ready, forcing the defenders to endure a constant barrage that sometimes died away before rising to a climax as half a dozen men fired at once. The cough of each gun sounded different, the redcoats under fire from a collection of weaponry ranging from ancient silver jezzails to Brown Bess muskets that would have been at home on the field at Waterloo. As varied as the guns were, each was still capable of killing if its bullet found its mark, and the redcoats kept as low as they could behind the windows, or stayed carefully to the side of the loopholes that dotted the wall closest to the enemy.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Commence firing!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was taking a risk. He had been tempted to hold back, waiting for a charge. But he had seen the anxiety on the faces of the redcoats as he made them endure the withering fire. He had to let them reply, trusting them to be able to reload in time if an assault looked to be building.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The muskets rang out almost in unison as the men’s tense trigger fingers were finally released. The deeper cough of their percussion muskets drowned out the enemy fire, the effect of nearly sixty guns firing together creating a thunderclap of sound that echoed loudly in the confined barracks.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Reload! Look lively.’ Jack urged. He peered through the window, screwing up his eyes at the inevitable cloud of powder smoke that billowed back to flood the room. He saw a couple of bodies slump to the ground as the 24th’s fire found its target, but it was difficult to tell how effective it had been.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Another smattering of bullets crashed into the barracks, gouging more holes in the already heavily pockmarked walls. It appeared the Maharajah’s men were happy to stay out of sight and engage the 24th in a duel of musketry. It would be a long, tedious war of attrition, but it would pin the redcoats in place, the idea of abandoning the barracks simply unthinkable.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A huge cheer sounded from outside. It was a feral roar, the sound of the mob screaming its hatred. The terrifying noise of warriors released to the charge.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sir!’ Corporal Jones summoned his officer.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack bounded across the room, cursing aloud as an enemy bullet scorched past his ear and knocked a fist-sized lump of plaster from the scarred wall.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sir! Hundreds of the bastards!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack followed the corporal’s pointing finger. The Maharajah had altered his plan of attack, using the hour-long truce to gather together all his remaining foot soldiers. They had been formed into a huge phalanx that was aimed like an enormous fist at the north wall. The Maharajah was gambling everything on a single, massive assault, a sledgehammer blow that would smash a hole in the defenders’ frail perimeter and create an opening for his precious lancers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack stared at the enemy’s massed ranks and saw certain defeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Half the company with me. Colour Sergeant Hughes, keep the rest of the men at the windows and return fire.’ He snapped off his orders. His men responded calmly.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack ran his eye over the Maharajah’s assault, which was already charging towards the north wall. They seemed unstoppable, and the tips of the sepoys’ muskets were wavering as they stared down the barrels of their weapons at the immense horde tearing towards them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fire!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack clearly heard Dutton’s order before the roar of a massed volley crashed out. The major had timed it to perfection. The enemy horde was no more than fifty yards from the barricade when the horror was unleashed. At such close range the sepoys’ muskets couldn’t miss. The men leading the rush were struck down as if someone had suddenly lifted a rope to trip dozens of them at once. The musket balls tore into the packed formation, flaying the front ranks, the blood bright as bodies were torn and shredded.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Hold them!’ Dutton’s voice was huge in the shocked silence after the volley. His sepoys heard the cry, bracing to meet the wave of hatred that was coming for them. Every inch of the barricade was blocked, the sepoys standing shoulder to shoulder, their wicked bayonets reaching forward and presenting an unbroken front towards the enemy.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Then the screaming began.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The enemy wounded screamed, their voices rising in horror as their bodies were mangled and shredded by the well-timed volley. The living screamed as the shadow of death passed them by, the delight of living turned into a visceral shriek of hatred as they bounded past the ruined bodies of their fellows and used their sabres to hack at the men who had so nearly killed them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">There was no time for the sepoys to reload.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The enemy stepped past the dead and the dying, ignoring the cries for aid as they pressed home their attack. They came at the barricade in a rush, filling every part of the wall, the deep ranks of the mob driving those at the front forward, the power of the charge relentless.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The sepoys stood their ground. They stabbed across the barricade, punching their bayonets into the bodies of their enemies. Time after time they rammed the weapons forward, twisting and recovering the blades before thrusting again, trying to hold back the tide of shrieking devils that swarmed around them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">But there were simply too many men fighting against them. Sharpened spears reached across the barricade. The Maharajah had packed the leading ranks with the weapons, the longer reach of the spears allowing the attackers to stab at the sepoys whilst keeping away from the bayonets that the red-coated soldiers were using with such professionalism.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">All along the barricade the redcoats fell. The long spears found their way past even the most determined defence, the vicious weapons driven deep into the sepoys’ flesh. The enemy leapt forward as soon as a gap in the line appeared, swarming over the barricade before turning and unleashing their talwars at the nearest defenders.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">It was chaos.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton’s men fought on, using the butts of their muskets as clubs, striking back at the enemy that now swarmed around them. They refused to be beaten, and here and there the enemy was driven back over the wall, the desperate defiance of the defenders sealing the gaps.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton charged at the head of his flying squad. They tore into the largest gap, the cough of the major’s revolver loud enough to be heard even above the noise of the violent struggle. The charge drove deep into a pack of the Maharajah’s soldiers that had breached the wall, the sepoys flowing past their commander to ram their bayonets forward, the disciplined charge sending a shudder through the enemy ranks.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Yet too many holes had been torn in the defenders’ perimeter. Even as Dutton’s charge thrust a path into one gap, so another breach was made further down the line. The melee descended into swirling chaos, men fighting in desperation as they sought to kill or be killed. The shrieks of the living added to the screams of the dying to create a cacophony that belonged in hell itself.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A trumpet blared, its rising call clear even over the shrieks of the men fighting for their lives.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah had waited for this moment.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His lancers rode forward, their ranks ordered and precise.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The trumpet called again, and the two lines of cavalry halted, dressing the ranks so that every spacing was in perfect order. The lances were lowered, each man crouching with the dreadful weapon tight under his right armpit, the vicious blade held still.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The trumpet blared for the last time. The lancers kicked their mounts in unison, ordering them forward whilst keeping the line straight, the precision drilled into them by the countless hours of instruction they had endured in preparation for this moment.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The horses lifted their heads, sensing the building excitement. Their riders were forced to pull hard on the reins to keep their mounts in check as they maintained the pace of the walk. The slow, steady movement would soon build into a trot, then a canter, before they were finally released to the madness of the gallop that would see them committed to the attack.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah rode at the lancers’ head, leading his beloved cavalry forward, taking the power of his own sword to fight against those who would strip his descendants of their right to rule.</p>
