				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack rode at Ballard’s side on a horse borrowed from Outram’s stable. It had not taken long to reveal all that he had discovered. If Ballard had been shocked by the revelation, he had not shown it. It had taken barely thirty minutes to secure Outram’s permission for the two intelligence officers to leave the army and race back to Bushire to apprehend the enemy spy. They had left Palmer behind, the bodyguard ordered to guard their possessions and Ballard’s papers. The two men would deal with the spy themselves.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was still not past midday but already the redcoats were going about the gruesome task of sorting the dead from the still living. The battlefield was theirs, the victory complete. Jack and Ballard left the British army as victors of the field and went to finish the job they had started but which had been left unfinished for too long.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The heavens opened. The afternoon sun was hidden behind a bank of thick, rolling clouds that had rushed across the sky to smother the brightness and shroud the land in a dark cloak. The two officers rode on regardless, paying the deluge no heed. They faced a long journey. They would ride on into the night, pushing their horses hard as they sought to cover the miles back to Bushire as quickly as they could.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The crash of thunder and the crack of lightning split the sky. It was as if the gods had been angered by the slaughter and now raged in the heavens, their displeasure manifest in the violent storm. The road the two officers followed became little more than muddy slurry and sand, the slop splattering the horses and riders with a thin covering of foul-smelling muck. The rain fell constantly, driven almost horizontal by the biting northerly wind. The officers could do nothing but endure the tempest and ride onwards, their mission too vital to be turned aside by even the foulest conditions.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack could not ever remember being so weary. His sword arm felt like lead, the muscles deadened by a night and day of fighting. His leg throbbed from the lance wound that was still untended, his throat burnt from the throttling the Russian officer had administered, and his spine felt as if it had been severed, such was the pain in the small of his back. He ignored it all, driven on by the need for revenge on the person he blamed for so much of the suffering, the power of betrayal fuelling his body past the point of exhaustion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The storm raged around him. Every minute was a torment, a torture that would never cease. He endured, staying in the saddle and forcing his horse forward, each step taking him closer to the confrontation he sought.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He thought of nothing. He refused to dwell on the bitter battle or on the fight that had led to Knightly’s death. He felt nothing. No anger. No grief. No remorse.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He rode through the tempest, his soul empty. He rode to exact revenge. He would find the British spy whose identity the Russian papers had revealed. And he was ready to kill.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">They arrived in the dead hours before dawn. It was the time when the camp was at its quietest, the men left behind slumbering through the last of the night. No one remarked on their progress, the two weather-beaten officers left to pick their way through the empty spaces. With so many men with the main column, the camp felt eerily still, the tents silent, only shadows moving through the darkness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard looked across at Jack. They had not spoken for hours, the only exchanges coming when they passed through the network of vedettes and picquets that ringed the British base, keeping it safe from marauding enemy cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Let’s get this done.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded. His did his best to force away the exhaustion. He had one last duty to perform. Then he could rest.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They rode into the staff headquarters. Lieutenant Colonel Shepheard had been left in command of a combined army and naval detachment to safeguard the encampment whilst the column made its lightning attack on the Persians. In the small hours, the headquarters was quiet, only a handful of men left to work through the night.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It did not take long for Ballard to rouse the duty officer, a Captain Campbell, who bustled out of the tent, his surprise at the summons clear. He took one look at the two officers’ bedraggled attire and shouted for an orderly to bring coffee.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do you want a detachment?’ Campbell was brisk and to the point. Ballard had explained to him that they were going to arrest the spy who had dogged the campaign since the beginning.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No.’ Jack spoke for the first time. His voice was brittle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘As you wish.’ Campbell yawned, smothering his mouth with a meaty paw. ‘The first dispatch from the battle only arrived about an hour ago. You must have ridden hard.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He reached for Knightly’s revolver and set about reloading it. His exhaustion was like a lead bar pressing down on his soul. It took an effort to open the pouch on his belt that contained the ammunition, his hands fumbling with the clasp. The cartridges were dry under his fingertips, kept safe against the deluge.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Campbell nodded at Jack’s reaction. He had been in the Crimea and he knew what it felt like after a hard-fought battle. He turned to face Ballard. ‘Do you want anything further from me?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard was looking at Jack, his face creased with concern. He was gambling his career on the events of the next hour. His only weapon was a battered and bloodied charlatan. For the first time, he had doubts.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No.’ Ballard spoke with finality. He turned and fixed Campbell with a grim smile. ‘We will deal with this ourselves.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Sarah Draper sat at her writing table. She had risen early, long before dawn, unable to sleep any longer. She barely slept at all these days. Her nights were long, the charpoy she tried to rest in becoming a bed of thorns when she did lie down. So she wrote, passing the hours of darkness with only the hiss of a gas lamp for company, her paper and ink a solace against the loneliness that swamped her.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The words she wrote comforted her. They had become her release, her salvation. There was a joy in creating images with nothing more than words, the dry, scribbled lines taking on another life as she recorded her thoughts and feelings. When she wrote, she could forget her life, passing into another place, where the choices she had made meant nothing. There was just her and the words she chose. Nothing more.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">She heard footsteps outside her tent. The heavy tread of army boots, scuffing the wooden boards she had arranged outside the tent’s flaps so that she would be spared from muck being traipsed into her abode. She heard the footsteps stop, the boots stomping loudly on the boards.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">She felt a frisson of fear. She expected no one. She spent the nights alone now, no longer seeking to force away her loneliness by taking a lover to her bed. She shook off the feeling of dread, forcing the anxiety from her thoughts. She was in the heart of the British camp. She was safe.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The tent flap was thrown open. The rush of air was cold on her skin. She had time to stand and wrap her linen robe tight around her body before the intruder strode into the tent.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Hello, Sarah.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack took a step forward, moving out of the shadows and into the meagre light cast by the solitary lamp. He heard her gasp of shock as she saw who had come to disturb her rest.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He took another step, and then another. He knew how he looked. How he smelt. He was dressed in the horror of the battlefield, the grime and the blood a visceral reminder of the violence of the fight. He had not taken the time to clean himself, wanting to confront Sarah with the stain of other men’s lives on his clothes; their blood on his hands. He wanted to shock her. To scare her. To somehow communicate just what she had done when she had intervened in the affairs of soldiers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">For Sarah Draper was the spy that Jack had come all this way to kill.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Why do it?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack blurted out the question. He had spent hours thinking of what he would say when he confronted her. The long, miserable hours of the ride had given him plenty of time to imagine this moment, to taste what it would be like to denounce the woman whose bed he had shared. He had considered every emotion, but as she rose to face him, he felt nothing but the bitterness of betrayal.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The question hung in the air. Sarah turned her back on him and carefully placed the steel pen she still carried on top of the paper she had been working on. She leant forward and straightened the papers, leaving them in a neat stack with the pen positioned carefully as a paperweight to stop them being disturbed in the storm she knew was coming.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Her hands fell away from her robe and it opened round her, so that when she turned back to face Jack he would see the outline of the body that had once been the source of such pleasure. She looked into his eyes, searching for an escape.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He raised Knightly’s revolver. The weapon was covered with dirt, the heavy handle still stained with the blood of the Russian officer. He saw Sarah’s face appear over the tip of the barrel, her eyes filling the sight. Her hair was scraped back, tied behind her head so that he could see the whole of her face. She took his breath away, the simple symmetry of her features making her one of the most startlingly beautiful women he had ever seen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He stared into her eyes, just as he had done so many times before. He saw the vitality, the spark of life they contained, the force that still captivated his soul. His finger curled around the trigger, taking up the slack. A single ounce of pressure and the gun would fire. Then the beautiful eyes would glaze over, the life force fading to nothingness before it was replaced by the blank, lifeless stare of death. He had seen it before. He had watched the flicker of life leave Knightly’s eyes, and now he would be the one who would end the same spark in Sarah’s.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He never saw her hand slip behind her back. He was lost in his thoughts, his mind in such turmoil that he didn’t notice her slim fingers slide into the drawer of her writing desk.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m sorry, Arthur.’ Sarah spoke for the first time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The words meant nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack could not know that she was apologising not for what she had done, but for what she was about to do.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The slim pistol only fired a single bullet. It was small, tiny enough to fit into a man’s pocket or a woman’s purse. It was an expensive object, crafted by the best gunsmith as a lady’s weapon of last defence.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah Draper did not hesitate. She did not bother lifting the weapon, but instead fired it from her hip.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The bullet hit Jack before he was fully aware of what was happening. It spun him round, the force of the impact knocking him backwards. His own gun roared, his finger tightening on instinct. But he was already falling backwards, and the bullet went wild, blasting through the tent’s canvas roof.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The agony seared through him. He felt the rush of blood pouring from the wound. The bullet had taken him high on his right arm, searing through his flesh, filling his world with pain. He went down, his bloodied body hitting the floor with all the grace of a falling brick.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah moved fast. She stepped past Jack, barely glancing at the man she had struck down, and threw back the tent flap thinking of nothing but escape.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A strong hand reached from out of the darkness and grabbed her arm, the fingers clawing into her flesh, stopping her headlong flight with a vice-like grip.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Going somewhere?’ Ballard pulled hard, dragging her back into the tent.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah screamed. She shrieked a single word in the darkness, her anguish complete.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard was in no mood to be gentle. He smothered her mouth with his free hand. Without mercy he twisted her arm behind her back and thrust her ahead of him into the tent. She struggled under his grip, trying to free herself, but Ballard was too strong. He pushed her backwards, sending her sprawling on to the charpoy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">She leapt to her feet, her hands twisted like claws, and went for Ballard’s face, her screech of rage like that of a wounded animal. She came at him fast, but he slapped her cheek, battering her back on to the camp bed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stay there!’ He growled the words. His hand stung from the blow he had given her, but he would not hesitate to repeat it if she tried to escape.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah lay sprawled on the charpoy. Her cheek was scarlet, the imprint of his hand clearly visible on her pale skin. Her robe was open, and Ballard saw the lithe body beneath.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned away, refusing to be drawn by the sight. He saw Jack trying to get to his feet, blood oozing from the wound just below his shoulder. His face was pale, drained by the agony of the bullet.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard heard footsteps. He had time to turn to face the tent’s entrance just as it was thrown open and a man burst in. He carried a naked blade, the bared steel glinting in the light of the gas lamp.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah had not screamed in terror. She had called for help.</p>
