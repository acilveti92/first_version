His bushy eyebrows shielded dark, cavernous eye sockets, and a sardonic smile often hovered over his thin lips. Born in Poland, he was reputed to be an ascetic, a modest man of flawless integrity; but his rivals claimed he was a dangerous and fierce megalomaniac. A longtime member of the Haganah, Big Isser was the director of a private <span class="ref-pnum">construction</span> company in Haifa. He was a loner, silent and unsociable, and lived with his wife and son in a small, windswept house in the coastal village of Bat Galim.</p><p id="p116" class="text-indent">Shortly before the creation of Israel, Be’eri had been appointed head of the Shai by the commanders of the Haganah. When independence was declared, on May 14, 1948, Israel was attacked from all sides by its neighbors, and Be’eri became the head of the newborn military secret service. Be’eri was active in the left wing of the Labor movement and had excellent political connections. His friends and colleagues praised his devotion to the defense of Israel. The Independence War would go on until April 1949.</p><p id="p117" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_27"></a>Yet, soon after Be’eri became head of the secret service, strange events—seemingly unrelated—started to occur.</p><p id="p118" class="text-indent">A couple of hikers on Mount Carmel made a grisly discovery. In a deep gully at the foot of the mountain they found a half-burned body riddled with bullets. It was identified as a well-known Arab informant, Ali Kassem. His assassins had shot him, and then tried to burn his body.</p><p id="p119" class="text-indent">Some weeks later, at a secret meeting with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, Big Isser accused Abba Hushi, an influential leader of Mapai—<span class="ref-pnum">Ben-Gurion’s</span> party—of being a traitor and a British agent. Ben-Gurion was stunned. Great Britain had been the ruling power in Palestine before the establishment of the State of Israel; the Haganah carried an underground struggle against its restrictions on the Jewish community. British <span class="ref-pnum">intelligence</span> had frequently tried to plant their spies inside the Jewish leadership. But Abba Hushi, a pillar of the Jewish community and the charismatic leader of Haifa’s workers—a traitor? It seemed impossible. At first, Israel’s leaders indignantly dismissed Be’eri’s accusation. But Be’eri had found two confidential telegrams sent by British intelligence from Haifa’s post office in May 1948. He laid them on Ben-Gurion’s desk—irrefutable evidence of Hushi’s treachery.</p><p id="p120" class="text-indent">At the same time, Be’eri ordered the arrest of a friend of Hushi’s, Jules Amster. Be’eri had Amster brought to a salt deposit in Atlit, outside Haifa, had him beaten and tortured for seventy-six days, and pressured him to admit that Hushi was a despicable traitor. Amster refused to yield, and was finally released, a broken man. His teeth were gone, his legs were covered with wounds and scars, and he was haunted for years by fear.</p><p id="p121" class="text-indent">On June 30, 1948, while shopping at a Tel Aviv market, army captain Meir Tubiansky was arrested and brought to Beth Giz, a recently occupied Arab village. It was suspected by military intelligence that Tubiansky, while in Jerusalem, had disclosed top-secret information to a British national, who, in his turn, had passed it to the Arab Legion, Jordan’s army. The <span class="ref-pnum">Jordanian</span> artillery, acting on that information, had heavily shelled several <span class="ref-pnum">strategic</span> targets throughout Jerusalem. In a summary court-martial that lasted less than an hour, Tubiansky was accused of being a spy for the Arabs, <a id="pagebreak-rw_28"></a>found guilty, and sentenced to death. A hastily assembled firing squad <span class="ref-pnum">executed</span> him in front of a group of stunned Israeli soldiers. (Tubiansky would be the only person ever executed in Israel, beside Adolf Eichmann.)</p><p id="p122" class="text-indent">Inquiries into these incidents led investigators to the perpetrator: Big Isser.</p><p id="p123" class="text-indent">He had suspected Ali Kassem of being a double agent and had ordered his assassination.</p><p id="p124" class="text-indent">He had framed Abba Hushi. According to several investigators, Big Isser had a personal score to settle with Hushi. He might have succeeded if the main forger in the employ of the service, besieged by guilt, hadn’t <span class="ref-pnum">confessed</span> to his superiors that he had falsified the telegrams implicating Abba Hushi, under Be’eri’s direct orders.</p><p id="p125" class="text-indent">And Be’eri had also been the one who had ordered the hasty arrest and execution of Captain Tubiansky.</p><p id="p126" class="text-indent">Prime Minister Ben-Gurion acted immediately. Be’eri was tried in a military court, then in a civil one, stripped of his rank, dishonorably <span class="ref-pnum">discharged</span> from the IDF, and found guilty of the deaths of Ali Kassem and Meir Tubiansky.</p><p id="p127" class="text-indent">Israel’s leaders were flabbergasted. Be’eri’s methods seemed taken straight from the infamous KGB; his sinister personality, his orders to forge, torture, and murder were a stain on the moral and humane principles on which <span class="ref-pnum">Israel</span> had been founded.</p><p id="p128" class="text-indent">The Be’eri affair left a gruesome scar on the secret service and had a profound impact on its evolution. If, in wartime, the civil leaders had <span class="ref-pnum">recoiled</span> from condemning Be’eri, Israel’s secret service might have assumed a totally different character. It might well have become a KGB-like <span class="ref-pnum">organization</span> for whom the dark arts were routine practices. Instead, in the future, Be’eri’s methods would be forbidden. The secret service placed limits on its own power and based its future operations on legal and moral principles that would guarantee the rights of individuals.</p><p id="p129" class="text-indent">With the removal of Be’eri, another man stepped onto center stage of Israel’s shadow world, Be’eri’s polar opposite: Reuven Shiloah.</p><div class="decoration" id="decoration1"><p class="decoration-para" id="p130">* * *</p></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara9"><a id="pagebreak-rw_29"></a><span class="dropcap">R</span>euven Shiloah, forty, soft-spoken, secretive, was a man of mystery. He had come from a rich culture, possessed a sharp, analytical mind, an in-depth knowledge of the Arab Middle East, its tribal traditions, <span class="ref-pnum">ruling</span> clans, fleeting alliances, and blood feuds. One of his admirers called him “the queen in Ben-Gurion’s chess game” when he served as political adviser to the prime minister. Some compared him to the wily Cardinal Richelieu of France; others saw him as a subtle manipulator, a master <span class="ref-pnum">puppeteer</span>: a man who knew how to pull strings behind the scenes. Shiloah had been active, all his life, in secret missions and undercover work.</p><p id="p131" class="text-indent">The suave, urbane son of a rabbi, Shiloah had been born in Old <span class="ref-pnum">Jerusalem</span>. Always formally dressed, the trim, balding young man had set out on a mission to Baghdad, long before the creation of Israel. He had spent three years in Iraq, posing as a journalist and a teacher and studying that country’s politics. During World War II, he negotiated with the British to set up a Jewish Commando Corps to sabotage operations in Nazi-occupied Europe. He helped create two such special Jewish commando units: one was a German battalion equipped with German weapons and uniforms, which undertook daring missions behind enemy lines in Europe; the other was an Arab battalion whose members spoke Arabic, dressed like Arabs, and were trained for missions deep in Arab territory. He also convinced the British to parachute Jewish volunteers from Palestine into occupied Europe to organize local Jewish resistance to the Nazis. Shiloah was the first to establish contacts with the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), the <span class="ref-pnum">precursor</span> to the CIA. On the eve of Israel’s Independence War, he traveled to the neighboring Arab capitals in secret and brought back a priceless trophy: the Arab armies’ invasion plans.</p><p id="p132" class="text-indent">Shiloah’s compulsive need to act under a thick cloak of secrecy became the source of myriad legends. His friends used to joke that once he hailed a taxi. “Where to?” the driver asked. Shiloah answered: “It’s a state secret.”</p><p id="p133" class="text-indent">During the Independence War, Shiloah headed the external political information service. It was one of several quasi-independent intelligence groups created before the birth of Israel. But on December 13, 1949, <span class="ref-pnum">Ben-Gurion</span> issued an order to establish “an institute (in Hebrew, <em class="calibre7">mossad</em>) to <a id="pagebreak-rw_30"></a>coordinate state intelligence agencies,” to be headed by Reuven Shiloah.</p><p id="p134" class="text-indent">Yet it took two more years of delays and disputes before Mossad could be created. One intelligence unit, called the political department, whose members had been gathering intelligence abroad, enjoying generous <span class="ref-pnum">expense</span> accounts and a glamorous lifestyle, revolted and refused to continue spying for Israel when they heard of the plan to disband their unit and incorporate it into Mossad. Only after they were reprimanded—and most of them fired—could Shiloah create Mossad.</p><p id="p135" class="text-indent">Its title would eventually be changed to the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations, and its motto chosen from Proverbs 11:14: “<span class="ref-pnum">Without</span> stratagems would a people fall, and deliverance is in a wise counsel.”</p><p id="p136" class="text-indent">But neither the new title nor the motto made Mossad unique. Shiloah was determined to confer upon it an exceptional feature. Mossad would not only be the long arm of Israel, but also the long arm of the entire <span class="ref-pnum">Jewish</span> people. At a meeting of his first recruits, the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em> declared: “Beside all the functions of a secret service, we have another major task: to protect the Jewish people, wherever they are, and to organize their immigration to Israel.” And indeed, in the years following, Mossad would secretly help create self-defense units in places where Jewish communities were in peril: Cairo, Alexandria, Damascus, Baghdad, and some South American cities. Young militant Jews were surreptitiously brought to Israel and trained by the army and Mossad, weapons were smuggled into unstable or enemy countries and hidden, local Jews were organized into defense units to <span class="ref-pnum">create</span> forces able to defend the Jewish community from attacks by a mob or by irregular armed groups—at least until help came from government forces or international organizations.</p><p id="p137" class="text-indent">In the fifties, Mossad brought to Israel tens of thousands of imperiled Jews from the Arab countries in the Middle East and Morocco; and years later, in the eighties, it was again Mossad that organized the rescue of Jews trapped in Khomeini’s Iran and carried out the mass exodus of Ethiopia’s Jews to Israel. But during its first undercover operation in Iraq, disaster struck.</p><div class="decoration" id="decoration2"><p class="decoration-para" id="p138">* * *</p></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara10"><a id="pagebreak-rw_31"></a><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the large Baghdad department store Orosdi Back, on Rashid Street, a young man named Assad was manning a necktie counter. A Palestinian refugee, he had left his home in Acre after the Israeli army had captured that city. Shortly before leaving Israel, he had done a favor for his cousin who had fallen ill, by taking his place as a waiter in a café near the <span class="ref-pnum">military</span> governor’s compound. For a week, Assad had walked the corridors of the military governor’s building, carrying an ornate brass tray and <span class="ref-pnum">serving</span> tiny cups of strong Turkish coffee to Israeli army officers. The faces of some of those young officers stayed with him.</p><p id="p139" class="text-indent">On that day, May 22, 1951, he was observing the customers walking through the store, when he noticed a familiar face. It can’t be, he thought at first; it’s impossible! But he did remember the man he saw—not in <span class="ref-pnum">summer</span> shirt and pants, like today, but in a khaki uniform. Assad alerted the police. “I’ve seen an Israeli army officer! Right here in Baghdad!”</p><p id="p140" class="text-indent">The police promptly arrested the European-looking man, who was <span class="ref-pnum">accompanied</span> by a thin, nondescript, bespectacled Iraqi Jew. His name was Nissim Moshe, and he told the police that he was a mere civil servant at the Jewish Community Center. “I met this tourist yesterday at a concert,” he explained, “and he asked me to show him around the stores.” When they reached headquarters, the two men were separated. The Iraqi <span class="ref-pnum">detectives</span> brutally interrogated Moshe about the man who had been identified as Israeli. Moshe stuck to his story: he had met the tourist only yesterday, and didn’t know him. In the dark cellars of police headquarters, the <span class="ref-pnum">interrogators</span> strung up Moshe by his feet and then by his hands, beat him, and threatened to kill him. But their prisoner seemed to know nothing. After a week of torture, the Iraqis decided that Nissim Moshe was a nobody and released him.</p><p id="p141" class="text-indent">The other prisoner kept repeating he was an Iranian named Ismail <span class="ref-pnum">Salhun</span>, and he showed his captors his Iranian passport; but they <span class="ref-pnum">continued</span> torturing him. He didn’t look Iranian, and he didn’t speak a word of Persian. Finally, they set up a confrontation between him and Assad, the Palestinian who had identified him. “My blood froze in my veins when I saw him,” the prisoner said later. He broke down and confessed: he was <a id="pagebreak-rw_32"></a>Yehuda Taggar (Yudke Tadjer), an Israeli, a captain in the IDF. The <span class="ref-pnum">detectives</span> dragged him to his apartment, broke the furniture, probed the walls, and then discovered a cache of documents—a voluminous file taped to the bottom of a drawer in his desk.</p><p id="p142" class="text-indent">And the nightmare began. Not only for Taggar, but for the entire <span class="ref-pnum">Baghdad</span> Jewish community.</p><p id="p143" class="text-indent">Several clandestine Jewish and Israeli organizations operated in <span class="ref-pnum">Baghdad</span>, including an illegal emigration unit, a self-defense group, and a few Zionist and youth movements. Some had been created even before the birth of the State of Israel. Around Baghdad, in several caches, weapons and documents were stocked, some within the central Mas’uda Shemtov synagogue. The recent additions to these groups were a few espionage <span class="ref-pnum">networks</span>, hastily established prior to the creation of Mossad; <span class="ref-pnum">compartmentalization</span> was almost nonexistent, and the fall of one could easily bring down all the others. The Iraqi Jews sat on a powder keg: Iraq was the most dangerous enemy of the young State of Israel, and the only one that had refused to sign an armistice agreement with it. Every member of the secret Jewish networks knew that the Iraqis would show no mercy, and their lives would hang on a thread.</p><p id="p144" class="text-indent">For that reason, Yehuda Taggar had been sent there to detach the <span class="ref-pnum">espionage</span> network from all the others. A former officer in the Palmach elite forces, Taggar was twenty-seven and sported a rebel forelock and a ready smile. This was his first mission abroad, and prior to his capture he had done his best to isolate the network he led from the other groups, but some of his own men nonetheless still took part in other secret activities; another Israeli with a genuine British passport, Peter Yaniv (Rodney the Hindu), ran a separate network but remained in contact with Taggar.</p><p id="p145" class="text-indent">Taggar’s communications to Tel Aviv passed through the top <span class="ref-pnum">commander</span> of all the groups operating in Baghdad: a secretive man whose identity was known to few. His cover name was Zaki Haviv, but he was really Mordechai Ben-Porat, an Iraqi-born Israeli, a former officer during Israel’s Independence War. He had been loath to go back to Baghdad and was on the verge of getting married to a girl he had met in the army, but <span class="ref-pnum">finally</span> <a id="pagebreak-rw_33"></a>yielded to the pressure of the intelligence community and undertook this perilous mission.</p><p id="p146" class="text-indent">In the days following Taggar’s arrest, the entire secret organization crumbled. Iraqi special police units arrested scores of Jews. Some broke down under interrogation and led their captors to their hideouts. The Iraqis discovered documents that linked certain Jews to espionage. Under the flagstones of Shemtov synagogue, the police uncovered a huge cache of weapons, built up over the years, starting after a bloody pogrom in 1941 in which 179 Jews had been slaughtered, 2,118 wounded, and hundreds of women raped. The number of weapons found amazed the Iraqis: 436 grenades, 33 machine pistols, 186 revolvers, 97 machine-gun chargers, 32 commando daggers, and 25,000 cartridges.</p><p id="p147" class="text-indent">During the ferocious Iraqi interrogation, a name popped up more and more frequently: Zaki Haviv, the mysterious top man of the underground. But who was he? And where? Finally, a smart young detective made the connection: Zaki Haviv had to be none other than Nissim Moshe, the self-effacing fellow who had been arrested with Taggar and then released. Scores of agents raided Moshe’s house—but found nobody. A manhunt of epic proportions was conducted throughout Baghdad, but Zaki Haviv had vanished.</p><p id="p148" class="text-indent">Actually, he was in the one place the police hadn’t dreamt of searching. He was in jail.</p><p id="p149" class="text-indent">A couple of days after his release from the initial arrest with Taggar, Ben-Porat was awakened by a loud pounding on his door. “Open, police!” the agents were shouting. Ben-Porat thought that this was end. The house had no back exit, and there was no one in Baghdad who could save him now. And he knew, for a man in his position, there could be only one <span class="ref-pnum">verdict</span> in the Iraqi courts: the gallows. He resigned himself and unlocked the door. Two police officers were outside. “You are under arrest,” one said.</p><p id="p150" class="text-indent">Ben-Porat feigned surprise. “But what have I done?”</p><p id="p151" class="text-indent">“Oh, nothing serious,” the cop said, “just an automobile accident. Now, get dressed.”</p><p id="p152" class="text-indent">Ben-Porat couldn’t believe his ears. He had forgotten all about the <a id="pagebreak-rw_34"></a>accident in which he had been involved some months earlier. He had <span class="ref-pnum">ignored</span> the court summons, and now was going to face Iraqi justice. The trial was swift, barely an hour. The judge sentenced him to two weeks in jail. And so, while an army of Iraqi agents were on full alert, searching for him, Zaki Haviv was paying his debt to society in a Baghdad jail.</p><p id="p153" class="text-indent">Prior to his release two weeks later, Ben-Porat was being taken to <span class="ref-pnum">headquarters</span> to be fingerprinted and photographed. He knew that if that were to happen, he was doomed. They would then be able to identify him as Zaki Haviv, and this time it would not be a two-week sentence. He walked with his two guards along Baghdad’s streets to the headquarters, some <span class="ref-pnum">distance</span> away. En route they passed through the crowded Shurja souk, an exotic market crammed with tiny dark shops, merchants screaming the praise of their wares, and narrow, crooked alleys. At what he hoped was the right moment, Ben-Porat pushed his guards aside, dove into the crowd, and vanished. The cops didn’t even try to chase him. After all, he was due to be released in less than an hour, so why bother?</p><p id="p154" class="text-indent">But when they reported the incident, all hell broke loose. They had let Zaki Haviv, the most wanted man in Iraq, go! The opposition press found out and attacked the government’s ineptitude with screaming headlines. “Where is Haviv?” asked a newspaper, and answered: “Haviv—in Tel Aviv!”</p><p id="p155" class="text-indent">Back in Tel Aviv, Ben-Porat’s superiors meticulously prepared his escape from Iraq. While he hid at a friend’s house, the plan was put into action. At that time, a mammoth airlift was under way, bringing the entire Jewish community from Iraq to Israel, via Cyprus. About 100,000 Jews were <span class="ref-pnum">fleeing</span> Iraq, with planes taking off almost every night.</p><p id="p156" class="text-indent">On the night of June 12, Ben-Porat put on his best clothes and hailed a cab. His friends had drenched him with arrack—the local liquor—and, reeking of alcohol, he collapsed on the backseat of the taxi and feigned sleep. The driver helped his drunken fare out and into a back street near Baghdad airport, and left. Once alone, Ben-Porat hurried to the airport fence—he knew exactly where it had been cut—and slipped inside. On the tarmac, a plane had just finished loading its emigrants and was taxiing on the runway. Suddenly the pilot aimed his lights at the control tower, <a id="pagebreak-rw_35"></a>momentarily blinding the air controllers. The plane gathered speed, its rear door slid back, ten feet above ground, and a dangling rope appeared. Coming out of the dark, Ben-Porat darted toward the plane, grabbed the rope, and was hauled into the aircraft, which immediately took off. <span class="ref-pnum">Neither</span> ground crews nor passengers noticed this escape, which seemed taken straight from an action movie.</p><p id="p157" class="text-indent">As the plane passed over the city, its lights flashed on and off three times. “God be praised,” murmured a few men gathered on a rooftop. Their friend was safe and on his way.</p><p id="p158" class="text-indent">A few hours later, Haviv was indeed in Tel Aviv.</p><p id="p159" class="text-indent">He married his sweetheart, and in the years that followed turned to politics, became a member of parliament, a cabinet minister, and today is a venerated leader of the Iraqi Jews in Israel.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line5"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara11"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hose left behind were not so fortunate. Scores of Jews were arrested, beaten, and tortured. Taggar and twenty-one others were tried for <span class="ref-pnum">subversion</span>. Two prominent Baghdad Jews, Shalom Salach and Joseph Batzri, were accused of possessing explosives and weapons and sentenced to death.</p><p id="p160" class="text-indent">Shortly before his trial was to start, Taggar was awakened in the middle of the night, his cell full of policemen. “You are going to be hanged <span class="ref-pnum">tonight</span>,” the chief investigator announced.</p><p id="p161" class="text-indent">“But you can’t hang a man without trial!” Taggar protested.</p><p id="p162" class="text-indent">“Can’t we? We know all about you already, you’re an Israeli officer, you’re a spy—we don’t need anything more.”</p><p id="p163" class="text-indent">A bearded rabbi entered and sat beside Taggar, reading him Psalms. At three thirty in the morning, the officers took Taggar to the execution chamber. He walked between them, stunned. Only weeks ago he had been visiting his family in Jerusalem, then on his way here he had enjoyed the pleasures of Paris and Rome. And now he was going to dangle from the end of a rope.</p><p id="p164" class="text-indent">The Iraqis made him sign several forms—bureaucracy at work, even now—then the hangman took away his rings and watch. Taggar demanded that his body be sent to Israel. The hangman made him stand over a <span class="ref-pnum">trap-door</span> <a id="pagebreak-rw_36"></a>and tied sandbags to his feet. He was forced to turn his back to the hangman, who placed the noose round his neck and grabbed the handle controlling the trapdoor. Taggar rejected the black hood that they tried to pull over his head. The hangman now looked at his commanding officer, standing with several others in front of the man who was going to die. Taggar thought of his family, of his native Jerusalem, of the life he could have had. Will my neck be broken? he wondered, and felt an all-consuming dread take hold of his entire being.</p><p id="p165" class="text-indent">And then, all of a sudden, the officers left. Taggar was pulled back from the trapdoor. The scowling hangman removed the sandbags from his feet and the noose from his neck, muttering that he had lost his pay for <span class="ref-pnum">tonight</span>. Taggar realized, amazed, that he was not going to die! Everything, down to the smallest detail, had been a ruse. They had hoped to break him and make him reveal more details about his accomplices. But now, as he trudged back to his cell, still alive, Taggar was certain he wouldn’t die in an Iraqi prison. His friends would get him out of there.</p><p id="p166" class="text-indent">When the trial ended, he was sentenced to death, but his sentence was immediately commuted to life in prison. Batzri and Salach were hanged. They spent their last night on earth with Taggar, who tried to cheer them up.</p><p id="p167" class="text-indent">Then began for “Yudke” a Via Dolorosa that he somehow managed to survive. In the company of murderers, political prisoners, and sadistic <span class="ref-pnum">jailers</span> in several Iraqi prisons, he nevertheless believed that he wouldn’t die in captivity. One day he would be free!</p><p id="p168" class="text-indent">He had to wait nine years. In 1958, General Abdul Karim Kassem seized power in a coup and murdered the Iraqi prime minister and the royal <span class="ref-pnum">family</span>. Two years later, though, some of his closest aides concocted a plot to murder him (which they would do a few years later). Mossad learned of the plot, and the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em> immediately established contact with Kassem’s <span class="ref-pnum">loyalists</span>, and struck a deal: he would give them the names of the conspirators—for the freedom of Yehuda Taggar.</p><p id="p169" class="text-indent">Taggar was in his cell, when his jailers came with a change of khaki clothes. “Put that on!” they ordered. “You are going to Baghdad.”</p><p id="p170" class="text-indent">A police car took the stupefied Taggar to the royal palace. Several <a id="pagebreak-rw_37"></a>soldiers escorted him to a huge office. Behind an ornate desk sat a familiar figure—President Kassem himself. Taggar suddenly realized: they were <span class="ref-pnum">setting</span> him free! Kassem took his time studying the face of the Israeli. “Tell me,” he finally said, “if war were declared between Iraq and Israel, would you fight against us?”</p><p id="p171" class="text-indent">“When I am back in my own country,” Taggar answered, “I will do all I can to bring about understanding and peace between Israel and the Arab States. But if war should break out, I will fight for Israel, just as you have fought many times for your country.”</p><p id="p172" class="text-indent">Kassem must have liked this answer. He stood up. “When you get home,” he said, “tell your people that Iraq is an independent state now. We are not the lackeys of imperialism anymore.”</p><p id="p173" class="text-indent">From the palace, a car took Taggar to the airport. He still couldn’t believe what was happening. They put him on a plane to Beirut, then a flight to Nicosia, Cyprus, and finally he landed in Israel. At the airport, his friends and colleagues were waiting. They expected to meet a broken man, a human wreck—but the man who descended from the plane was the same vigorous, extroverted, smiling fellow whom they had last seen more than nine years ago. How did you make it, they asked.
