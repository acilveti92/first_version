				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Hold still.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘It bloody hurts!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Don’t be such a baby.’ Isabel stuck the tip of her tongue out as she concentrated on tying off the bandage she had used to cover Jack’s wound.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sweet Jesus!’ Jack hissed the oath as the tight binding sent a spasm of pain running up his arm.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Listen to you.’ Isabel shook her head in resignation, busying herself gathering up the cloths she had used to clean the wound. ‘I’ve never heard such fuss.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘My apologies, ma’am.’ Jack opened and closed his hand, testing its mobility. The pain was like a red-hot poker buried deep in his flesh, but his arm was usable. He had been lucky. Khan’s strength had been failing when the blow landed. Had it been driven with full force, Jack knew he could have lost his arm.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You should take better care of yourself.’ Isabel tried to sound light-hearted, but Jack could hear the strain in her voice. A smear of blood had dried on her cheek, the grotesque rouge dark against her pale skin.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">For the first time, Jack understood her father’s longing for her to live a normal life. She did not deserve to be surrounded by death. A girl her age should be worrying about what dress to wear to the ball, which young gentleman would receive the honour of being the first name on her dance card. She should not be forced to wallow in blood, bearing witness to the basest emotions of man.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You should go home, Izzy.’ He spoke softly.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel bit her lip. He saw the pain in the green eyes that had so captivated him, from the first moment he had seen her at Proudfoot’s gathering the night he had arrived in Bhundapur. She didn’t speak, but Jack caught the slightest nod of her head as she acknowledged his words.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He reached across with his good arm, entwining his fingers around hers. ‘You deserve so much more than this.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel shook her head, forcing down the shudder that ran through her body. ‘There, that’s your arm done.’ Her voice was cool. She slid her hand from his, gathering up the remnants of bandage before wiping clean the bloodstained scissors that she then slipped back into the front pocket of her smock. ‘How does it feel?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack lifted his arm, flexing the fingers to demonstrate the successful dressing of his wound. ‘It hurts, but it’s fine.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘It won’t stop you fighting?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked up sharply as he heard the ice in her voice. ‘No. It won’t stop me. It can’t.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So you can do your duty. You can go on killing.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack closed his eyes. Her bitterness hurt. When he opened them once more, she was staring at him. ‘Yes.’ He acknowledged her condemning words. ‘I’ll fight.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You frighten me, Jack.’ Isabel’s voice cracked. ‘And I am so tired of being scared.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The words were like barbs.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">She sniffed once before rising to her feet, brushing away the dirt that had stuck to her simple dress. The heavy tread of army boots prevented Jack from saying anything further, and he too eased himself upright, cradling his arm gingerly as he moved.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Begging your pardon, sir. I’m sorry to interrupt, but Major Proudfoot would like you both to join him.’ Colour Sergeant Hughes stood ramrod straight in the doorway, his eyes elevated as if embarrassed at spoiling the moment.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack smiled at the sergeant’s sensibilities. He couldn’t help thinking how he could have used a man like Hughes in the Crimea. ‘Thank you, Colour Sergeant.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘How’s the arm, sir?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Bearable. It could’ve been worse.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Indeed, sir. I was watching you.’ The colour sergeant spoke plainly. ‘You fought like the very devil.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Mr Lark is a fool, Colour Sergeant,’ Isabel interrupted. ‘He throws himself around like a schoolboy, thinking he cannot come to harm.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He’s an officer, ma’am. It’s what they do.’ Hughes offered the explanation as if it was all the answer that was needed. ‘The best of them, anyhow.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Yet Jack heard the censure in Isabel’s words. The enemy were at the walls and he would have to fight again if he was to do his duty. But he knew he was losing the girl who had saved him. Doing his duty came with a price.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack helped Isabel across the barricade, cherishing the thin smile she gave him in thanks. They had been ordered by Major Proudfoot to join the deputation that would answer the enemy’s summons to a parley.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A party of exhausted sepoys were checking the enemy bodies that littered the ground outside the barricade, doing their best to separate the living from the dead. There was no time for anything more; the dead would simply have to be left where they lay. They had at least cleared a path, so that Isabel and the cantonment’s officers would not have to walk on a carpet of bodies, although the ground under their feet was still soaked in blood, the pale dusty soil stained dark mulberry.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot was dressed in uniform, the first time Jack had seen him in the scarlet coat of a British officer. Ever the dandy, he had eschewed the regulation shako, preferring to wear in its place an old-fashioned bicorn topped with an enormous ostrich feather.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I hope the bastards are asking for permission to bugger off,’ Dutton growled as he walked at Jack’s side. ‘Beg your pardon, of course, Miss Youngsummers.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel looked across Jack and smiled sweetly. ‘I have spent too long with Jack to be shocked or offended by such words, Major Dutton. Have no fear for my sensibilities.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Major Proudfoot heard the words and laughed aloud. ‘You have a great deal to answer for, Jack.’ There was no trace of nervousness on his face. Clearly being summoned to a flag of truce on a bloodstained battlefield did not daunt the British political officer.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘As do you.’ Jack’s arm was hurting like the very devil, and his reply was belligerent.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot simply shrugged the barbed comment away. ‘I am glad the Maharajah demanded that you and Miss Youngsummers join our jolly gathering. It would have been so dull with just Dutton for company.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">They picked their way over the bloodstained ground beyond the north wall in silence. Jack wondered at the Maharajah’s summons. He felt the twist of nerves deep in his gut as he walked towards the man he had abandoned. Isabel’s presence only added to his disquiet, and he wondered what strange design the quixotic ruler of Sawadh was trying to conjure.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">As the two parties came together just fifty yards away from the defenders’ perimeter, Jack studied the three men who had called for the truce. He was not surprised to see the Maharajah; he could not imagine the ruler of Sawadh leaving the negotiations to anyone else. He was flanked by his son and by the grey-haired general Jack had met for the first time at the conference of war shortly before he and Isabel had fled.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sire.’ Proudfoot opened the conversation. ‘I truly regret it has come to this.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah’s face creased as he tried to contain his temper. ‘No. I don’t think you do. I think this suits you very well.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot looked suitably shocked at the accusation. ‘I cannot fathom why you would say that, sire. No man can wish for war.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah snorted before focusing on Jack. ‘So, my general now fights against me?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack had forgotten the force of the Maharajah’s personality. It was only as the man’s hard brown eyes fixed his own that he felt the first stirring of remorse. Until then, he had simply been carrying out his duty, doing what he knew best. Coming face to face with the Maharajah once again made him doubt the wisdom of his choice. ‘I had no option, sir.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">To his surprise, the Maharajah smiled. ‘I would not have expected anything else from you, Jack. You would have disappointed me had you betrayed the country of your birth. As much as I might wish you had chosen differently. I want you to know that I forgive you. I bear you no ill will.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack found it hard to swallow, and remained silent as the Maharajah turned to Isabel. ‘You should not be here on the field of battle, Miss Youngsummers.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Where else would I be, Your Highness?’ Isabel lifted her chin as she answered the Maharajah.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I would wish you were somewhere safe. I would ask you to consider coming back with me. I will personally vouch for your safety.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack saw the look of longing in Prince Abhishek’s eyes. Clearly the heir to the throne had his own desire for Isabel’s company.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I will not go.’ Isabel’s voice quavered as she replied, but her face betrayed her resolution.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah smiled at her conviction. ‘I did not expect a different answer, but I could not have lived with myself if I had not made the offer. Perhaps after this is over you will consider once again being my guest?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Major Dutton had endured enough of the opening flattery and gave Isabel no opportunity to reply. ‘Let us dispense with the pleasantries. What do you want?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah’s eyes were cold as he turned them on the English major. ‘What I want, Major Dutton, is for you to leave my land. I will stand by the terms of the treaty my father signed, but I will no longer tolerate your presence in my kingdom.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I’m afraid that really isn’t possible, sire.’ Proudfoot’s oiled tones reclaimed the conversation. ‘You must become accustomed to the idea that we will rule here when you are gone.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘And if I refuse?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Then we will rule here now.’ The oil was gone from Proudfoot’s voice. There was just steel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘In that case we have nothing more to discuss.’ The Maharajah’s face betrayed his anger. ‘I will allow an hour’s truce for removal of the wounded.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Four hours.’ Proudfoot smiled with false charm as he countered.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘One hour. My men will understand.’ The Maharajah’s voice was as hard as the rock that littered his land.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot pouted and opened his mouth to carry on the negotiation, but the Maharajah raised a hand to silence him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘There is nothing more to say. You have one hour and then you will die.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack saw the hard glare in the Maharajah’s eyes. He had seen this transformation before, the sudden switch from urbane gentleman to wolfish ruler.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah turned, showing his back to the British party. There was no more to be said.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">They had one hour. One hour to see to the wounded and prepare for the next assault. An assault they would have to repel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">One hour until they would have to fight or die.</p>
