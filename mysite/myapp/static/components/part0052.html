				<p id="toc_marker-50" class="toch-table-of-contents-main-head"><img class="image45" src="../images/00050.jpeg" alt="Chapterheads.pdf"/></p>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The alleyway stank. Without proper drainage, the townsfolk simply emptied their waste into the streets, which were left littered with the foul and the noxious, the noisome slicks just one of the pitfalls the unwary traveller faced in its barren streets.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack crouched in the shadows. He flexed his right hand, hissing at the painful spasm the motion sent searing up his arm. The surgeon had fixed him up, stitching together the tears in his flesh, but they had not had time to heal properly, the wounds still raw. His arm felt stiff and was prone to a dreadful cramp that rivalled the ache in his back, keeping him awake the previous night.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Not that he minded the lack of sleep. For he knew that if he closed his eyes, he would have to face the brutality of his nightmares. In his sleep, his carefully constructed mental barriers would break down and his mind would replay the battles he had fought. In the depths of the night he would see again the faces of the men he had killed, alongside the images of those he had lost.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He waited patiently in the dank alley. He could feel the stitches that held his wound together pulling as he flexed his hand. He had been lucky. Sarah’s pistol had lacked the power to kill him, even at such close range. If she had been armed with a modern revolver, Jack knew he would now be dead. He grimaced at the thought.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British expeditionary force had made its way back to the main encampment outside Bushire. It had taken them two days, the exhausted redcoats struggling through the torrential rain that had barely stopped falling since the last gunshots of the battle had died away. It was a battered and bedraggled column that arrived back at the camp, but the redcoats marched with pride, their victory going a long way to dull the weariness. They had achieved much, and now they could recuperate and gather their strength ready for the next phase of the campaign.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But not all the men who had fought on the battlefield at Khoosh-Ab would be left to enjoy the short peace. For Jack had to complete his bitter task quickly and without delay now that the army had returned. The canker had to be rooted out and destroyed before it could do any more harm.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He picked at the wall of the house that backed on to the grim alley. The mud was soft and friable and he used a fingernail to prise away a tiny white shell that had been buried deep within it. He rolled the shell between his fingers, using it to unlock the muscles in his hand, releasing a little of the tension that he could not shake.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He heard footsteps and straightened up, dropping the shell to the ground and easing back into the gloom, hiding his profile in the darkness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He watched as the figure carefully picked its way into the alley. The man he had summoned advanced cautiously, as if not trusting the shadows. It was exactly as Jack had planned.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sarah?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled. The man he had wanted to meet had taken the lure.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sarah, are you there?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack heard the tetchy note in the hissed challenge. He closed his eyes and inhaled as deeply as his wounds would allow, summoning the strength he would need. Ballard had not forgiven him for letting Sarah Draper go free. He had allowed Jack to put his wild scheme into practice, giving his subordinate a final opportunity to seek redemption.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stepped out of the shadows to stand in the meagre light that penetrated the gloom of the alleyway.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good evening, Commodore.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The figure stopped abruptly. It was too dark for Jack to see the reaction on the creased and weather-beaten face, so he walked forward, revealing himself fully to the man who had been tricked into the meeting in the middle of the night.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Expecting someone else?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone straightened up. ‘Captain Fenris.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The revolver was heavy in Jack’s left hand. ‘Sarah is not here. Your accomplice has fled the scene.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The naval officer smiled. ‘You tricked me into coming. And you come alone.’ He sighed. ‘That tells me you are here to kill me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook off the chill of the words. He had killed so many men, but never in cold blood. ‘You are a spy. You knew the risks.’ His voice was cold, emotionless. ‘You know the penalty.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone laughed. ‘Quite true, Jack.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack started. ‘How do you know my name?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It was in Ballard’s papers. I rather suspect he left your identity in his documents as some kind of safeguard. Just in case you decided to do him in.’ Fetherstone’s eyes never once left Jack’s face. He stared at him, watchful and calm. ‘So now he unleashes his killer.’ The naval officer shook his head, clearly affronted. ‘Perhaps I underestimated him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Perhaps you underestimated all of us.’ Jack lifted the revolver.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone saw the movement and straightened up; a final display of defiant courage. ‘I think not.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘A pity.’ Jack felt the stirrings of anger. ‘I think we could surprise you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone laughed, his scorn revealed. ‘You think the fact that you are a charlatan should surprise me. What a pathetic creature you are.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Better a fraud than a traitor.’ Jack reacted to the scorn.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You are a simple soul, Jack Lark. You cannot understand. You look at my actions and you see betrayal. Yet you know nothing. Nothing!’ For the first time, Fetherstone’s urbane charm cracked. ‘Do not presume that a man like you can understand a man like me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I understand a spy. I understand that men died as a result of your actions.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone shook his head. ‘You understand nothing. What are the lives of a few soldiers? If they didn’t die today, they would die tomorrow. They mean nothing.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They meant something to me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘How very touching, Jack. Is that what this is all about? Did I upset your fragile sensibilities? What an odd notion for a killer.’ Fetherstone took a step closer to Jack, his face stretched with urgency as he tried to explain his actions. ‘Can you truly not lift your gaze and see out of the gutter? You should try to think of a bigger world, one where the lives of a handful of redcoats mean little. Do you think Outram loses sleep over the men he lost? Do you think Wellington wept into his pillow thinking of the thousands who died carrying out his bloody orders?’ The naval officer spoke with passion now. The revolver was forgotten. ‘Great men cannot think of such things. They must do what they know to be right, and if there is a price to be paid, then so be it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Is that what you are? A great man?’ It was Jack’s turn to be scornful.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Perhaps. I don’t expect you to understand. You have not seen the world as I have, or watched all those misbegotten fools who are allowed to govern and command when they couldn’t even run a common whorehouse. We are a country that values the accident of birth over ability, and it is ruining us. These men fail us but are never held to account for their actions simply because they come from the right family. We are a nation of the blind. It is high time our eyes were opened.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And that is what you were doing? Opening our eyes?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We need to change, Jack.’ Fetherstone spoke with intensity. ‘Before it is too late. We need the best men to lead us, not just someone’s bloody son and heir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Men like you?’ Jack’s contempt was clear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes. Men like me. Men bold enough to challenge the status quo. Do you know how many times I have been passed over? How many times I have seen lesser men promoted? And why? Just because some damn admiral crooks his bloody finger, that’s why. Merit means nothing in our world. Intelligence is sneered at. Ability is mocked. All that bloody matters is what family you come from.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack heard the bitterness in Fetherstone’s words. And he understood. He knew what it was to be denied a future by virtue of a low birth. Much of what Fetherstone was saying came close to Jack’s own opinion of the world in which he served. But it was no excuse for betrayal. For Fetherstone was wrong. The lives of the men did matter. The redcoats might have marched with obedience, but they also marched with pride. They came from the lowest rungs of society, yet they were the ones prepared to fight and die for their country. For that they were owed so much more than their country deigned to give them. They did not deserve such scorn. They did not deserve death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You know you’ll hang, don’t you, Jack?’ The commodore spoke more quickly now, a little of his sangfroid melting as he saw his death approaching in the barrel of Jack’s unwavering gun. ‘It’s all in Ballard’s papers. When you have done what he requires, you’ll be hanged. He cannot allow you to live, do you really not see? It would be too messy. You would be a loose end. No intelligence officer likes loose ends.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack narrowed his eyes. He ignored the words, focusing his attention on the feel of the trigger beneath his finger.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Have you ever seen a man on the scaffold, Jack? I have. It’s a terrible sight. Most piss themselves. Their final sorry act on this earth: to soil themselves to the catcalls of the crowd. Can you imagine what it feels like? The scratch of the rope as it twists round your neck. That final rush of terror as the floor drops away and you fall.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack felt no emotion. He knew what he was and the future he faced. Fetherstone’s words meant nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Then you kick. You cannot help it.’ Fetherstone was speaking urgently now. ‘You jerk and you thrash like a floundering fish as the last of your breath chokes in your throat. And then you die.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He paused and looked at Jack, peering into the gloom to see if his words were having any effect.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And then you die,’ he repeated. ‘Alone.’ His voice rose in desperation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled. ‘But not yet.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He squeezed the trigger. The gun recoiled, the charge exploding under the hammer. The heavy bullet punched through Fetherstone’s skull, ending his life in a shower of blood and bone. His body crumpled to the ground like a child’s rag doll, arms and legs twisted, the life force snatched away.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stared at the body for a long time. He kept his arm extended, aiming the revolver at the man he had been sent to kill, just in case he showed a final flicker of life.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But Fetherstone was dead. Jack had done his job. He had killed the spy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You can come out now.’ He spoke into the shadows behind him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Major Ballard, commander of the intelligence department, emerged from the darkness to stand at Jack’s shoulder.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That was a good shot.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack grunted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard reached forward. His damaged arm was encased in a black silk sling and a thick bandage was wrapped around his midriff. His drawn features betrayed the pain of the twin wounds that he had received at the hand of Simon Montfort, yet still he managed to offer a thin-lipped smile. He clasped his free hand on to his subordinate’s shoulder. ‘It had to be done. I thank you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He shoved the revolver back into its holster and breathed out the lungful of air that he had been holding since he had fired the single, fatal shot.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He was lying. I hope you know that.’ Ballard patted Jack once before walking past him to stare at the corpse. ‘I have no plans to have you killed.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He’d better have been lying. I’d come back and haunt you. I’d scare you shitless.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard chuckled softly. ‘I’m going to miss you, Jack. Are you sure you won’t reconsider? We have only won the first battle. The campaign is not yet done. We will have more work to do, you and I.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook his head. ‘No. I’m done.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard nodded. He looked down at the pathetic remains of the spymaster. ‘Poor Fetherstone. I would never have believed that the old boy contained so much passion.’ He sighed with what appeared to be genuine sadness. ‘We will say he committed suicide. It is an ignoble end for a man like this.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Will anyone know the truth?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard furrowed his brow. ‘You and I.’ He paused, pondering the loose ends. ‘Outram, certainly, and we should not forget Mrs Draper.’ He shot Jack a disapproving glare but could not hold the expression for long. ‘That is all. His secret will die with him. It’s better that way.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded. He patted the heavy packet in the inside pocket of his hussar’s dolman. It was his reward, the final legacy of his campaign. He might not have been awarded the medals he deserved, the public laurels presented to those officers who had fought with bravery. But he had earned something infinitely more precious. Ballard had made him the gift as recompense for all he had done. It was a reward worth so much more than any tawdry piece of tin.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He walked forward and offered his hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard looked hard into his eyes. He slowly shook his head, as if unable to understand what he saw, before reaching forward and shaking Jack’s hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I rather think I will see you again, Jack Lark.’ He smiled as he made his farewell.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack laughed. He felt the shackles of his imposition fall away. ‘Not if I see you first.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He nodded once and walked past his former commander. He had done what he had been ordered to do. And now he was free.</p>
