			<div class="calibre1"></div><p id="_idParaDest-12" class="ct4"><a id="_idTextAnchor005" class="calibre3"></a>The Adventure of <br class="calibre4"/>the Honest Wife</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">My earliest relations with Mr. Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street were rendered much the more intriguing because I spent an inordinate amount of time—or more than I believe to be usual with fellow lodgers, for I know of no other men who reside with independent consulting detectives—deciphering which aspects of his peculiar character were innate and which adopted owing to his singular choice of profession. As with every individual, some of his tastes must have been bred from the cradle, while others surely were cultivated to grant him greater chance of success in his field.</p>
			<p class="bt">In no other arena did his attitude puzzle me so much as in his open aversion to the entire female gender, for in that particular respect Holmes is nothing less than a living contradiction. My friend is prepared to swear that no female is to be entirely trusted, and that the very finest examples of the sex are yet subject to flights of deception and caprice capable of driving any logician to distraction. He makes an abysmally poor misogynist, however. Holmes’s easygoing gentility in the presence of actual women seemed to belie his disdain for hypothetical ones, and during no adventure did the dichotomy more greatly bemuse me than that of the Treadwell scandal of March, 1882.</p>
			<p class="bt">I was at that time still suffering lingering symptoms from my Afghan service, which unfortunately had left me with an imperfectly mobile right shoulder and a mercurial nervous system. Peripheral noises, especially sudden ones, sent my heart racing, and I was the victim of myriad sharp aches and dull throbs which echoed the initial agony of the moment a bullet had pierced my flesh in that far-off country. Having passed a wretchedly poor night’s sleep, wakened thrice by the cataclysmic volleys of thunder which herald the advent of springtime in London, I lay stretched upon the settee half-dressed at seven in the morning with a book in my hand and the hearth blazing like a small bonfire, supposing that abandoning the field of battle would improve my spirits and determined to attempt to conquer slumber again the next evening.</p>
			<p class="bt">The scuff of a boot sole arrested my attention. I glanced up in some surprise when Sherlock Holmes entered the room neatly clad and fresh-faced, polishing a cuff link with his thumb. Seeing me, he paused, and then strode directly to his tobacco remnants of the day before, which he had recently commenced leaving out to dry upon the mantelpiece corner for some reason that I could not fathom and had hesitated to inquire over. He raised a genial black eyebrow in my direction.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whatever are you doing awake at this hour?” Holmes asked, pressing very unpalatable used shag into his pipe.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Is that what you’ve saved the plugs for?” I reflected with a faint hint of distaste. “I know we are neither of us disposed to be spendthrifts at the moment, but I’ve some ship’s on my desk just there. Help yourself, by all means.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He laughed merrily, shaking his head. “Thank you. However, it is not economy, but rather habit and inclination. I’ve a taste for intense flavor when it comes to smoking—the thicker the better. Does this bother you? Its concentration allows me to concentrate, if you follow me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am not sure I do, but no, I don’t mind in the slightest.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Capital. And why are you up with the sun, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am awake because I prefer to succeed at reading than to fail at resting. My shoulder doesn’t care for this weather, and neither do my nerves, come to that.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hardly surprising—it was dreadful last night. I confess I am myself a light sleeper and passed much of the time over a medical treatise regarding the effects of alcohol on blood coagulation.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You appear remarkably energetic.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Sleep has never been so prized a commodity for me as for most men. Were it not a necessity, I should forgo it altogether—think of all the profitable uses the time could be put to! Humankind could have advanced a full millennium beyond its present state of modernity by now, if beds were but taken out of the picture.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I wish I shared your sentiment, for it is eminently practical, but I confess I’d prefer to indulge in a restful night again.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He clucked sympathetically. “I can well imagine, Doctor. Nothing is so desirable as that which is denied us, after all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Finding that I was dangerously close to complaining rather than simply remarking, which was not palatable to me in the slightest, I changed the subject. “Are you finished with your researches, then? Isn’t this rather before your usual breakfast time as well?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I’ve an appointment with a client.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, I see. I’ll clear off, then, and leave you to it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Stay if you like,” Holmes said, sitting upon the arm of the sofa at my feet as he lit his eccentrically stuffed pipe. “Mr. Treadwell will be here within a quarter hour.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But I should not wish to be in your way.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, I shouldn’t wish you to be either, but that eventuality seems rather far-fetched, doesn’t it? And nothing lessens the effects of a bad night’s sleep like setting straight to work, I have found,” he added brightly.</p>
			<p class="bt">Having quickly discovered that, while detesting the banalities of polite society, Sherlock Holmes was considerably more tolerant of an audience for his remarkable conjuring tricks, I rose to my feet with much more energy than I had imagined I possessed. Why he had seemingly selected me for the task must have had to do with simple expediency—I was present, and too ill to work, and thus an ideal spectator—but I heartily welcomed the assignment, for both his methods and the cases to which he applied them were already endlessly fascinating to me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll just be a moment,” I said en route to my staircase.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’d never dream of starting without you,” said he, with a faint trace of amusement.</p>
			<p class="bt">After I had quickly shaved and donned more complete attire, I descended into the sitting room for the second time to discover Holmes already in the presence of his client. Mr. Treadwell was a formidable gentleman, not so tall as my friend but much broader in the torso, with an august tilt to his lip and a bullish brow below a sweep of blond hair which granted him a handsome, leonine appearance. While his abnormally dark eyes were intelligent, they also glittered with volatile annoyance. I did not think him a man it was safe to cross, idly wondering how many enemies he had left irreparably broken in his wake to have come by his fortune, for his attire was of the richest fabric and tailoring. He stood with his sandstone jaw cocked at an impatient angle above an emerald cravat, holding a heavy gold watch, which he snapped shut pointedly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Here we are. Mr. Lucien Treadwell, this is my friend and colleague Dr. John Watson,” Holmes announced with an aloof smile, ignoring the answering scowl on the face of his would-be employer. “Our party is now complete. He helps me in these matters, and you may rely as I do upon his invaluable assistance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">This level of praise from my reserved new friend was as gratifying as it was unexpected. “I’m sure I’ll do all I can to help, Mr. Treadwell.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“See that you do,” he huffed. “I am here to hire Sherlock Holmes, not an entire committee.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, well,” said Holmes soothingly, “you may consider his presence a bonus. I suggest we all sit down, and that you tell us with as much detail as possible what seems to be the trouble.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Lucien Treadwell visibly attempted to swallow his choler as we seated ourselves. “I need a hired detective,” he reported bluntly, “for a policeman would be less than useless in my situation. This matter is private, personal, and indeed has a direct effect upon my marriage. Therefore the fellow who gets to the bottom of it needs to be <span class="charoverride3">my </span>man to the marrow. That’s where you come in. I have heard that you are discreet, Mr. Holmes, and not overly expensive.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend disdained to react to this introductory speech, but I who was learning his habits could see the twitch of his jaw and the beginnings of a smile which could chill a room by twenty degrees.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You see, gentlemen,” Mr. Treadwell continued, his left hand worrying at the seam in his trouser leg, “I require evidence that my wife is having an affair.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good day to you, Mr. Treadwell,” Holmes said pleasantly, rising.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What sort of ludicrous game is this?” Mr. Treadwell bristled in shock.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have no desire to expend my valuable time learning the intricacies of your spouse’s leisure pursuits,” my friend returned acidly, gesturing at the door with his pipe. “While they doubtless are of interest to you, they are of the most profound uninterest to me, and no amount of money could cause me to see them in an attractive or intriguing light. Should you decide to persist in your course—and I have no means of dissuading you—I recommend you hire a detective.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What the devil do you call yourself, then, Mr. Holmes, if not a detective?” Mr. Treadwell sneered as he too pushed to his feet. “A simple gossipmonger, perhaps?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As a matter of fact, Mr. Sherlock Holmes is an independent consulting detective, the final recourse for those who wish to solve the unsolvable,” I put in. “If what you need is a paid spy, Mr. Treadwell, I would suggest you apply elsewhere.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes cast me a look of stark surprise commingled with far more open appreciation than was typical for him. Then he crossed his long arms emphatically and returned his attention to his would-be client. Mr. Treadwell, meanwhile, was fuming and empurpling simultaneously.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve never heard such rank trash in all my days! A detective who can’t be bothered to detect is worse than useless. Meanwhile, I’ve been driven nearly to distraction.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I <span class="charoverride3">detect,</span> as you put it, with tremendous frequency and skill,” Holmes drawled, his pipe perched at the edge of his mouth. “But I do not <span class="charoverride3">meddle,</span> and that is what you are proposing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Meddling, fiddlesticks. I require assistance, and you suppose you’re too good for my money! Well, you aren’t, Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“On the contrary. I suspect that I’ve been too good for better people’s money, as a matter of fact.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of all the confounded nerve! It’s preposterous—no, no, Mr. Holmes, I’ve been told by informed parties that you’re the best in your field, and I’ll have you yet, by God. I’m a man who gets what he wants.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes raised his brows in such an inimical fashion that most mortals would have quit the premises; but Mr. Treadwell stepped yet closer, the men’s eyes locking combatively.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What’s the issue, then, if not money? Pride, eh? You suppose the task is beneath you? Well, there’s your first mistake, Mr. Holmes. I’m presenting you with a <span class="charoverride3">real</span> problem, I tell you, a genuine <span class="charoverride3">case </span>to solve. There are clues. For instance, Alice has started keeping her letter box locked. What call could she have to do such a thing? I already check everything that comes through the post, so what can she have to hide?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I haven’t the slightest idea,” Holmes snapped, entirely exasperated. “If someone perused all of my correspondence, I should certainly take to locking it up myself. Meanwhile, one’s merely providing oneself with some privacy is no reason to suppose her in an illicit liaison.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Treadwell, whom I heartily disliked by this time, took a turn before the hearth, searing fiery tracks in our rug with his volcanic eyes. “Privacy has nothing to do with it! She’s up to no good, I tell you, but she’ll not make a fool of me. A man <span class="charoverride3">knows</span> when his way of life is threatened<span class="charoverride3">,</span> Mr. Holmes, and the smart man makes a stand to defend it. I’ll have her yet. Locking her letters away, going out and coming back with the paltriest excuses—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps she finds the company at home less than congenial,” I put in.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend emitted a quiet cough.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Moping about all the godforsaken afternoon—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Treadwell, I seem to recall that I have already wished you good day,” Holmes observed icily.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Claiming the jewelry I’ve bestowed to try to repair the rift between us is poisoned . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I beg your pardon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Alice’s jewelry,” Mr. Treadwell repeated, stopping before Holmes to grin in malicious triumph. “Ah, I see that’s netted you at last! My wife grows thinner and paler by the week, refusing all my overtures, and when I try to get it out of her that she’s pining away for love of another, she insists that my gifts to her have been somehow imbued with poison. Necklaces, earrings, bracelets, all of the finest quality, and she swears before high heaven I’ve laced them with something, which is obviously absurd. No, not absurd—downright impossible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is at the very least . . . interesting,” Holmes conceded reluctantly, setting his pipe down.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And this when I’ve been nothing but generous over her ceaseless melancholic fits! She won’t touch her baubles these last six months, even when we’re attending society balls and dinner parties, and whenever I force her to wear anything, she’s always visibly worse the next day. Sprawling about like an invalid, white as milk and mewling like a kitten. It’s an excuse, I tell you, a wild fantasy concocted to throw me off the true scent.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dr. Watson, how common to your knowledge are simple metal aversions?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you mean the unexplained sort along the lines of hay fever, which cause scarlet rash, pulmonary distress, and the like?” I questioned.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just so.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Common enough with cheap metals like nickel and so forth, but as for precious metals like gold or silver? I’ve never heard of a patient who reacted to either, nor come across such a case in any study.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s quicksilver eyes lost their focus as he stared past his would-be client, mechanically placing his hands in his pockets. This new information had produced a seismic shift in my friend’s mood. Meanwhile, I could hardly contain myself for agitation—whatever ailment plagued Mrs. Alice Treadwell, bullying her into wearing finery she imagined was somehow harmful to her health was the act of a blackguard and a boor.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Treadwell, was your wife fond of wearing her jewelry before she began locking her letter box?” This time, Holmes sounded genuinely intrigued.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why should I bother telling you if you’re too kid-gloved to touch the case?” the extraordinarily contrary Mr. Treadwell shot back in a mocking tone.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes, realizing that our caller was a more contumacious specimen than any we had previously encountered, shrugged his shoulders like a famous theatre critic being asked to sit through a penny concert. His disinterest was well thought of. I attempted likewise to affect an air of indifference, probably with poorer success, as I could imagine no finer pastime than that of thrashing Mr. Lucien Treadwell down our staircase.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I haven’t the time for this,” the detective remonstrated. “Your case has no features of interest whatsoever save in the aspect of your wife’s strange horror of her own jewelry, which frankly indicates to me that she <span class="charoverride3">isn’t </span>having an affair. What woman intent upon seducing a man would employ merely some of her visual charms and not all of them? But in any case, it doesn’t matter—I’ll have to speak with Mrs. Treadwell and look over the house if I am to be of any real use, and I’ve no intention of wasting my morning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Aha, so it is to be cash over principles after all! I thought as much. Would you call being paid twenty pounds for a trip to Hampstead a waste of your morning, Mr. Holmes? I am willing to pay so much in return for your services. Or have you really no skills in the detecting arena at all?”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend grumbled, and fished for his watch, and compared it with the time on the mantel clock as Mr. Treadwell glowered. I observed them, deeply discomfited.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, I suppose I could cancel an appointment or two. But this is really very awkward,” Holmes said with deliberate truculence, reaching for his hat. “Are you game for a visit to Hampstead, Watson?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s most incommodious.” My voice was equally dry. “But I’ll join you all the same.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Please procure a cab and await us below as we gather a few necessaries, Mr. Treadwell. We shan’t be a moment.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When our highly disagreeable visitor had started down the stairs, I plucked at my friend’s sleeve. “I am not enamored of Mr. Lucien Treadwell, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He tamped out his pipe with uncharacteristic force and a lip quirked significantly, as if imagining the object standing in for his client. “<span class="charoverride3">Fictio cedit veritati</span> so soon? The man is barely out the door.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely you concur.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have vastly preferred the company of no fewer than three murderers who spring to mind, one of whom also dabbled in arson. He is vile.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then you’ve no wish to accept his offer?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“God no, I should as soon shake hands with Mephistopheles.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“In that case, my dear Holmes, what interest could this wretched matter possibly hold for you other than the not insignificant sum of twenty pounds? I hope that you would never stoop to digging up sordid evidence of a lady’s dalliances.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not for any sum, as I stated. No, Mrs. Treadwell may be in danger.” The sleuth lowered his voice yet further. “I know her fears sound fantastical, but have you ever heard of aconitine poisoning?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Aghast, I gaped at him. “Good heavens, Holmes. Monkshood?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Precisely. It is a very long shot, but that tincture can penetrate the skin, as you may be aware.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your idea is horrifying. But even supposing this bizarre fixation of hers is based in truth, why should the scheming husband consult you—indeed, <span class="charoverride3">insist</span> upon your aid?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I never said her fixation was necessarily based in truth, but it could be, and that is enough cause for me to take interest. There may be forces at work here of which Mr. Treadwell is unaware, an enemy masked in silence and secrecy.” Donning his gloves, Holmes cast about for his keys.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course you are right. Though it is exceedingly unlikely that even the most potent preparation of monkshood could be made to adhere to metal in such a manner as to affect the wearer.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’m aware of the fact. Still, there are stranger things, et cetera.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I shook my head, slipping into my coat. “To think that you may accidentally have real need of me after all—Mrs. Treadwell could simply be the victim of some obscure nervous malady.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps. In any event, abandoning her gems by no means indicates an affair. Mr. Treadwell suggested that transgression only because he is both dull and mean. No, lacking any legitimately damning clues, we must commence our investigation believing her blameless in that regard.” My friend pressed his lips together and cocked his square chin at me, resembling a cat which has spied a dish of cream resting unguarded on a windowsill. “But her husband, despite his obnoxious manner, was telling us the truth, or at least the truth as he knew it; I should stake my reputation on that. Something foul is afoot.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And yet you believe Mrs. Treadwell to be an honest woman?” I pressed as I followed Holmes’s sharply angular form down our staircase.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t believe any woman honest,” he corrected me as we stepped into the clear early-spring light, turning to lock the door behind him. “They are all of them lying about <span class="charoverride3">something.</span> The question is, what is this one lying about?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, that is absolutely disgraceful.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, a great many truths are disgraceful.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I already knew better than to challenge such outrageous aspersions on the comprehensive whole of the female character, for trying to prove to Sherlock Holmes that something is <span class="charoverride3">not</span> the case is like trying to prevent water from pouring out of a sieve. Instead I stepped into the waiting cab, Holmes following after, and Mr. Treadwell called up to the driver an address on Prince of Wales Road. We set off, wheels echoing sharply against the paving stones in the swelling bustle of a mauve Westminster morning. Sparrows twittered on the dawn-illumined branches, and the sun gleamed in the vanishing puddles like the shards of a shattered decanter, but I could take no joy in these harbingers of finer weather—not when I pictured Mrs. Treadwell (a wisp-thin, ethereal creature in my imagination) donning an ornate diamond collar which bled poison into her cobalt veins, slowly destroying her.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Treadwell set the facts before us as we traveled, missing no opportunity to vex our spirits. He had been married for two years to Alice Treadwell, and their union apparently had once been a blissful match—he a wealthy and altogether ruthless banker, he boasted, and she the daintiest blossom upon the vine. However, six months previous, she had stopped leaving her letters lying about the house (the majority were from her sister, Rose, who resided alone in Brighton, and one or two other female companions) and taken to locking them in a carved teak box in her bedchamber. Mr. Treadwell was tempted to force the lock, but wished not to admit his grave suspicions in quite so obvious a manner, which notion Holmes applauded with seemingly perfect seriousness.</p>
			<p class="bt">Alice Treadwell had, around the same period, ceased wearing a necklace of rubies and pearls which had previously been a staple item, claiming she felt sick to her stomach every time she handled it—and following up this assertion by spending a day in bed in a ghastly state after having been compelled to wear it to a charity dinner. A bezel-set porcelain brooch depicting the ruins of the Roman Forum had also been abandoned, as well as a bracelet of finest scarlet rose-cut Bohemian garnets, and an exquisite die-stamped hair ornament covered in seed pearls. Piece by piece, her entire collection—including new items Mr. Treadwell brought home in an effort to lift her spirits—were banished to a safe despite the protests of her husband and the coaxing of her servants. When asked why she would not wear them, Mrs. Treadwell insisted that they must have been treated with some noxious compound, hinting strongly that only Mr. Treadwell could have cause to detest her so.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And do you?” Holmes interrupted blandly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course not.” Mr. Treadwell’s jaw jutted, and I thought I had been wrong to compare him to a lion—an alley tom would have been more accurate, all cocky swagger without gravitas. “She felt guilty, that was all. Guilt over her failure at running a household, guilt over comforting herself with another man, no doubt. God, the mere thought makes me ill, but I must steel myself to stay the course, since the pair of you are going to prove the latter conclusively.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Failure at running a household?” I repeated when Holmes looked as if this assessment of the task at hand was causing him physical anguish. “Has that particular shortcoming to do with the melancholy to which you referred?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Indeed, yes. Alice is periodically quite useless.” Mr. Treadwell made a dismissive clicking sound. “Many’s the time I tried to explain to her what a privilege it is to want for nothing, to oversee bounty instead of penury, but to no avail. It’s a good thing for Alice’s sake that she’s so comely and tractable, or she’d have nothing to recommend her at all—the flighty girl never attends to a word I say.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a shocking lapse,” Holmes said without inflection, and for the remainder of the journey, all three of us wisely held our tongues.</p>
			<p class="bt">We arrived at a costly townhouse of pure white stone, with cheerful white shutters and windows which sparkled like brilliants in the increasing glow of the ivory-hued easterly sun. Like its owner, it announced itself as rich without the need for gauche trappings, and I wondered whether in two years’ time Alice Treadwell had managed to put any stamp of her own upon the dwelling. Having myself not long previous escaped a dismal life at a featureless hotel in the Strand, having nothing to do and no one with whom to do it, I could not help feeling sympathy for any fellow creature in a similar state of metaphorical homelessness. In contrast, while 221B Baker Street was already as suffused with Sherlock Holmes as its atmosphere was with shag tobacco—a phrenology skull wearing a jaunty fez in the corner, letters pinned to the mantel with a jackknife, several delicate chemistry pipettes carefully thrust into the soil of a potted plant for safekeeping—it was wholly mine as well, littered with my books and journals and cigar ends.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes popped out of the cab as if propelled from a slingshot, and I followed suit as Mr. Treadwell paid the fare. The uneasiness which had plagued me only increased with proximity to our goal.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes,” I whispered, “I understand that we must see her, but we cannot intend to walk inside and announce ourselves as—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course not,” he replied stridently. “We are insurance assessors. Isn’t that right, Mr. Treadwell?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whatever you like, so long as you get some results,” Mr. Treadwell barked.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we entered the sitting room, we found a young and lovely woman reclined in an armchair, reading a volume of French poetry. My heart sank when I saw that I had been largely correct in my fanciful vision of Mrs. Alice Treadwell. Her hair was of a pale butter yellow, done up simply and shining in the golden lamplight, and her equally delicate face was quite bloodless save for the natural blush upon her lips. Upon further scrutiny, I wondered whether Holmes’s grotesquely far-fetched suggestion of monkshood poisoning might not be correct after all, for this was not the natural pallor of a life spent listlessly indoors, that unfortunate affliction which plagues too many of our well-bred young society ladies, but rather the chalky whiteness of ill health. I thought additionally that he had been right to reject the calumny of infidelity, for there was such a spiritual air about her that I could not imagine a duplicitous nature behind the translucent skin. Alice Treadwell was in every apparent sense a woman of statuesque beauty and refined sensibilities, and when she looked up at us in startlement, I loathed our duplicitous errand no matter how intrigued Holmes was by her aversion to gemstones or how justified we were in wanting to ascertain she was safe.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Who are these men, Lucien?” she inquired softly, rising and summoning a tired smile to her face.</p>
			<p class="bt">“A Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson, here to examine the house and make an offer on a new insurance policy,” he explained gruffly. “I see that you’ve been reading the morning away again, eh, Alice?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is not yet nine o’clock,” she replied, but her tone was as docile as a shadow.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are quite right to think it unconscionably early, Mrs. Treadwell, and I do beg your pardon over the interruption to your day,” Holmes apologized, extending his hand as if to a frightened forest creature. “We must have a brief look around your home in order to assess its size, study its moldings and finish work, and cast an eye over your furniture, but we wouldn’t dream of disturbing you personally. Won’t you excuse us so that we might leave you in peace all the more swiftly?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Be my guest,” she agreed through her evident confusion.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Treadwell, we shan’t require you either, in fact rely upon your absence to make an impartial report!” Holmes added, grasping me by the shoulder and steering me precipitately out. “We’ll just take some preliminary notes before rejoining you! This way, Watson; we passed the staircase as we came in.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Upon the instant we had regained the front hall and Holmes had smoothly shut the double doors in our wake, he pivoted to face me with a strange fire in his eyes that had not been present in the cab. For a moment, he looked almost angry, before his inscrutable features subsided into better-veiled agitation.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is not aconitine poisoning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No? But how can you be sure?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Two of the valuables she abandoned according to her husband, the brooch and the hair ornament, could not possibly have been in prolonged contact with her skin.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, as a doctor, I must report that she appears very ill ­indeed—did you note her flesh’s peculiar tone?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My eyesight is remarkably keen, thank you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, perhaps some credence must be given her ailment.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, she is not at all well; it is simply not the fault of aconitine poisoning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens, then what is the matter with her? And can it be related to her gems after all?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Her condition and her jewelry are certainly related if my hypothesis is correct. But in order to confirm my diagnosis, Doctor, we must needs search her dressing room. Quick march!”</p>
			<p class="bt">I hastened in the wake of Holmes’s feline tread up the richly carpeted staircase, my every instinct screaming that we were acting out of character for defenders of the fair sex. What sort of chivalry could possibly call for such skulking about? My friend, meanwhile, climbed with his head thrown back and his slim shoulders rippling with energy, hot on the trail of something entirely opaque to me. Finally, I could no longer keep silent.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, please tell me you’re not about to break into Mrs. Treadwell’s private letter box.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes stopped in mid-stride, pivoting on the banister rail. “Can you really suppose I would do such a thing?” he asked, sounding genuinely surprised.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’m sorry, but I don’t know quite what to suppose. Nor what we are doing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve a rather dark suspicion I need to clear up, Watson.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Regarding?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A very private matter.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“To do with that lovely woman’s faithfulness to her lout of a husband?” I demanded.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, there’s your mistake, Doctor,” he returned in a much cooler tone. “You suppose us to be investigating the wrong Treadwell.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I tried to question him over this bizarre pronouncement, but my friend silenced me with an emphatic wave of dismissal as we crossed into Mrs. Treadwell’s private bedchamber. Without an instant’s qualm he traversed the pretty room, artfully furnished and brightened with subtly rose-patterned wall hangings, examining all he saw at astonishing speed. The decorations provided a definitive answer to the query I had posed to myself outside—Mrs. Alice Treadwell had indeed carved out a space for herself, for here I glimpsed no trace of the curt braggart with whom we had just spent a long, weary hour. The thought comforted me briefly. I left off idle speculation, however, when Holmes dived for her vanity table, opening the various drawers, his pale fingers dextrously searching amongst hairpins and creams.</p>
			<p class="bt">After a few moments of eager search I could not call fumbling, so focused was it, he pulled out a small bottle. As he held it up to the light, the acute planes of his entire aquiline face darkened. The stifled fury I had but glimpsed downstairs was revealed when his teeth flashed; an instant later, the expression had vanished.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What is it, Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Theatrical concealer,” he answered. “A brand I’ve used myself. Confound it all! Pinpointing a single hornet in a swarming hive is simpler than making deductions based upon female habits. . . . But there is no blush in this drawer, and I can find no kohl either. That must account for something. Yes, yes, I fear there is no other explanation possible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“She wasn’t wearing kohl, or blush, or lip rouge,” I added, quite at sea. “Or not that I could tell. But we both thought her unnaturally waxen. Do you now hypothesize that this means of masking blemishes was to blame for her pallor, rather than disease?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, undoubtedly. This specific variety produces a porcelain-smooth finish but, lacking the warming effects of stage lights, can impart a masklike quality. I employed it to portray a consumptive, but that is a tale for another occasion.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So why then would a woman who is obviously not seeking to artificially enhance her beauty own a bottle of concealer in the first place?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very good, Watson,” he said approvingly, though his voice was grave. “Ah, there is the teak box in question, on the nightstand. Is that where she’s hidden it all, I wonder?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hidden <span class="charoverride3">what,</span> Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Treadwell!” my friend exclaimed, whirling round. His sharper ears had caught what mine had not: the sound of our client’s footsteps upon the sage green carpet at the threshold of the bedchamber door.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Confound it, I require <span class="charoverride3">immediate</span> satisfaction!” Mr. Treadwell hissed. “You are <span class="charoverride3">my </span>hirelings, do you understand me, and to take such liberties within my home—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We were just about to fetch you,” Sherlock Holmes replied, unperturbed. “I wonder if we might be allowed a glimpse of your wife’s neglected jewelry collection?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s here.” Mollified somewhat, Mr. Treadwell drew back a velvet curtain which skirted the bottom of a side table; he revealed a small safe and began working the combination. “Are you going to get that infernal letter box open and earn your twenty pounds, Mr. Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That may not prove necessary after all,” Holmes replied. Mr. Treadwell swung the thick door of the tiny safe open and my friend descended to one knee, lifting one or two radiant trinkets and holding them under a lamp. “And this is the entire inventory?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite a tidy fortune, eh? And for what, I ask you? A fat lot of good they do me when escorting a bare-necked girl who seems straight from the raw countryside whenever I attend a social event.” Mr. Treadwell scowled, passing a palm over his tawny hair. My friend seemed to have only cursory interest in the stones and their settings, for he passed them back and our churlish host locked the safe once more. “Come, be frank with me, I’m fattening your coffers enough. Now you’ve seen them, do you think my wife a liar, or do you suppose these precious trinkets poisoned?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Poisonous in nature, perhaps, but certainly not <span class="charoverride3">poisoned.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What in the name of the devil is that supposed to mean?” Mr. Treadwell snarled as both men rose to their full height.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It means that you’re in luck, and I’ve seen nearly everything I require,” Holmes trilled. “Might I prevail upon you to assist me in a small experiment which would prove my theory conclusively?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And just how am I meant to assist you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Is there a good fire built up in the sunroom opposite the parlor?”</p>
			<p class="bt">I confess I must have looked equally as confounded as our client when presented with this bizarre question. Fluidly, and with assurances that Mr. Treadwell must trust that my friend’s actions were absolutely essential, Holmes delivered his instructions. He and I were to interview Mrs. Treadwell in the parlor. Mr. Treadwell, meanwhile, was to find a set of rags to protect his hands, enter the sunroom, close the door behind him, and pull the damper tight shut, thereby stoking the flames into a fury. He was then to open the door, allowing the acrid plumes of smoke to flood the ground level.</p>
			<p class="bt">I had already seen perhaps a dozen people regard my friend Sherlock Holmes as if he was in dire necessity of a strait-waistcoat, but never with such conviction as Mr. Treadwell.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Allow me to explain, Mr. Treadwell,” Holmes expounded, tenting his fingers and tapping his thumbs against each other. “You asked whether I thought the jewels poisoned or your spouse a liar without entertaining a third possibility, and the one which I find the most likely by <span class="charoverride3">far.</span> Based upon the evidence to hand, I believe your wife to be a good and faithful woman who has the misfortune to be suffering from a virulent form of hysteria.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens!” he boomed. “Can it be?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am nearly beyond doubt it is so. When you correctly identified her symptoms, you mistakenly feared for her virtue when really, her brain was at fault. The inefficiency over household management, the depression, the irrational aversion to your tokens of affection, the morbid hypotheses—all this and more can be laid at the door of impending insanity. We must take swift action to save your wife, Mr. Treadwell. There is not a moment to be lost. Dr. Watson here is in complete agreement with me that the affliction is so far advanced, she is suffering from delusions, paranoia, and generalized mental degeneration.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I opened my mouth, but when the sole of Holmes’s boot pressed meaningfully into my shoe leather, I shut it again.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, no, it’s too terrible!” Mr. Treadwell exclaimed. “Oh, I can hardly credit the magnitude of my mistake. What a blunder I could have made! Dr. Watson, what a fortunate thing you were present to confirm Mr. Holmes’s diagnosis.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, aren’t you grateful he’s here?” Holmes insisted. “The good doctor has more than earned his keep this morning, if you want my opinion. He has proved invaluable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite so, and I’ll add ten pounds to your fee for it, gladly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I hardly think—” My mouth closed a second time when a renewed assault was made upon my toe.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But whatever can this fireplace scheme have to do with hysteria?” Mr. Treadwell questioned avidly.</p>
			<p class="bt">In a sweeping motion, Holmes indicated the surrounding townhouse. “When a woman believes her residence is aflame, she always races to retrieve her most valuable possession; but it is my belief that Mrs. Treadwell’s raving and disordered mind will instruct her to save something entirely worthless. This will prove hysteria beyond the shadow of a doubt. But you will see the concrete proof of my conjecture only if you agree to this experiment.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, if you should confirm it before my very eyes!” Mr. Treadwell gasped. “Little Alice hysterical, and I never noticed. What a relief! You’ve restored me with hope, I don’t mind telling you. It’s a hundredfold better than being made a cuckold of, gentlemen—not that I wish her sick, you understand. I’ll hire the best of specialists.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No doubt,” I said frigidly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Shall we, then?” Holmes suggested, gesturing toward the door.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we had hurried downstairs and Mr. Treadwell had vanished into the sunroom, I rounded on Holmes for the third time that day, determined to go no further.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mrs. Treadwell,” I pronounced softly but clearly, “is no more hysterical than I am. What on earth do you mean by all of this?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I mean possibly to save her life,” my friend hissed, wrapping his fingers about my wrist, and my breath caught when the fierce glow returned to his languid gaze. “If she imagines that her letter box is a safe hiding place, then she has made a grievous error—trust me, Dr. Watson, and do exactly as I say, I beg of you. I cannot state the matter urgently enough. If Mrs. Treadwell saves that letter box, I intend to devise an excuse to take it away from her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">It was not an unconflicted decision, for following Holmes’s imperious orders in the midst of a tempest was not yet second nature to me; but nevertheless I did trust him, and so—with mind awhirl—I accompanied him back into the parlor, where Mrs. Alice Treadwell had exchanged her book for her sewing box. She swept her queerly blanched face up to ours, smiling timidly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“We’ve nearly finished, but I wonder, madam, if you would be so good as to list any minor inconveniences about the house,” Holmes requested courteously. “Items such as leaks in the roof, a cracked kitchen flagstone—it would be an immense help to us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh . . . I can do my best. There have been repairs made twice to the kitchen stove, and Cook still isn’t satisfied with it. The shed in the back area is in a terrible state. We’ve thought of building a new one, but it never seemed to be the right time.”</p>
			<p class="bt">For several minutes, Mrs. Treadwell quietly listed household annoyances whilst Holmes and I listened attentively. Finally, when my already restless nerves were keyed to a positively tremulous pitch, I glanced behind me to see billows of smoke ballooning outward from the sunroom door. Mrs. Treadwell’s eyes followed mine.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Sweet God in heaven!” she gasped, leaping to her feet and spilling all the needlework scraps from her lap. “Help, gentlemen! Oh, do call for help!”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mrs. Treadwell flew like a loosed arrow up the stairs. At the same moment, her husband’s burly outline emerged from the ashen atmosphere; he was holding a kerchief over his face. His queer black eyes watched her go.</p>
			<p class="bt">“That’s not the look of a hysterical woman,” he growled, muffling a cough. “She seems devilishly determined.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Determined to save something of no value whatever!” Holmes volleyed over his shoulder, bounding up the stairs as we rushed after him. “Mark my words!”</p>
			<p class="bt">When we reached the landing, we were met with the sight of Mrs. Treadwell, her pale face white as cream and her hands clutching her skirts, wrapping a long hooded mantle of wine-colored velvet about herself as she dashed out of her bedroom. There was no letter box in her hands, I noted with a rush of relief, though why I should have been relieved I did not know.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s a false alarm, madam,” Holmes reported, holding out his palms reassuringly. “A harmless mistake about the damper in the sunroom fireplace.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thank God for that,” Mrs. Treadwell murmured, swaying upon her small feet.</p>
			<p class="bt">Quick as thinking, Holmes had her as lightly by the elbow as if she were composed of glass and was directing her back into her bedroom. He was gone only ten or twenty seconds and then appeared again, pulling the door shut behind, his spare bones galvanized like lightning rods and his deep-set grey eyes glittering mirrors in his chiseled face.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Can you imagine a better demonstration of a hysterical mind, Mr. Holmes?” cried Mr. Treadwell. “She runs to the very room where she might have saved her jewels, or even her confounded letter box, and she retrieves a cloak, of all things. A <span class="charoverride3">cloak,</span> when her house is burning. I am in your debt, sirs. Here is your thirty pounds, and gladly too.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes plucked the notes from his client’s hand. Without another word, leaving me to make a confused and hasty farewell, he walked directly down the stairs, out the front door, and into the road to stand in the brightening March light, waving down a passing hansom. I could do nothing, I had already learned in such predicaments, save follow him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes,” I said, when we were clattering in a fresh cab along Prince of Wales Road, “whatever just happened, I feel I have done you a disservice. Will you accept my apology? Though all was dark to me, I ought not to have doubted your motives, and you would never force open a lady’s letter box.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes had his index finger over his thin lips, his elbow propped against the cab’s window ledge. “I might, actually,” he granted with a smile confined solely to the left edge of his mouth, “but I should need a thousand times better a reason.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What on earth did all that signify? I understand nothing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But you sense the majority of it, I would wager. The main point was in the bottle of concealer hidden in the vanity drawer of a woman who wears no frivolous cosmetics. You may not have observed the very peculiar shadow at the edge of her jaw, but I am trained to see such things, even when I’ve no desire to. Her face was badly bruised, quite recently—and I do not imagine it will take you much consideration, Doctor, to pinpoint the man responsible, nor to marvel over the steps she takes to hide the foul liberties he visits upon her person.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The cowardly villain!” I cried, anger flooding my limbs. “When I think of that sweet, helpless young lady—why, I ought to horsewhip the scoundrel. Holmes, we cannot take his money and simply—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You have leapt to more than enough conclusions this morning, my dear fellow, though they were all of them justified,” Holmes interrupted me amiably. “I took the thirty pounds because that execrable cad’s wife isn’t having an affair and he thinks I proved it to him. I earned the money, did I not? Here is your tenner—no, no, you did your part, and I insist; not another word out of you. As for Mrs. Treadwell, she will doubtless tell us all about it herself whenever she slips out of the house and arrives at Baker Street, for I palmed her my card when I escorted her back to her room. She is to waste not an instant in coming to see us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">More relieved than I could say, I nodded. Folding the bank note, I continued to hesitate, staring at it, until Holmes fairly snorted and recrossed his legs in annoyance, pin-striped trousers flapping. It was a situation in which losing was preferable to winning, I concluded, and smiled reluctantly at him when I slipped it into my wallet.</p>
			<p class="bt">“So it seems that you were right from the start. She truly is an honest woman,” I mused, settling back against the seat.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Haven’t you been listening? There is no such thing,” Holmes retorted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I wanted to know <span class="charoverride3">why</span> she was lying because I strongly suspected that her husband—one of the less acute examples of the species yet produced, I think you’ll agree—was not apt enough to discern a very good paste copy of an item of jewelry from the genuine article. Of course she wouldn’t wear them in public any longer! The accusations of poison were simply an outrageous pretext, and a clever pretext at that, one she could supplement with careful applications of the concealer she already kept for use during her darkest domestic hours. Her husband had no idea what to make of any of it and wandered the halls of his own home frustrated and perplexed for half a year.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“She has been pawning her collection?” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“For these six months, yes. Do keep up, Watson! It was one thing to fool her spouse, but quite another to fool a room of eagle-eyed socialites. I can probably tell you ninety percent of the story, but let us instead await the arrival of Mrs. Treadwell herself, and the literal truth. Or as close as she’ll come to it, that is.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My mind was in such turmoil by this time that I was more than happy to allow a silence to fall between myself and my impossibly contradictory fellow lodger. We reached Baker Street in due time and climbed the stairs in companionable quiet, stoking the white-skinned coals in our sitting room and calling for tea. It had just arrived when there came a strident ringing, a hurried exchange of female voices, and a tripping patter upon the stairs. When the door burst open without a knock, Mrs. Alice Treadwell appeared, her breath coming in rapid gusts and an unnatural flush along her cheekbones. She wore the identical hooded mantle she had fled to rescue earlier that morning.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mrs. Treadwell, please sit down,” my friend hastened to say, leaping up and taking her elbow. “Watson, pour her some brandy, there’s a good fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mrs. Treadwell collapsed into the armchair which I had gradually been growing to think of as “mine” as I hurried to bring her a glass of spirits.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes,” she gasped. “So you are a detective. My husband has found me out, hasn’t he?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Treadwell has found out nothing, but I should be grateful to know the facts of the matter in order to satisfy my own curiosity.” My friend seated himself in his own chair while I took the settee. “Please do not feel as if you must speak of his foul treatment of you. We know your husband to be an unrepentant brute and hereby vow to do no further business with him save that which might serve to benefit yourself, madam—but what, if you will pardon my inquiring, took place six months ago?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Six months ago my parents, George and Mary Darlington, were taken from us,” Mrs. Treadwell replied weakly. “I mean to say, from my sister and me. I ought not to think of it as a blessing—it’s heathenish, altogether despicable. But my unmarried elder sister, Rose Darlington, who has always been my most kindred spirit, became a woman of independent means overnight. Lucien is so well off that naturally I myself inherited nothing despite my . . . unique situation.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A situation which I despise to witness, I assure you. The day this great nation grants women such as yourself the ready means to escape the clutches of monsters like Lucien Treadwell, I shall personally fund a parade through Piccadilly Circus.” Holmes’s voice was a light purr, but I could see that he meant every word.</p>
			<p class="bt">Her blush deepened. “May we both live to see it, Mr. Holmes. In any case, despite my having nothing of my own to offer in return, Rose pressed me in ardent language to flee from Lucien and take refuge with her. At the time, I was too frightened, I am ashamed to say. I locked that letter away, though I ought to have burned it. When Lucien tried to open the box and found it fastened, he was too proud to force the latch, but he took other measures—no, I do not desire your pity.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But neither did I desire my sister’s,” she continued, fiercely blinking away the tears, “and so I determined to have some money to present to her if we were to spend our lives together. I could not look myself in the glass otherwise. I . . . I stole out of the house and had my jewelry copied, selling each original as soon as the paste was finished, making up a ridiculous story about poison in the hopes my husband would think me too irrational to do battle with any longer. Every womanly means at my disposal I employed to avoid him in the meanwhile—headaches, fatigue, fainting spells, ennui. I meant to rebuild my life as Alice Darlington once more. No doubt you both think me contemptible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Actually,” I interjected warmly, “I think myself a fool for having doubted your innate resourcefulness.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And I think you as formidable an opponent as ever I have faced, madam, though I confess that I harbor hopes we may instead form an alliance,” Holmes announced gallantly.</p>
			<p class="bt">She attempted a smile which broke nearly as soon as it formed. “Dare I hope that you will not tell Lucien everything, then? What is it you want from me?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I only wish to know how much capital you’ve sewn into the lining of that cloak.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The lady’s fingers darted to her lips as she gasped. “I cannot imagine how you know that I . . . In any case, a considerable windfall. Nearly fifteen hundred pounds in notes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mrs. Treadwell—Darlington, rather; forgive me—you must depart immediately.” Holmes pulled down our Bradshaw. “There is a train to Brighton at two fourteen from Charing Cross. Do not wait for your wardrobe or your books or to bid farewell to your friends. Take your very important cloak and go directly to the train station from Baker Street. Ask Peterson, the commissionaire below, to accompany you, and I shall make certain he is paid for the journey. Come, your protests are quite useless, for I <span class="charoverride3">will </span>see that you are safely ensconced on that train. I wish you all the best of luck. And I do beg your pardon. Regarding the false fire, which was my doing, I was worried about the suspicions attached to your letter box and hoped there were no valuables within—but happily, you are still cannier than I had supposed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I cannot claim to understand you completely, but I am very grateful. Please, I <span class="charoverride3">must</span> reimburse you for your pains,” she whispered.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, no, I should not like to grow greedy,” said he, contentedly. “You see, I have already been paid twenty pounds.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The Darlington Substitution Scandal, as it came to be known a fortnight later when the entire truth came out in the society papers, was the pet freak of the popular press for no less than a full month. Mr. Treadwell, to our surprise and considerable amusement, stuck firmly by Holmes’s claim that his wife was hysterical; he further argued that no sane man stood a chance against the workings of feminine guile. When my friend, who could barely suffer to hear Mr. Treadwell’s name without a disgusted curl of his lip, half-tilted his head judiciously at this quotation, I was left to ponder the inexplicable dualities of human nature, a topic with which I am not fully reconciled even to this day.</p>
