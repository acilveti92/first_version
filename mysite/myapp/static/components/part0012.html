				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘To war? Why on earth do you want to go to war?’ Molly stamped her foot in frustration. ‘What’s wrong with going to the Indies?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, for starters, I don’t fancy puking my guts out every day for a year before they shove me in a box.’ Jack’s frustration matched Molly’s. He had come to deliver the momentous news only to find it had reached the garrison laundry before him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Who says it’s like that? I heard the sun shines every day. And there are servants, even for the likes of us. And you can swim in the sea that’s as warm as a bathtub!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You can’t even swim, you ninny. Who’s filled your head with all his nonsense?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s not nonsense. Mam says.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack snorted with laughter. ‘And what does she know? She’s never even been to London!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘She knew you lot were getting posted before you did, didn’t she?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘But that doesn’t mean she knows anything about life in the Indies.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Oh, and you do, I suppose.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I know a damn sight more than your mam.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’re just being your usual cantankerous self just to slight me. I’d do anything to get out of here. I want us to go.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Us? Since when do they send the laundry girls with the battalion?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They send wives!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’re not a wife.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And whose fault is that?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s not mine. Besides, even the wives get left behind.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Not all of them.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And I’d need permission.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Who said anything about you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do you have someone in mind then?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Maybe I do.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Oh, there’s others, is there? Can’t you keep your legs shut for more than a bloody second!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly’s arms had been strengthened by countless hours of dollying, stirring wet clothes with a heavy wooden paddle, and she delivered a punch any prizefighter would have been proud of, a rising blow that connected spectacularly with Jack’s chin. With teeth-juddering force, his jaws snapped together, his head knocked sideways by the force of the blow, and he staggered back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t you dare talk to me like that! I’m not some common doxy. If you think so badly of me, what on earth are you doing here?’ Molly stepped closer. She looked ready to continue her assault.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack lifted his hands to ward off further blows. ‘What do you want, Molly?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack saw the anger leave her eyes. It was replaced by a look of such sadness and longing that he forgot the pain of her right hook and took her in his arms, pressing her close.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They stood in silence for a moment, quiet in each other’s embrace.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What I want . . .’ Molly sounded uncertain as she began to speak. ‘What I want is a future, one that doesn’t mean spending my years toiling away in a laundry. I want a different life.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s not that simple, is it? Wanting is one thing. Getting is another.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I know that, Jack. I’m not a fool. But don’t you ever feel trapped? Stuck in a life not of your choosing but which has wrapped itself around you so tightly that you can never get out. I know I do.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack kept quiet. Molly could have been expressing his own feelings. He knew exactly what it was to feel trapped. It had taken him years to pluck up the courage to leave his mother and take the Queen’s shilling. All in an attempt to better himself, to find a life far away from the one into which he had been born.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So are you going to take me away? Like one of those knights in those stories my mam told me when I was a girl.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack laughed at the image. ‘I’m no knight in shining armour. I can’t even ride a bloody horse.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘But will you? Will you take me away? I’d follow you anywhere if it meant leaving this behind.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘If I ever get the chance, I will.’ Jack pulled Molly tight against him. ‘I promise.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘You wanted to see me, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I did indeed. Give me a moment.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames turned back to his desk, his attention focused on a thick pile of documents. The thick, creamy parchment looked official and Jack did his best to peer past his officer’s shoulder and read the neat, copperplate writing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was a fortnight since the momentous news that the battalion was to be posted had broken. Two weeks for the battalion’s mood to go from high excitement to sombre contemplation as the reality of moving to the far reaches of the empire left the redcoats wondering what their new future would be like. After so long on garrison duties, they had put down strong ties with the local community, ties that would be brutally severed when the battalion marched through the barrack gates for the last time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The spring sunshine spread across the desk. It warmed the dreary room, the soft yellow light meandering over the stained, peeling wallpaper that had once been deep red but now looked blotchy and discoloured. Sloames had obviously been working on these papers for some time; his fingers were stained with blue ink. With a flourish, he scratched his name on the uppermost paper and threw his steel pen to one side. The rickety chair he used at his desk creaked loudly as he twisted round to face his orderly once again</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There, it is done.’ Sloames stood, brandishing the paper he had just signed, waving it imperiously under Jack’s nose. Sloames seemed well satisfied with his work; he smiled widely and brushed his wayward hair from his face, oblivious of the inky streak he left on his forehead.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Dressed in civilian clothes and with the warm sunlight playing on the red and yellows in his brightly coloured waistcoat, Sloames looked much younger than he did when encased in the scarlet shell of an officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It, my dear Lark, is our ticket out of here. This beautiful missive is the final document that confirms that I am to purchase a captaincy in the King’s Royal Fusiliers! Fusiliers, Lark! We are to be fusiliers!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Us, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course. I told you I couldn’t do without your services. We shall face this new adventure together. I shan’t know a soul in the new regiment so it will good to have a familiar face around.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack took a moment to digest Sloames’s sudden announcement. He felt an absurd surge of pride that Sloames had made the effort to arrange to take him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I shall have to go to London for a few days to finalise the affair with the agent handling the transaction. I’ve hired a coach and driver to collect us tomorrow morning.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Very good, sir. I’ll start preparing your things.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That is not all.’ Sloames brushed past his servant, the small sitting room not allowing for easy movement when two people occupied it. ‘Have you heard of the events unravelling in the East?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘A little. Something about the Russians and the Ottomans.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You have it exactly. For too long, Tsar Nicolas has been trying to exert pressure on the Ottomans with an eye to increasing Russian influence on their southern borders. Ever since that shameful episode at Sinope when those Russian blackguards massacred those poor Turkish sailors, the papers have been calling for something to be done. And I for one am in full agreement! Even as we speak, Lord Raglan is putting his command to readiness and I have it on good authority that the King’s Royal Fusiliers are to be a part of his force. They expect to sail shortly and although I shall not be there to join them before they are despatched, I expect to be able to follow them without much delay. Indeed, time is of the essence. I would not have anyone say we dallied and I am keen for us to arrive and take command of my new company before the campaign starts properly.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘But the government hasn’t declared war yet, has it, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, it hasn’t, but the papers have been demanding nothing less for months and I fully expect war to be declared before the end of the month. The Turks and the Russians have been battering at each other for an age now so the stage is set for us to remind the world that the British army is still to be feared, even if we are to be allied with the damned French.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Doesn’t that strike you as queer, sir? Us fighting alongside the Crapauds.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It is war.’ Sloames looked suitably grave, an expression at odds with his obvious excitement about his new commission. ‘It is not pleasant but I am sure the government knows what it is about. If I am ordered to fight alongside the French then I shall do so with pride. My own misgivings cannot be placed above the needs of the country.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded in agreement, doing his best to match his officer’s gravity. It shamed him that he did not know more about the situation that would soon lead his country to declare war. He had free access to Sloames’s newspapers but had never bothered to take the trouble to read them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So where will we be sent exactly, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Here, let me show you.’ Sloames reached for that day’s paper which was on his desk. ‘<span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">The Times</span> has an excellent representation. Yes, here it is.’ Sloames folded the paper so that a half-page map appeared uppermost. He made space on his desk’s blotter and smoothed <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">The</span> <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Times</span> flat. Jack moved forward and leant over his officer’s shoulder to see. The two men shared a moment’s companionable silence as they gave the map their fullest attention.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Here is Moldova.’ Sloames’s finger moved over the map. ‘The Russians invaded back in June last year. This here is Wallachia. The Turks have been fighting the Russians in these parts since October. It is a nasty business but if the reports are to be believed, the Turks have given the Russians a bloody nose or two. As yet it is not clear where our army is to find work but I would not be surprised if we were to join the Turkish army here, near the Danubian principalities. However, there is some pressure for us to do something a little more dramatic and some observers are calling for a campaign here on the Crimean Peninsular with a view to seizing the Russian naval port at Sevastopol. That would make Tsar Nicolas sit up and take note.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack listened to the exotic names and tried to work out exactly where these strange foreign places might be in relation to England. His knowledge of geography was scant, to say the least. As Sloames spoke of the protracted series of events that had led Britain to contemplate going to war for the first time in nearly forty years, Jack did his best to read the article that accompanied the simple map. He was so engrossed that he didn’t notice that Sloames had stopped talking and was staring at him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You find this interesting, don’t you, Lark?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack pulled himself upright and took a respectful step away from the desk. For a few minutes the social gulf between the two men had been bridged by their shared interest in the wider events of the world.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Jack’s use of the honorific broke the spell, re-establishing their respective ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You may take the paper with you, if you wish. I have read enough for today. I didn’t know you could read, Lark.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘My mother taught me. I don’t get much chance to practise though so I’m a little slow.’ The admission brought back some of their earlier closeness and Sloames handed the newspaper over with pleasure.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Here, take it. I would be perfectly content if you were to take the daily paper with you at the end of the day. <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">The</span> <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Times</span> is a little long-winded but at least you will learn something of the campaign we are shortly to join.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded his thanks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To go on campaign with Sloames was everything Jack had ever dreamt of since he had first taken the Queen’s shilling. But it would mean leaving Molly.</p>
