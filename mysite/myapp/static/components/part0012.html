				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Reverend, our new captain.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot’s introductions had got shorter as he promenaded his new subordinate around the room, his sentences eroding as rapidly as his enthusiasm. For Jack, the procession of introductions had passed by in a blur of names, firm handshakes and meaningless nothings. The station at Bhundapur was small, little more than an outpost of the British Empire, yet it still boasted half a dozen commissioned officers from the Honourable East India Company, with at least that number again of civil appointees, along with their associated wives and relations.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack had now gained some knowledge of the people with whom he would live in the coming months. It would take much longer to understand and follow the complex web of power that would govern life in the cantonment. His short time in India had taught him that social standing was guarded as jealously as a maharajah’s treasure. To commit a social faux pas, however unintentional, was to court disgrace. Not for the first time he wondered at the sanity of his decision to force himself into a world in which he did not belong.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I am delighted to meet you, Captain. Now tell me. Are you bass, baritone or has the good Lord finally delivered me a tenor?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Don’t start bothering Danbury with your choir already, Reverend. The poor fellow has only just arrived.’ Proudfoot’s disdain for the portly chaplain was painfully obvious in his icy manner. ‘Now, Danbury. I’ll leave you with Reverend Youngsummers.’ The major was keen to be away and Jack was glad to see him go. Being paraded around the room like a prize heifer had been uncomfortable enough, and he did not think he would have been able to stand Proudfoot’s tugging on his elbow for another minute without his temper snapping.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Reverend Youngsummers gently patted his ample stomach as Proudfoot made his excuses, a soft belch escaping a wide, fleshy mouth that gave him an unfavourable comparison with a toad. The clergyman’s aged black jacket strained at the buttons as it struggled to encompass his bulk, its thick shoulders and wide collar liberally covered with flakes of fallen scurf.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You’ve no drink.’ Youngsummers’ disapproval was clear. ‘Let me remedy that tragedy.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He lifted his left hand, clicking his fingers towards one of the many serving staff standing like statues against the walls, then pointed to his own empty glass and raised two fingers. In the time it took him to turn back to face Jack, two fresh glasses of brandy and soda arrived in the hands of the servant charged with supplying this corner of the room with a ready supply of alcohol.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘There you go, a quick peg before dinner. Proudfoot may lack taste, but he keeps a good table and a tolerable cellar. You will find, Danbury, that one needs a good diet in this infernal heat. It is the only way to survive.’ Youngsummers’ eyes narrowed in anticipation at the thought of food. From his sizeable girth it was clear that the chaplain enthusiastically followed his own advice.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I shall do my best,’ Jack replied, trying not to smile at the odd creature in front of him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Youngsummers raised his glass to his mouth and drained it in two huge gulps. ‘I should introduce you to my daughter.’ He turned to bring a slight, blonde-haired girl into the conversation, careless of the trickle of brandy that crept from the corner of his mouth to stain the once white dog collar that was fighting to remain fixed round his bulbous neck.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Isabel, this is Danbury, the 24th’s new captain.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The girl who had caught Jack’s eye when he first entered the room now stood in front of him, offering a brief curtsy before fixing him with the same mocking, mischievous green eyes. Jack’s weariness left him in a heartbeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Captain Danbury.’ Isabel had to lift her chin high to maintain eye contact. She was slimmer than Jack had imaged from his single glimpse of her. The simple green dress she wore shimmered in the candlelight, matching both the colour and the sparkle in her eyes. She was captivating.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Isabel has come to visit me before going to live with her aunt in Truro. I selfishly wanted her all to myself one last time.’ Reverend Youngsummers looked at his daughter fondly, reaching out to pat her gloved hand with affection.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Now, Papa. You know full well that we have not yet fixed my plans.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack watched as he saw the full weight of Isabel’s charm brought to bear on her father. If Reverend Youngsummers had the willpower to send his daughter back to England, then he was a better man than Jack was.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘We shall see, my dear. We shall see. Do you have family, Danbury?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No, sir. I am quite alone in the world.’ Jack was doing his best not to stare. Isabel was beautiful. He could see now that her hair was redder than he had first thought, a touch of ginger amidst the blonde curls that were artfully styled in what he supposed was the latest fashion.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Then you cannot know a father’s pain.’ Youngsummers frowned as he saw that the new captain was clearly charmed by his daughter. ‘You desire nothing more than for your precious child to remain with you always, yet you know you must let them go if they are to live the life you desire for them.’ He spoke wistfully, careless of revealing his emotions to a stranger.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Perhaps Captain Danbury will know that one day, Papa.’ Isabel ignored her father, focusing all her charm on the new officer, who blushed at her attention. ‘He is much too young to be thinking of making a family.’ She gave Jack a teasing smile, making the most oblique reference to procreation sound like an invitation to dive into the nearest bedroom.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I am not so young.’ Isabel was so vibrant that Jack could not resist studying her face as he addressed her. It was a delight, her features slim and elegant, yet it was her hair that charmed him the most, with its unruly curls that fanned around her face. She had tried to tame the wildest sections with narrow metal clips, each decorated with a single glass bead that encompassed every hue in the rainbow. In the gentle light of the room they flickered as her head moved, a vivid kaleidoscope of vibrant colour.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Nonsense. Why, you cannot be more than two and twenty,’ Isabel mocked, her eyes narrowing provocatively as she estimated his age.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel’s beauty had transported Jack into his past, his mind returning to the memory of another young woman. It had been many months, but the pain of her death was still fresh.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel pouted at his lack of reaction. ‘There, I have offended you by speaking of age.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Now, my dear. I very much doubt if Captain Danbury would be so easily put out. Is that not so, Danbury?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack had to force his mind back to the present. ‘Indeed.’ He heard the coldness in his own voice and saw Isabel purse her lips as though considering something.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Perhaps Captain Danbury would like to join us on our expedition the day after tomorrow, Papa. It would allow us to get to know him better, before Major Proudfoot buries him in work.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘A capital notion.’ Youngsummers signalled for another drink as he approved his daughter’s suggestion. ‘Danbury, we have a long-awaited opportunity to visit a local wonder. Isabel likes nothing better than a chance to explore some of the crumbling, dusty edifices that seem to appeal to the local peasants. She has a rum idea of it being a fitting occupation for a young woman. I expect she gets that from her mother, my late wife.’ His mouth turned down at the corners, as if he tasted something sour. He gulped at his fresh drink, which had been brought by the willing servant, using the brandy and soda to scour the bitterness from his mouth.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I believe I noticed the tower you speak of on my way here.’ Jack tried to sound gracious as he attempted to make good his escape. As pleasing as it would be to have a day out with the delightful Isabel, he would rather rub his arse with a brick before he spent time with her father. ‘I would dearly like the chance to explore it, but I am not sure that will be possible for the moment. I must attend to my new command.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I’m sure Proudfoot would see the benefit.’ Youngsummers used his hand to stifle another deep belch. ‘And as you will discover, Danbury, my daughter tends to get what she desires. I doubt even Proudfoot has the wherewithal to gainsay her.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel’s eyes flushed with triumph. ‘There. It is settled. You shall come.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Who will go where?’ Their conversation was interrupted by the urbane tones of an English officer. ‘Am I missing out on the social outing of the season?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Arthur! We are merely inviting Captain Danbury to join us on our excursion to the mysterious tower of silence that I have told you about countless times.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Lucky fellow.’ The officer turned so that he was face to face with Jack. ‘So you’re Danbury. I’m pleased to meet you. I’m Arthur Fenris.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked into the face of his subordinate, taking in the cool, mocking stare. Fenris was far too comfortable for a lieutenant meeting his captain for the first time, and Jack wondered what licence the man had been given as he awaited his new commander.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Believing his introduction to be complete, Fenris turned his charisma back on Isabel. ‘So when was I to be invited?’ His playful tone made it clear there was no censure intended by the rebuke. As he spoke, Fenris angled his body, subtly but effectively pushing Jack to the fringe of the conversation.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Don’t be a ninny, Arthur. Of course you’re invited.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well I’m not certain I wish to accompany you now,’ Fenris teased. ‘You will have no need of two heroes to guard you.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘A lady can never have enough heroes,’ Isabel lifted her chin in what Jack believed was a gesture of defiance. It was clear the Reverend’s daughter was used to getting her own way.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isolated on the periphery of the conversation, Jack had a moment to study his new subaltern. Lieutenant Fenris had the build and stature of a hunter. He was taller than Jack, with the broad shoulders and narrow waist of someone who valued their appearance and took measures to maintain it. With an unruly mop of black hair and a pair of thick mutton-chop whiskers, it was easy to understand why Isabel was so clearly entranced.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">If his physique were not enough, then Fenris’ choice of dress would turn many a maiden’s head. He wore a long jacket of cream linen that hung to his thighs, coupled with a pair of tight-cut trousers in the same fabric. The plainness of the suit contrasted with his bright blue waistcoat, decorated with fabulous swirls and stitching picked out in bronze thread. Around the neck of his white linen shirt he wore a cravat of plain gold, held in place with a single pin topped with a fat pearl. Every cantonment had its dandy, and it was clear that Jack’s subaltern relished the role at Bhundapur.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So what of it, Danbury? Shall we both squire Miss Youngsummers?’ Fenris spoke in jocular tones, yet it did not endear him to Jack. He was not alone in finding the presence of the young lieutenant grating, and Reverend Youngsummers politely excused himself from the conversation as he continued his pursuit of exhausting Proudfoot’s supply of brandy.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I shall go but you shall stay here,’ said Jack, irritated by Fenris’ peremptory manner. ‘I would not want to leave the men without either of their officers.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I beg your pardon?’ There was a flash of anger in the younger officer’s eyes as his new captain pulled rank.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘If we are to get along, I suggest you see the surgeon and get your ears cleaned out. Tomorrow I plan to inspect the men before we conduct a morning of drill followed by an afternoon at musket practice. I want to see how well they can shoot. I would be grateful if you could make the necessary arrangements.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris looked as if he had swallowed a turd. ‘Are those your orders, sir?’ He appeared to gag on the title, as if speaking the word caused him physical pain. Isabel inched closer, her eyes sparkling with enjoyment at the tension between the two men.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘They are. What is the name of the senior sergeant?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘That would be Colour Sergeant Hughes, sir,’ Fenris replied with a healthy dollop of sarcasm.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Please let him know I shall want to see him first thing in the morning.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Have you cleared this with Major Proudfoot?’ Fenris sneered as he spoke, his anger at being so openly treated as a subordinate obvious.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt his own anger flare. ‘I do not need the permission of the major to run my command as I see fit. Do not presume to question me again, is that clear?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris opened his mouth as if to argue further. He controlled himself with some difficulty. ‘Abundantly clear, sir.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt the need for fresh air. Despite Proudfoot’s thermantidotes the room felt stuffy, and the perfume-rich air caught in his throat. With the briefest of nods, he excused himself and made for the door.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The smirk he glimpsed on Isabel’s face did nothing to improve his mood. He had not given Fenris a dressing-down for her benefit. Jack would get his command into shape, and if that required upsetting his callow prig of a lieutenant, then that was a small price to pay.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack jogged down the steps of the bungalow, sucking in a huge lungful of the clean night air. It was a relief to be free. The long evening spent standing in the confines of Proudfoot’s drawing room had awakened the recurring pain in his back, and he needed to find somewhere to sit in peace so that he could try to knead the ache away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Danbury!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His spine stiffened as he recognised the drawled tones calling for his attention.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Stop there, I say.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack forced his tiredness away and turned to face a red-faced Fenris, who was galloping down the steps behind him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Damn you, Danbury. What makes you think you can talk to me like that?’ Fenris opened his tirade whilst still several paces away from where Jack had stopped.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You will call me “sir” when you address me.’ Jack spoke in calm, measured tones, as if addressing a recalcitrant child.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His captain’s sangfroid did nothing to calm Fenris down. ‘I shall not, you damn blackguard. How dare you? Speaking to me in such a way in front of Miss Youngsummers was disgraceful. I should bloody well call you out.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack’s temper started to fray. ‘You will address me correctly at all times and you will be dressed in your regulation uniform when you do so. I will not tolerate an officer in my company going around dressed as some damn nabob.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Go to hell. When Major Proudfoot hears of this—’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I don’t give a damn what Proudfoot says,’ Jack interrupted, with real venom in his voice. ‘You are under my command, not his. You will conduct yourself as I see fit.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Damn your eyes, Danbury.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack reached forward and grabbed Fenris around the arm, pulling the officer forward so his face was inches from his own. ‘Listen to me, Lieutenant. I have no intention of letting a mewling turd under my command tell me what I should or should not do.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris sneered, despite the naked threat in Jack’s eyes. ‘Now look here, Danbury . . .’ He tried to pull out of Jack’s grip, but couldn’t break free from the vice-like hold.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I have fought and killed until my arm felt like lead, and then I fought and killed some more.’ Jack snarled his words into Fenris’ face. ‘I have watched the horror on a man’s face when he realises he is going to die. If you choose to fight me, then I will strike you down.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He released his hold on the lieutenant’s arm, throwing it away abruptly so that Fenris staggered backwards. The younger officer’s face twisted into a snarl and he took a pace forward. Jack saw the violence in his subaltern’s eyes, the shame and the anger burning brightly in his face. He braced himself for a wild rush, his muscles tensing as his body took control, an icy calm flowing through him as he prepared to fight.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Then Fenris turned, his attention taken by the sounds of a hushed and appalled audience. Jack looked past his shaken lieutenant and saw for the first time the large crowd that had gathered at the top of the steps. The look of delighted horror on the fascinated faces made it clear that they had been watching the two officers the whole time as they bawled at each other like a pair of feuding costermongers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Standing at the front of the group, Major Proudfoot caught Jack’s eye. Then with a slow shake of his head he ushered his guests back inside.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack turned and walked away, heedless of the eyes boring into his spine. He did not care if he caused a scandal that would be the talk of the cantonment. Soldiers deserved the best officers, and Jack would not allow them to be commanded by some upper-class popinjay who simply fancied the gold braid and being called ‘sir’. Fenris would have to learn that lesson, no matter how painful it might prove.</p>
