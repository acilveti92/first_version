				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack lay on his bed underneath three sheets and a blanket. The heat of the day had given way to the cooler air of the night. A few months before, he would have been sleeping naked under a linen sheet liberally doused in cold water. Now, with the rainy season past, the nights quickly grew cold and he was glad of the extra blanket.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He lay in the darkness thinking of Sarah Draper. His lust was like an itch that he could not reach. It scratched at his mind, keeping him awake despite the copious amounts of champagne and arrack he had consumed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A floorboard outside his room creaked, interrupting his thoughts. There was nothing unusual in the noise; it interrupted his rest whenever one of the guests enjoying the late-night charms of the Hotel Splendid walked past. He listened for the next creak as the guest carried on down the narrow corridor that ran outside the three rooms on Jack’s side of the hotel.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He heard nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He came fully awake. He slid his hand under his pillow, wrapping his fingers around the reassuring solidity of his revolver. Every instinct screamed out in danger and he slipped from the bed, careful to keep it between him and the door. The draught from the window was cold on his skin, his naked body tingling as he felt the first twist of fear in his gut.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The room was dark, but enough light filtered through the grass tattie at the window to let him see the door handle start to turn slowly. He lifted the revolver, aiming it at the crack that was steadily widening between the door and its frame. As he opened his mouth to challenge the unwelcome visitor, a figure burst into the room. Jack caught a glimpse of bared steel before the talwar slashed down at the bed, the heavy blade slicing deep into the mattress.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There was no need for any further proof of his attacker’s intent. Jack lifted his arm and pulled the trigger, aiming the barrel squarely at the shadowy figure who had burst in to murder him in his bed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The revolver misfired.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His attacker saw the flash as the firing cap went off but failed to ignite the main charge in the first chamber. His eyes immediately picked Jack out in the gloom.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack caught a glimpse of surprise and anger on the man’s face before he leapt across the bed, the sharp talwar slashing at Jack’s head. He ducked away from the blow and threw himself under the bed just as the assassin’s blade slashed down for a second time. He saw a set of fingers grasping the edge of the door as he scrambled back to his feet, so he lashed out, kicking it shut, hearing the yelp of pain as he crushed a second would-be assassin’s fingers beneath the heavy wood. He had time to snap the bolt across the door before the first attacker’s blade slammed into the frame, missing his head by no more than an inch. He twisted away, ducking low as he threw himself past the man who had come to kill him. He had left his own sword on a scarred and battered wooden chest under the window, and he dived forward, his only thought to retrieve his blade. His hand wrapped around the scabbard and he rolled hard to the right, narrowly missing a fast-moving thrust aimed at his naked back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt the madness of battle surge through him, the urge to fight, to hack at the enemy forcing all other thoughts from his mind. His own talwar whispered from the scabbard. He let the madness have its head, releasing the wildness that had kept him alive on the vicious battlefields of the Crimea and the frontier.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In the darkness of the room it was hard to see his attacker as more than a fleeting shadow. Jack released a flurry of blows, cutting hard then following up with a quick thrust, parrying the counters before slamming his talwar forward once again. He let the attacks flow, his sword keening as it cut through the air, the powerful salvo forcing the assassin backwards.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack went after him. There was little room for finesse, so he battered his talwar at his enemy, hacking at the shadowy form. The assassin parried the attacks but the onslaught was relentless. Blow followed blow until one drove the attacker’s sword wide. Jack saw the opening and punched his own sword forward, a shriek of incoherent rage bursting from his lips. He felt the blade slide into the man’s guts and he pushed hard, driving the talwar deep. The man’s scream was piercing as Jack twisted the sword. The assassin fell to the ground, his hands trying to pull his torn stomach together.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The door was kicked open and another figure burst into the room.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stepped backwards, away from his new attacker. The body of the dying assassin fell between the two men and blocked a controlled thrust aimed at Jack’s naked stomach. The second attacker grunted in annoyance before launching another blow. Jack let the blade come at him, then slashed his sword downward, slicing at his opponent’s arm. The blow was weak, the angle of the attack spoiled by the dying man, who flapped and writhed in agony at their feet. But the steel of Jack’s talwar was sharp and it sliced into his enemy’s forearm, gouging a thick crevice in the flesh.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You bastard!’ Jack twisted quickly, narrowly avoiding a counterattack. The oath came to his mouth unbidden, the rage of the fight coursing through him. ‘Come on!’ He punched his blade forward, his wrist already braced for the inevitable parry. When it came, he rotated his talwar, flinging the sword backwards, slicing the sharpened rear tip at his attacker’s eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The man backed away, as Jack knew he would. As soon as he saw the first movement, he threw himself forward, careless of stamping on the ruined body of his first victim. He leapt at his attacker, punching the golden hilt of his sword into the man’s face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt the vicious impact, the crack of breaking bone loud over the pant of exertion that exploded from his own lips. The power of the assault drove the assassin backwards and sent him staggering out of the small room. Jack went after him, battering his sword forward again, smacking it into the centre of his enemy’s face. The second blow knocked the assassin to the ground. As he fell, Jack snapped his knee forward, driving it into the man’s bloodied face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The assassin crashed down, all senses gone, bludgeoned by the salvo of blows. Jack felt nothing as he reversed his blade before stabbing downwards, driving the point into the man’s heart.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt the rush of blood on his bare feet as he turned back into the room, careful not to slip in the puddle that pooled around him. The first attacker lay still, his eyes open and staring, his hands still pressed into the bloody remains of his stomach.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It took Jack less than half a minute to retrieve his fallen revolver and to stuff the uniform he had worn the previous night into his knapsack. Careless of his nakedness, he left the scene of death behind him, taking the stairs two at a time as he made for the narrow alley that snaked around the mismatched buildings of the hotel.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In the alley he paused, his chest heaving with exertion, the cold pricking at his bare skin. Only then did he curse himself for having revealed his wealth. He had taken the risk willingly, his need for money overriding his caution. Now he knew it had been both naïve and foolish, and he swore aloud, his frustration building as he realised that his chance of getting the cash he needed was gone. He spat out a wad of phlegm before delving into his knapsack and retrieving his lieutenant’s uniform.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He would have to throw caution to the wind and leave the shadows behind. He had no other option. It was time for Arthur Fenris to fully rejoin polite society.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled as he thought of Lieutenant Knightly. The man clearly needed a friendly guardian. He remembered the rooms he had seen when he had carried the young officer home. Knightly had rented a fine suite at Hope Hall, a family-run hotel in the Mazagon area of Bombay. There was plenty of space, more than enough for a pair of young lieutenants to form a chummery as they both enjoyed their last few days in Bombay.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was time to pay his new friend a visit.</p>
