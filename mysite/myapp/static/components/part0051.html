				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Prince Abhishek cursed. He stayed at his father’s side, urging his tired horse to keep pace with the Maharajah’s escort even as the British cavalry tore through the men behind him. He dropped his bloodied lance and tugged his talwar from its scabbard, knowing the long reach of the lance would count against him in the vicious melee of hand-to-hand fighting.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The small group broke free and rode for the sharply sided valley that still bore the churned-up, bloodstained soil of the previous day’s fighting. They rode for their lives, staying close to one another as they raced away. Yet their horses were already tired, the long ride from the citadel followed by the charge against Dutton’s sepoys draining much of their strength. There would be no easy escape.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Abhishek glanced over his shoulder and saw the throng of horsemen riding after them. They were led by one of the red-coated devils who had plagued his father’s land for decades. Abhishek knew then what he had to do. His father had to escape. He was the only man capable of binding the kingdom’s wounds and finding a way to secure some sort of future under the oppressive authority of the foreign queen.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He reined in hard, slowing his mount and yanking its head round so that he faced his pursuers. The Maharajah and his remaining lancers did not notice his sudden manoeuvre and raced on, their horses labouring to keep them from the relentless pursuit.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Abhishek threw his head back, calling to his gods, daring them to bear witness to his death. He thrust his spurs into his mount’s sides, making it rear on its haunches before it gathered its last strength and once again strained its aching sinews as it accelerated. Prince Abhishek, heir to the kingdom of Sawadh, was riding to meet his death.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He screamed as he charged, roaring his challenge to the gods he had summoned. He closed on the pursuing riders, urging his tired mount into the gallop, feeling the joy of the charge for the second time that day.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">But this time he knew he would die.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He roared as he slashed his blade at the first figure that rushed past him, his arm jarring as the sharp edge caught the man’s ribcage. The blow knocked the rider from the saddle, his chest sliced open by the single strike, the red stain of blood bright against the gaudy yellow of his jacket.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Abhishek was turning even before the man had hit the ground. He backhanded his weapon, using the sharpened rear to strike at a second rider, slicing across the man’s face to leave a nauseating flap of skin hanging as he scored a deep wound through his features.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The pursuers were turning now, wheeling round to counter the madman who had charged into their midst.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He’s mine!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Abhishek heard the red-coated officer bellow at his men, but he was in no mood to listen. He rose high in the stirrups, urging his horse to leap forward, timing the movement perfectly, punching the tip of his talwar into the spine of the nearest enemy rider. He twisted the blade as soon as he felt it catch the man’s backbone, releasing the weapon from the clutches of his flesh. He had enough time to recover the blade before the red-coated officer came at him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Their blades met, the vicious contact jarring both men’s arms. Neither flinched. They hacked at each other, using their knees to control their mounts as they twisted round. Their swords slashed and parried, yet neither could penetrate the other man’s defences. They bellowed as they fought, grunting with the force of the blows, howling in frustration as they failed to land the telling attack. Parry followed parry, the strikes coming in quick succession, both men fighting with desperate skill as they battled to cut the other down.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack heard the sound of fighting before he could see what has happening. He had urged his mount on, feeling the tremors in the horse’s body as he drove it past the point of exhaustion, cruel in his mastery. He saw Prince Abhishek engaging Lieutenant Fenris, unable to do anything but spur the flagging animal onwards as the two men fought their desperate duel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He was still a hundred yards away when he heard Fenris shriek in victory.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The British officer deflected the prince’s sword wide, finally beating aside the man’s defences. He rammed his sabre forward, punching the tip into the prince’s body, and bellowed in victory as he felt the sword slide into the younger man’s guts, the resistance of the flesh giving way against the vicious blow.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris leant forward, pushing all his weight behind his sword, twisting the blade so that it churned in his opponent’s stomach, the blood pumping from the dreadful wound to run hot and sticky over his hand. He saw the shock on the prince’s face, the searing agony reaching the young man’s eyes.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Die, you bastard.’ Fenris eased his weight forward so his face was inches from the dying prince’s. Vicious in his victory, he spat out the words, his spittle flung to fleck his enemy’s face. ‘I won.’ Abhishek’s eyes glazed over, the prince’s face betraying his youth as he approached death. ‘You lost.’ Fenris gave his blade a final twist before he pulled the sword out, swaying backwards to avoid the body that toppled from the saddle.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The boy hit the ground face first. The Maharajah’s son and heir, the rajkumar, was dead.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Ride them down!’ Fenris snarled the order.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The men from the 1st Bengal Cavalry had watched in horror as the British officer cursed the Maharajah’s son. Now they gathered their reins, exchanging looks with their fellows, disgust mirrored on every face.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Ride, damn you!’ Fenris turned his horse in a tight circle, sneering into the faces of the men who surrounded him. ‘Ride!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The habit of obedience ran deep. The rissaldar who led the riders barked his own orders, throwing his reins forward and spurring his horse away. His men followed, happy to be away from the vicious officer who fought with such disdain.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fenris!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Lieutenant Fenris started at hearing his name. He had thought to take the body of the young prince back to Proudfoot, claiming the reward he knew would be his for removing the only male heir to the throne of Sawadh. He saw a rider hurtling towards him and he felt the hatred flare deep in his veins. It appeared he was being given the chance to bring back two bodies. He smiled as he recognised the opportunity that was being presented to him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He would add the body of the charlatan to that of the foreign prince.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Hello, Arthur,’ Jack called out in greeting before slipping from the saddle as his horse came to a halt.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris turned, a twisted smile on his face. ‘Good timing. You can help me with this corpse.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked down at the body of the prince. He thought of the times he had cursed the Maharajah’s son, damning the prince for the long, hard hours he had endured as he learnt to ride. He recalled too, the jealousy he had felt when he understood the young man’s desire for Isabel. Now, he studied the bloodstained corpse lying face down in the dust and tried to feel nothing, to deny the emotion that surged through him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Put the dirty beggar back on his horse, would you, old chap?’ Fenris stood still as he gave the order, using his sabre to point to the pathetic remains of the Rajkumar of Sawadh.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack saw the calculating look on Fenris’ face. He noticed the sword still held low in his right hand, dripping with Abhishek’s blood. He looked into Fenris’ eyes and saw death.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You killed him. You do it.’ He turned his back on the lieutenant, making as if to walk back to his own horse.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He heard the scrabble of feet on the dusty soil and turned just as Fenris launched himself forward, his sword flung in a wide arc, the blow aimed at Jack’s head. At the last moment, Fenris twisted his wrist, angling the sword down so that it was aimed at the joint of neck and shoulder, the sudden change in direction almost quicker than the eye could detect.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">But Jack was faster. His talwar cut through the air as he lifted it into position to parry the attack he had sensed was coming. He flicked his wrist as the weapons came together, turning his rising blade so that Fenris’ sword sliced along its edge, the cowardly attack blocked and battered away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">In a heartbeat, he went after Fenris. He punched the talwar forward, ready for the inevitable parry, already switching his weight so that he could bring his blade round, slicing it at the red-coated officer’s side. He followed the attack with another, flowing through the movements, his mind watching from afar as Fenris was forced to back away, his sword only just managing to beat aside the series of blows. They came so fast that the lieutenant was given no time to counterattack, and Jack smiled as he fought, feeling the speed coursing through him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris was panting with exertion, sweat slicking his dark hair to his forehead. For the first time, Jack saw panic reach his opponent’s eyes, the terror building as he felt the presence of death looming at his shoulder.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">In desperation, Fenris gambled. He stumbled backwards, moving quickly away from the dreadful talwar that came at him at such speed. The tip of the blade scored across his chest, splitting open the fabric of his scarlet coat. Yet it failed to touch his skin, and the manoeuvre gave him space, his gambit leaving Jack’s defences open.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The moment Jack’s sword went wide, Fenris flung himself forward, driving the tip of his sabre at his opponent’s guts. He had risked his life to launch the attack, and he howled in joy as he saw the blade slip into Jack’s stomach.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt the prick of steel against his flesh. He flung his sword at Fenris’ blade, his calm detachment disappearing in a moment of wild panic. The talwar keened as it whipped through the air, driven by every ounce of strength that Jack possessed.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris’ howl of victory turned into a bitter shriek of frustration as Jack’s sword punched his blade to one side before he had time to drive it home.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack sensed the madness blazing through him. He could feel the ooze of blood on his stomach, the bright pain of the wound flashing across his skull. A feral roar escaped his lips as the wild emotion wrestled away the last of his self-control, the delirium of battle filling every fibre of his being.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He threw himself forward, battering his talwar at the red-coated officer who had come so close to killing him. He let the madness have its head, hacking at Fenris, who was forced to scramble backwards, his sword trying desperately to beat aside the dreadful series of attacks.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fenris screamed as the first blow pierced his defences. The talwar sliced into his side, gouging a thick crevasse in his flesh. Blood poured from the wound, flowing down his body to stain his white breeches. Another attack followed, knocking his sabre from his hand, the last of his defences torn away. As the fight ebbed from his body, he lifted his arms, shielding his face in a pathetic gesture of utter defeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Don’t kill me! Please! I beg you.’ The strength left his legs and he fell heavily on to his backside. ‘Don’t kill me!’ He sobbed the words, waving his arms in from of his face as if he could ward off the killing blow he knew was coming. He tried to shuffle backwards, his arms scrabbling at the rocky ground in a desperate bid to flee, the blood pulsing from his wound leaving a gory smear on the ground.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack advanced after the man he had defeated. The madness of the battle still roared in his ears, and he braced his arm, ready to thrust the talwar forward, any thought of mercy driven from his mind.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Stop!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The command came from behind him. It was a voice of authority but it would not stay his hand. He took a pace forward, ready to kill the pathetic creature begging for his life at his feet.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The crack of a revolver echoed loudly in the confines of the valley. The heavy ball crashed into the rock in front of Jack, the whine of the ricochet whistling past his ears.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I said stop.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The sound of the revolver’s chamber rotating reached Jack’s ringing ears. He considered ramming home his sword regardless, the bitter desire to finish the worm that crawled on the ground in front of him almost too strong to resist.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Jack Lark. I order you to stop.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt the rage leave him. He lowered his sword and turned his back on Fenris, leaving the beaten man to sob in relief as he realised he had been spared.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Major Proudfoot smiled, smug satisfaction writ large on his face.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Thank you, Jack.’ The revolver was still in his hand, a thin trail of smoke leaving the barrel. ‘I am genuinely sorry that I have to do this, but it really is for the best.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He smiled at Jack before he pulled the trigger.</p>
