<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter017">SEVENTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">A tense stillness settled over the room. From somewhere downstairs there came the sound of a door closing. The candles on the altar had burned low now, tall plumes of black smoke rising from the stubs, the flames elongating and flickering, making Humphrey’s shadow loom enormously on the wall behind him. He made no move to replace the candles; indeed, he seemed ill at ease with his new responsibility, lowering himself heavily to sit on the floor beneath the window, his back against the wall. Here he waited uncomfortably, watching me with a brow furrowed in mixed concern and apology. The only sound was my quick, shallow breaths through my nose, as I struggled to keep my breathing even and not to panic at the mass of cloth jamming my mouth. I saw that Humphrey carried a knife at his belt; his fingers strayed to it every few moments, though I was sure that, for all his great size, the young man had a gentle nature and had only reluctantly assumed his role as Jenkes’ strong arm. I wondered if he would have the nerve to use the knife on me if I made an attempt to escape and decided he probably would; his fear of Jenkes would overcome his natural compassion.</p>
<p class="indented">A sharp wind rattled at the shutters; Humphrey started, whipped his head around, then laughed sheepishly at his own nerves. I implored him with my eyes, in case I might appeal to his better nature before Jenkes returned, though I had little hope he would take pity; Humphrey had better reason than anyone to know what Jenkes did to those who endangered the cause.</p>
<p class="indented">My shoulders had begun to ache from the unnatural position of my arms; I tried moving my wrists but the cords were bound too tightly to try wriggling free and cut badly into my flesh if I did so. I thought again of the faces I had recognised at the Mass. There was Richard Godwyn, who distributed Jenkes’s clandestine books, and Rector Underhill’s sharp-eyed old servant, Adam, both associated with the Catherine Wheel and with Lincoln College; either of them might have reasons for silencing the Fellows who had died, if only to protect themselves. Adam in particular, as I had thought earlier, would have no lack of opportunity to spirit away keys from the rector’s lodgings – but if they faithfully attended Mass here, I could see no reason why they would want to draw attention to the Catherine Wheel group. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall. I had to concentrate on finding a way to escape; all this speculation would be worthless if I was to have my throat cut in an alley before sunrise. The thought brought a fresh convulsion of fear as the reality of my present situation began fully to sink in; I had feared for my life before now, but never had I felt so helpless to fight for it.</p>
<p class="indented">I stretched my neck to try and ease the ache in my jaw, making the cut at the base of my throat gape and sting viciously; the pain made me catch my breath suddenly, sucking in a piece of the cloth which lodged in my throat. Half choking, I flung my head from side to side to try and dislodge it, emitting tiny strangled noises as I felt my eyes bulging alarmingly. It was only when I fell sideways with a thud and began writhing on the floor that Humphrey, realising what was happening, leapt to my side and began to claw the gag from my mouth. When finally he had extracted it altogether, I fell back limply against his shoulder, gasping for air, my eyes streaming.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’ll leave it for now, Doctor Bruno, but you’d best not cry for help or I will be obliged to beat you,’ Humphrey whispered apologetically, propping me up against the wall as if I were a doll and watching me with concern.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does he really mean to kill me?’ I asked in a croak, when eventually I could speak.</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey looked at me doubtfully, his big good-natured face pained, as if caught between duty and compassion.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He says you will bring down the Earl of Leicester and all the queen’s soldiers on our heads,’ he whispered, his eyes growing wide, ‘and we shall be taken to the Tower and racked, even the women. Even Widow Kenney, and I won’t let you do that,’ he added, suddenly determined.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are fond of Widow Kenney, then?’ I asked softly.</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey nodded emphatically.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She took me in when I first came to Oxford,’ he said earnestly, in his lilting voice. ‘Six years ago. I didn’t have a penny. Now I have a home and a good job, and it is as if I have a family.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am sure you are of great value to her. Were your own family Catholics?’ I asked, between painful coughs.</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head, again with the same exaggerated movement a child might make, his lips pressed firmly together.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Widow Kenney and Master Jenkes taught me all I know of the true faith. That is why I know we must fight to keep it safe from the heretics.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You said “the women”,’ I prompted, after a while. ‘Are there many women who come to these meetings?’</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey looked at me hesitantly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come now – I will be dead in a few hours, Humphrey, what harm can it do to pass the time by talking to me a little? You will be doing me a kindness.’</p>
<p class="indented">This seemed to sway him, because he shuffled closer on his backside and adopted a conspiratorial tone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There are some women from the town. Not gentlewomen, though – they hear Mass at one of the manor houses in the countryside along with their own sort, mainly. Except for one.’ A kind of softness spread over his face and I sensed I was near my target.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sophia?’</p>
<p class="indented">He blinked in surprise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you know Sophia?’ When I nodded, he beamed. ‘She does not come so often now, but I always know it’s her, even under her hood. She walks like a sort of – like a tree in a breeze, do you know what I mean? Like the willows by the river.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do. And tell me – does Sophia have friends among the group here? I mean, friends she might go to if she were in trouble?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, should she be in trouble, sir?’ he asked innocently, and I found it almost touching that he still called me ‘sir’ even though I was bound hand and foot and he was keeping guard over me with a knife. When I did not reply, he only frowned and shook his head. ‘I do not know her friends. The only one she was close to was Father Jerome, but then everyone loves Father Jerome. It was he who brought her here first.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is Father Jerome?’ I asked, sitting up, my interest piqued. ‘I thought Father William Bernard was your priest here?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh no,’ Humphrey said, proud of his superior knowledge. ‘Father William hardly ever says Mass since Father Jerome came, only if Father Jerome has to be out of town. He goes quite often to Hazeley Court, you know, out in Great Hazeley on the London road, where the grand Catholic families come to hear Mass. I expect he has gone there tonight.’</p>
<p class="indented">My mind was working furiously, but I tried to keep my face and voice even so as not to betray my thoughts.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And this Father Jerome – is he an Oxford man?’</p>
<p class="indented">Again, the exaggerated head-shake.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He came from the college in France.’ He looked stricken. ‘Though that is a great secret and I should not have told you. I beg you, do not tell Master Jenkes I said it, will you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course not. And what is he like, Father Jerome?’</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey’s face took on a dreamy cast.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Like – like I imagine Our Lord Jesus would be if you met him. He makes you feel – I can’t explain it – like he thinks you’re the most special person he ever met, do you know what I mean? Though I don’t understand a lot of the Mass – I have never had book learning, you see – I love to listen when he says it. I like it better than when Father William comes,’ he added, his face creasing into a pout. ‘When Father Jerome speaks, it sounds like music.’ He sighed happily, one hand toying with the knife at his belt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is he a young man?’ I said, leaning forward and moving on to my knees to ease the stiffness in my legs. The movement startled Humphrey out of his reverie; he jerked upright, but when he was certain that I was not attempting anything, he relaxed back against the wall.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Father Jerome has the face of an angel,’ he said reverently. ‘I’ve seen a picture of one,’ he added, presumably lest I think the comparison unfounded.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The face of an angel,’ I repeated slowly, trying to keep as still as possible. I had discovered that the cords binding my ankles were not as tight as those around my wrists; sitting on my heels, I was able to work one finger slowly inside the knot that held them. If I could keep Humphrey talking, he might not notice my surreptitious movements. ‘Tell me about Hazeley Court, then,’ I said lightly. ‘It sounds a grand place.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I have never seen it, but I believe it is very fine. The owner, Sir Francis Tolling, is now in Bridewell Gaol in London for attending private Mass, and his wife uses the house to shelter those who need it. That’s all I know.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Missionary priests, you mean?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Any who labour in the English vineyard and need somewhere safe, out of sight.’ He shifted his weight nervously. ‘There is one among our number, Master Nicholas Owen, who is a master carpenter – he was here tonight, in fact, though you would not have known him under his hood. But he is employed in all the great houses of the faithful, they say, to build secret rooms.’ He leaned in, looking carefully from side to side before lowering his voice further. ‘In the attics, the chimneys, the sewers, the staircases, even inside the walls, so God’s workers can hide from the searchers. Is it not cunning?’ He rubbed his hands together and beamed with delight. ‘Though I should not have said that either – you won’t tell Jenkes, will you? Are you all right, sir?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What? Oh – yes, it is nothing. My shoulder pains me a bit, that is all.’ I realised that I had been screwing my face up and clenching my jaw in concentration as I tried to poke one end of the knot through with only one finger. It was so close to coming free, it would not do for Humphrey to suspect me now. He nodded in sympathy, and glanced furtively at the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wonder if I might loosen your bonds a bit, sir,’ he said, his eyes flitting again to the door as if Jenkes might burst through at any moment. ‘Not altogether, I mean, just so you’re not in pain. After all, it’s not as if you’d get very far is it, you being so little, and me with the knife and all?’ He laughed, though I detected a note of anxiety, and I joined in heartily at the absurd idea of my overpowering him. In truth, I had no idea of how I might proceed, even if I did manage to free my legs; without the use of my arms I could do nothing, and even with them I did not much rate my chances in a fight against Humphrey, with or without a knife. While he deliberated about whether to loosen my ropes and I continued my own attempt as best I could behind my back, there came the unmistakeable creak of a tread in the corridor outside and we both froze. My throat contracted; I had not expected Jenkes to return so soon, and my escape plan faded before it was even fully formed. I took a deep breath, as well as I was able with my heart thudding in the back of my mouth. So this was it, I thought. Back in Italy, at San Domenico Maggiore, I had invited a death sentence for the sake of a book; now, after running from it all these years, I faced death again, all because I was too foolishly greedy for a book. Well, I thought, I would try whatever means I could to fight, and if I must die, at least I would not die like a coward under Rowland Jenkes’s mocking glare.</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey gathered his wits as the footsteps drew closer, snatching up Jenkes’s linen scarf and shoving it back into my mouth, though more loosely than it had been before, just as I felt the end of the rope pop through and the knot at my ankles subtly slacken under my scrabbling fingers. The footsteps halted outside the door and there was a tentative knock, followed by a woman’s voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Humphrey? Is that you?’</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey deflated visibly with relief, and scrambled to his feet to open the door. Widow Kenney stood outside in her nightgown, holding a candle, a woollen shawl around her shoulders. She looked first at Humphrey, then at me in my sorry state, bundled into a corner on the floor, and exhaled with exasperation.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That Jenkes,’ she said, still looking at me with a reproving moue, as if Jenkes were a naughty cat and I a dead mouse he had dropped on her clean floor. ‘What is he making you do now, Humphrey?’</p>
<p class="indented">The boy hung his head and Widow Kenney beckoned him towards the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let me speak with you a moment.’ She studied me briefly as if assessing the danger of leaving me unattended, then appeared to decide I was harmless. ‘I have told him, I will not have blood shed in my inn,’ she hissed at Humphrey as she ushered him into the corridor, ‘and you should know better, Humphrey Pritchard.’ I did not catch his protest but the murmur of their urgent exchange was audible beyond the closed door.</p>
<p class="indented">I had to act quickly. Without the need to conceal my movements from Humphrey, I tugged at the loosened end of the knot binding my ankles and it came loose in my hand. Shaking my legs free of the cord as fast as I could, I struggled painfully to my feet and hobbled across the room to the small makeshift altar, where the candles had almost burned down to the sticks. With my back to the altar, I tried to position the knot fastening the bindings around my wrists over the flame, hoping it would burn through, but the cord was sturdier than it looked and the flame feeble; though I could smell it beginning to singe, I doubted whether the knot would break before Humphrey came back and caught me. Outside in the passageway, the voices grew louder in heated argument. Because I could not see what I was doing, I kept scorching my hands on the flame and was grateful this time for the cloth in my mouth that muffled my cries as I did so. My greatest fear was that I would knock the candle and set my clothes alight; to escape a burning at the hands of the Inquisition only to bring one on myself by accident would be beyond irony, I thought, as I twisted the cord first one way and then another over the flame, trying to arch my arms as far as I could from my body. The cord crackled suddenly and I felt a rush of fierce heat on my right hand; the knot had caught fire, and I screamed into the cloth as the flame seared my hand and sleeve, but the knot had loosened enough for me to pull my hands out. The flaming coils of cord fell to the floor and I stamped on them furiously, clutching my burned hand to my chest and catching a whiff of scorched flesh as I did so. The voices outside the door silenced abruptly and I knew I would only have one chance at getting past them. Ignoring the pain of my stretched and blistered skin, I grabbed the heavy silver candlestick from the altar, blew out the guttering flame and held it aloft just as Humphrey flung the door open and paused for just an instant, his mouth gaping at the sight.</p>
<p class="indented">His hesitation was just long enough; before he could raise his arms, I swung the solid base of the candlestick at his temple. My aim was good; there was a sickening crunch and he fell backwards, blood spurting from the gash, matting his fair hair. His large body crumpled to the floor; he appeared to be knocked out cold. The widow held up her hands in fright and shook her head violently, her mouth working in terrified silent protest; holding the candlestick aloft again so that she cowered into a corner, I wrested the knife from Humphrey’s belt, threw the candlestick back at her feet with a last warning look and darted through the door into the corridor. All down the crooked stairs and across the inn yard I fully expected to see Jenkes at any moment and kept the knife levelled in front of me lest he appear, while glancing back over my shoulder to see if Humphrey might have revived to pursue me, but it seemed fortune was on my side at last; I emerged from the gates of the inn yard into the street without seeing a soul.</p>
<p class="indented">The sky was still dark, etched with streaks of moonlight between the clouds, and I rested for a moment against the wall of a house to catch my breath, realising that in all the frenzy I had not stopped to remove the scarf gagging me. Now I extracted it and, holding one end in my teeth, wrapped it gingerly around my burned hand. The pain made me briefly dizzy, so that I feared my legs might buckle beneath me, and once the temporary exhilaration of my escape had subsided, I realised with a falling sensation that my purse had been stolen and I had no means of getting past the watchmen at the North Gate. Even worse, I thought, what if they knew Jenkes well and had been tipped by him to watch out for me? In this city, it was impossible to know who was a friend.</p>
<p class="indented">The square tower of St Michael’s Church at the North Gate rose above the battlements of the city wall, its silhouette a landmark as I crept along under the eaves of houses until I was forced to break my cover and run across the broad street that lay parallel to the city wall. I looked wildly from side to side as I dashed over, anticipating the sight of Jenkes at any moment, but the street was empty. At the gate I paused, but could think of no other means of gaining the city again; the wall was far too high and sheer to be scaled and all the other gates would be guarded too at this hour. My only choice was to wait until first light, when the gates would be opened to traders, by which time Jenkes or Humphrey would likely have caught up with me, or to try and persuade the watchmen I had already paid to let me back. I banged with the flat of my good hand on the small door set into the high oak gates but there was no reply. I hammered harder and called out, and at last a bleary face appeared behind the square iron grille. Eventually I heard the scrape of a bolt and the door opened.</p>
<p class="indented">I murmured my gratitude, glancing around again for signs of movement in the dark streets, and as soon as I was out of the watchman’s sight, I picked up my pace and ran the short way up St Mildred’s Lane, holding tight to the handle of Humphrey’s knife. Never had I been so glad to see the tower of Lincoln College looming above me. Gently I tapped on the narrow window of Cobbett’s room. After a pause, I tapped again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett!’ I hissed, as loudly as I dared. ‘It is I, Bruno – open the gate!’</p>
<p class="indented">I was greeted only by silence. Hoisting myself up to the sill, I peered in and saw the old porter lolling in his chair, his chin slumped on his chest and his mouth gaping, a skein of spittle hanging from his lower lip.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett!’ I called again, tapping the window harder, but he did not stir. Cursing under my breath, I stepped back and looked up at the college walls; all the windows were dark and I wondered whether I dared risk waking anyone else by calling louder. I did not want to be left in the street outside the college; that would be one of the first places Jenkes would choose to look for me. Then, as the clouds shifted and a thin ray of pearly moonlight broke through, I remembered another possibility and hoped my guess was right. The very furthest window on the west range belonged to Norris’s room; though it appeared closed, I managed to jam the fingers of my good hand inside the frame and found that it had indeed been left unlatched. As far as I could see into the darkness, the lane appeared to be empty in both directions. As I heaved myself up and levered myself sideways through the narrow opening, flinching as I scraped my burned hand against the frame, I prayed that neither of the room’s occupants had returned during the evening.</p>
<p class="indented">I tumbled through the window, landing awkwardly on the large wooden chest beneath. I froze for a moment, listening for the sound of breathing or movement from the bedchamber beyond, but the stillness was that of an empty room. A faint light from the window facing into the quadrangle outlined the shapes of furniture; the floor seemed to be littered with debris and after some tripping and fumbling across the surfaces of dressers and tables, I managed to locate a tinderbox that had been left on an ornamental table under the window. Striking it, I lit a stub of candle on the desk and looked around to see the room in a state of chaos, just as Roger Mercer’s room had been on the morning he was killed. Clothes had been flung from the wardrobe, books and papers scattered and all the drawers of Norris’s fine writing desk pulled open and emptied.</p>
<p class="indented">I slumped down on the settle by the long-cold fireplace, its cushions all thrown about the hearth, and tried to make myself breathe calmly for the first time in what felt like hours as I gathered my frayed thoughts. My shoulders ached insistently, my burned hand was throbbing and the cut at my throat stung, though it was not deep, but now that I was out of immediate danger I found I was able to think more sharply and clearly. Not that the danger had passed, of course; Jenkes had already decided that I knew too much to be left alone and once he discovered my escape he would almost certainly try to track me down before I could speak to anyone. From my conversation with Humphrey, a theory had begun to take shape in the back of my mind about the murders, though as yet it was still hazy, like figures seen through fog. If my guesswork was correct, then I thought I knew where I might find the answers. And if Jenkes was to be believed, I had to get there before dawn, before Thomas Allen was silenced for good.</p>
<p class="indented">First, though, I needed to get word to Sidney, so that he would know where I had gone and the suspicions that had led me there; I hoped then he would be able to follow if I did not return – even though by then it might be too late.</p>
<p class="indented">Without wasting any more time, I began to comb through the mess of paper and books on Norris’s writing desk for a quill to set down my thoughts for Sidney as briefly as I could before setting off in pursuit, but I could find no ink. Inside the first open drawer, I discovered a stick of vermilion sealing wax and several sheets of fine-quality writing paper. The candle I had lit was burning low; as I glanced quickly around the room to see if there was another to hand, my eye fell on the chest beneath the window. The solid padlock that had secured it was hanging open; it had clearly been forced. Grabbing the dying candle, I prised open the heavy lid, but the trunk appeared to contain only linen undershirts. Undeterred, I rummaged through swathes of cloth until my fingers scraped the wooden base of the trunk and probed into all four corners, yielding nothing. I cursed silently; it seemed anything of value here had already been taken. I brought the candle close and flung out all the contents, scattering them about the floor until I could bring the candle into the depths of the chest and confirm that it was truly empty.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Merda</em>!’ I was about to close the lid when I noticed a small corner of the wood cut away in the floor of the chest, barely wide enough to slip in a fingernail. Setting down the candle, I pulled Humphrey’s kitchen knife from my belt, leaned into the trunk and was just able to insert the tip of the blade into the gap and work it upwards, my heart pounding. There was a soft click, and I felt the wood loosen. I pushed down and the false bottom lifted up easily; reaching into the compartment beneath, my fingers brushed a sheaf of papers before closing on something sharp that pricked my skin, making me draw my hand back quickly in case it was a trap. Reaching in again, more gingerly this time, I pulled out the offending object into the dim light and gave a low whistle when I realised what I held.</p>
<p class="indented">It was a short-handled whip with perhaps forty or fifty cords tied to the end, each cord the length of about half a yard and studded with hard knots. Through each of these many knots was threaded a short piece of crooked wire bent into a hook, and many of these hooks bore traces of dried blood and torn flesh. I shuddered at the cruelty of the instrument, while at the same time it was as if the scales had fallen from my eyes and the suspicions that had formerly floated as if in thick fog suddenly emerged in almost total clarity.</p>
<p class="indented">I reached again into the secret compartment and pulled out the sheaf of papers I had felt earlier. It proved to be a package of dog-eared letters, dirty and tied with fraying ribbon. The topmost paper bore the unmistakeable imprint of a bloody thumb. One glance at the faded ink of the uppermost letter confirmed that these were written in a combination of symbols and numbers, but I did not need to decipher them to know that these were the letters for which Roger Mercer and James Coverdale’s room had been searched. Tied together with the bundle of letters was another document, this one on older vellum and sealed with wax. The seal was still intact and in the fading light its mark was indistinct, but I hesitated only a moment before breaking the seal and unfolding the document, holding it next to the candle stub. The flame was so faint now that it barely illuminated the elaborate curling script, but the first line was enough to make my breath seize for a moment in my throat.</p>
<p class="indented"><em class="calibre2">Pius, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, in lasting memory of the matter: Regnans in excelsis</em>, it began, and I almost dropped it, my hands had begun to shake so hard. I knew immediately what I held. This was perhaps the most damning paper an Englishman could possess: a copy of the Papal Bull issued by Pope Pius V some thirteen years ago, declaring Queen Elizabeth of England a heretic and containing her sentence of excommunication from the Catholic Church. It ended by forbidding the queen’s subjects from recognising or obeying her as monarch; in those words, Pius had all but called for her to be overthrown. This was the Bull that some of the more extreme Catholics in the European seminaries regarded as a licence to assassinate the queen in God’s name. Even to bring a copy into this country was high treason and would earn the one who carried it a traitor’s death. I exhaled slowly, then froze as I thought I heard a scuffling sound outside the window. Had I walked directly into another trap? Whoever had ransacked this room had undoubtedly been looking for these papers, just as he had been searching for them in Mercer’s room, yet he had not found the chest’s secret compartment. Perhaps he was still watching the room and had seen my candle. I held my breath and caught another distinct movement outside; then a high, unearthly scream rent the air, followed by another, a sound like nothing so much the shriek of an infant in pain, and I sank back to the floor, trembling and laughing at my own skittishness; it was only a pair of foxes fighting in the lane.</p>
<p class="indented">But the disturbance had brought me to my senses and reminded me that there was no time to waste. I tied the package of letters in one of the linen shirts from the chest, where I also found a travelling cloak that I hastily fastened around my shoulders, my own having been left at the Catherine Wheel. After some scrabbling I located an inkwell under the detritus on Norris’s desk and wrote a hasty note to Sidney explaining where the items had been found and where I was going. This done, I reached inside my shirt and pulled out the sheet of paper with the copy of the code from Mercer’s almanac; this I folded inside the note to Sidney and sealed it as best I could with the sealing wax I had found in the drawer, though I had no ring to imprint on it. Then I grabbed the package, blew out the guttering candle, lifted the latch of the door to the stairwell and found it locked fast. Whoever had turned over the room in Norris and Allen’s absence must have let himself in with his own key, unless he too had climbed in the window. Cursing again, I wrestled open the window above the desk that gave on to the courtyard, struggled on to the sill, encumbered now by my bandaged hand and the package I was trying to hold secure under the other arm, and eased myself through, unfortunately catching the cloak on the window latch at the last minute and falling through sideways with a thud and a muffled cry.</p>
<p class="indented">I lay quietly for a moment in the hope that my movements had gone unheard, looking up at the marbled sky above the roofs, already turning from velvet black to a dark indigo behind the streaks of cloud. If the sky was growing lighter, I needed to get this business done and hurry out of the city before dawn. It was too dark to make out the hands of the clock; the quadrangle remained blanketed in the stillness of the dead hours. Nothing stirred; somewhere distant the fox cried again and I was about to pick myself up when I saw the lantern. It approached me at a quick pace from the buildings opposite, held up by a hooded figure who stopped, looming over me, and lowered the light to the level of my face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, well, Doctor Bruno. Helping yourself again? This is becoming quite a habit. What will your explanation be this time, I wonder? I can hardly wait to find out.’</p>
<p class="indented">I could not see Walter Slythurst’s face, but his malevolent smirk was apparent in every icy word.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter015" class="calibre4">FIFTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Catherine blanched, but did not lose her composure; only her free hand flailed, clawing the air in search of support. I stepped to her side and she grasped my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where? How?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In the gardens – she was found – all bloodied – oh <em class="calibre6">madonna santa</em>, what shall we do?’ Balthasar was struggling to form sentences between snatched breaths. He pressed his hands to his face. Catherine inhaled sharply, her eyes calculating. Only I could feel how hard her fingers were gripping my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘This must be kept quiet,’ she said, at length. ‘Get up. Have her brought in through the back door by the kitchen, down to the cellar.’</p>
<p class="indented">Balthasar rose unsteadily to his feet, shaking his head. ‘Too late for that, I fear – the people who found her made such a commotion it drew others to the site. Someone ran for the guards. They are bringing her to you now. They didn’t know what else to do,’ he added, spreading his hands to show his helplessness.</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine’s face tightened. ‘Through the palace? For all to see? God save us – does no one here <em class="calibre6">think</em>?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You must have all the gates barred immediately,’ I said. ‘If she has been killed, the murderer must be here in the palace. He – or she – will most likely try to leave as soon as possible, if they have not already done so. Your guards should detain anyone attempting to escape in a hurry. If we are fortunate, we may even catch them with blood or a weapon on their person.’</p>
<p class="indented">She turned to look up at me with slow amazement, as if she had only now remembered I was there.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you give the commands here? We do not yet know what has happened. If these fools have sown panic, people will naturally rush to leave. I cannot keep them against their will while accusing them of murder. That will only make matters worse.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Even if one among them is guilty of it? In the light of our conversation before …’</p>
<p class="indented">Her eyes hardened and I felt her hand clamp tighter. ‘Have I not just impressed upon you that I know how to govern my own household?’ She spoke through her teeth. ‘We must impose order on this situation immediately. Balthasar, mobilise the guards, make sure they prevent—’</p>
<p class="indented">But her orders were interrupted by a further crash and judder of the doors as two men barged their way into the gallery bearing a limp body between them, a curtain of dark hair hanging down and swaying with the motion. In their wake surged a crowd of guests, shrieking and shoving one another for a better look.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You!’ Catherine roared, pointing at the guards flanking the doors to her chamber. ‘Get those people out of my private apartments. Call your fellows and make sure the guests are confined to the public rooms downstairs. Find the captain of my household guard and send him to me. Keep the doors barred.’</p>
<p class="indented">Her armed men jumped to obey and after some struggle the spectators were pushed back and the outer doors to the gallery closed. The two guards carrying the body laid her down gently on the wooden floor, her hair and white cloak spreading around her. Smears of blood stood out bright crimson against the white. Balthasar turned his face away, shielding his eyes, just as the air was shattered by a chorus of women’s screams, as the nymphs burst from Catherine’s inner chamber and skidded to a halt before the corpse of their friend.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Get back inside,’ Catherine ordered, in a voice that brooked no argument; howling and clutching one another, the girls obeyed. Their laments could be heard loudly after the doors had closed behind them.</p>
<p class="indented">Left alone, Catherine looked from me to Balthasar. Her face was pinched but she kept her bearing erect. ‘Where is my physician? Fetch him here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I believe he did not attend tonight, Your Majesty,’ Balthasar whimpered, unable to take his eyes from Léonie’s body.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Send for him at his house, then. And find Ruggieri. Anyone who can tell me what happened here. And, Balthasar – fetch the King to me immediately. Whatever he’s doing, drag him from it bodily if you have to.’</p>
<p class="indented">Balthasar shot me a brief glance, lowered his eyes to the corpse and scurried away, a hand pressed over his mouth to stifle his grief. If he were not Italian and theatrical, I might have said he was overdoing it.</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine let go of my arm and walked around the body. The girl’s eyes bulged in terror, her face drained white, the lips peeled back in a grimace. Her wrists and arms were smeared with blood and dirt. Dead leaves had tangled in her curtain of hair.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well. Whatever threat you thought she posed to the King, she is none now,’ Catherine remarked quietly. She did not seem particularly distraught by the murder of a young woman who had served her for thirteen years, but that did not necessarily mean anything; she belonged to an age when a queen was expected to conceal her private feelings at all costs.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No. Someone has made certain of that,’ I said. We looked at one another. I suspected we were both wondering the same thing. There was a long pause. I cleared my throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your Majesty,’ I ventured, ‘I have some knowledge of anatomy and a little experience in instances of unnatural death. Might I be permitted to make a cursory examination?’</p>
<p class="indented">Her brow creased. ‘It would not be seemly for you to handle the body of a young woman. You are not a physician.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Neither is Ruggieri. He is an astrologer.’ <em class="calibre6">And a charlatan</em>, I wanted to add, but held my tongue. ‘With respect, Your Majesty, I would not be seeing anything she did not already show to three hundred spectators this evening.’</p>
<p class="indented">Again, I had the sense that her first instinct was to slap me, but instead she regarded the body in silence, her jaw working from side to side. At length she prodded Léonie’s limp arm with the end of her stick, turning it to expose the inside of the wrist. ‘See here. I am no physician either, but this has the appearance of self-slaughter, would you not say?’ I caught a note of supplication in her voice; she wanted me to confirm her conclusion.</p>
<p class="indented">I had already registered the slashes to the wrist, but I had also observed Léonie’s face. I crouched by the body and looked up at Catherine.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The appearance, yes. If I may?’</p>
<p class="indented">She pursed her lips, then nodded a grudging agreement. I lifted the right hand to show her. ‘These wounds are too superficial to have bled out. They are made horizontally across the wrist. The vein is not severed – see? These cuts could not have killed her.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then – what?’ For the first time, I glimpsed the mask of control slip a fraction. Catherine de Medici was frightened. I could not blame her; we both knew the person who had felt most threatened by Circe that night was Henri, and that it was I who had planted that fear.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Look.’ I lifted the coils of hair that had draped across her neck. ‘See this bruise at the throat, and the flecks of blood in the eyes? She was strangled, with a ligature by my guess. I think the incisions were made afterwards.’</p>
<p class="indented">Garrotted, I thought, by someone who knew what they were doing. Just like Joseph de Chartres. It must have happened quickly, before she could scream for help; there had been enough couples seeking out a private spot in the wood for someone to have heard something otherwise. I recalled the cry that had echoed through the trees while I was tussling with the man in the Greek mask, that I had taken for a woman in the throes of passion; could that have been Léonie? My stomach knotted at the thought that I might have been close enough to save her.</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine appeared to be digesting this.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is an interesting theory, Doctor Bruno. But as you say, you are not a physician. I suggest we do not leap to any conclusions. I will reserve judgement until I have heard an expert opinion.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you must have the clearing and the woods searched for any traces the killer may have left behind. The knife that was used, for a start. If she died by her own hand it would still be there.’</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine shifted her weight again and looked at me with a curious intensity. In the same instant I realised my mistake.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Clearing?’ she said, raising an eyebrow. ‘Woods?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Or wherever she was found. Balthasar mentioned—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Balthasar said she was found in the gardens, as I recall. You are the one who has introduced this clearing in the woods.’ Her gaze drifted again to my boots. I had a sudden dread that Gabrielle might have told her I was asking questions about Circe and that even now Catherine was drawing her own conclusions, pleased to have found a ready scapegoat.</p>
<p class="indented">But I was spared the necessity of responding as the door opened once again to admit a figure like a great crow, black wings flapping the length of the gallery. As he drew nearer I realised he was wearing the same costume as me, the Dottore from the Commedia, in black gown and sneering beaked mask. When he untied the mask and lifted it, the face beneath wore a remarkably similar expression of contempt.</p>
<p class="indented">Cosimo Ruggieri still wore his white beard long and forked, in emulation of some long-ago fashion of the Florentine aristocracy which he supposed gave him the look of a magus. He had developed more of a squint since I last saw him, presumably because he was too vain to admit his eyes were failing. He had always claimed to be older than his years in order to seem more venerable, but he must be at least of an age with Catherine; where she had grown stout, Ruggieri seemed to have shrivelled, his skin stretched tight over the bones of his face, dry and lined as one of his alchemical parchments.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gracious Queen,’ he began, in his grandiose manner, offering her a sweeping bow but keeping his greedy little eyes trained on me, ‘it can be no accident that such black misfortune should befall your noble house on the day this Neapolitan sorcerer dares to show himself uninvited at your feast.’</p>
<p class="indented">I could not hold my tongue. ‘Sing a different tune, Ruggieri. At least no one has ever accused me of keeping a child’s severed head on an altar to speak prophecies.’</p>
<p class="indented">He gave a dusty laugh that rattled in his throat. ‘What need have you of an intermediary, when it is known you commune with the Devil face to face?’</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine rapped her stick hard on the floor. ‘Gentlemen! A woman is dead. I did not call you here to bicker like children.’</p>
<p class="indented">Ruggieri looked briefly chastened, which gave me some satisfaction. ‘Tell me how I may be of service, Majesty,’ he said, holding out his hands in supplication.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I want you to look at this girl. Tell me what you think happened to her.’</p>
<p class="indented">His eyes darted nervously to me; clearly he feared it might be a trick question. He made a great show of pacing around the body, pulling at the twin points of his beard in contemplation. When he could delay no longer, he addressed Catherine.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It would seem she has dispatched her own soul to Hell. A sin against God and nature,’ he added, adopting a suitably sage expression. I snorted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno says otherwise,’ Catherine said, watching me carefully.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno says the universe is infinite, but he has no proof of that either.’</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine allowed a flicker of a smile, but it did not touch her eyes. I considered confessing to her that I had encountered Léonie in the copse and repeating what she had said to me in error, but instinctive caution told me I would not help my own cause by placing myself at the scene of yet another murder, particularly after my ill-judged comment about the clearing, and in any case, the moment had passed; I should have spoken before Ruggieri arrived.</p>
<p class="indented">I glanced across at the old sorcerer. Léonie had been waiting for someone. She had been in a state of considerable distress, but had steeled herself to tell that person she could not go ahead with a task they had evidently demanded of her – a task she was terrified of carrying out, something so grave she believed it would damn her soul. I could think of few sins that would appear so terrible to a woman steeped in the casual debauchery of Catherine’s court, except murder. To my ears, Léonie’s wild words had as good as confirmed Paul’s letter and his dying warning: that she had been part of a plot to kill the King.</p>
<p class="indented">The more I turned over her outburst in my mind, the more tantalisingly this hypothesis took shape: she had been charged by some unknown person to assassinate Henri and had lost her nerve. The conspirators manipulating her realised she had become a danger to them – especially if they learned that she had confessed her treasonable plans to a priest – and decided she needed to be silenced. I could go so far as to speculate that, since she had once been Guise’s lover, the Duke may still have some hold over her; it seemed the most likely explanation. Although there was always an alternative possibility that could not yet be discounted: that the King, alarmed by my warning, had acted on impulse to disarm the threat of Circe for good. I could see full well that this was the fear behind Catherine’s reluctance to accept that the girl had been murdered. I wondered if Ruggieri had reached the same conclusion and scrambled to support his mistress with the verdict she wanted to hear; no one with even a passing knowledge of anatomy could seriously suppose the girl to have killed herself. But one other question troubled me: had Léonie mistaken me for the man she was expecting, <em class="calibre6">because I was wearing the same costume?</em></p>
<p class="indented">Ruggieri shivered and wrapped his Doctor’s robe closer around him, the empty mask swinging from his hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We do not usually hear you so quiet, Bruno. Is it because you dislike being told you are wrong?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was only wondering,’ I said, ‘why you are so certain she took her own life? Did she have particular cause that you know of?’</p>
<p class="indented">Catherine made a gesture that seemed to imply the question was redundant. ‘Young women. Thwarted affair of the heart or some nonsense. She would not be the first to fall into despair because a man had cast her aside.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you just said your women do not involve themselves with men except at your command,’ I said. Her eyes narrowed. ‘I wondered,’ I continued, keeping my tone light, ‘if perhaps it could have been because she was with child?’</p>
<p class="indented">The silence that followed this was so profound I could hear the ice cracking on the window panes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What makes you say that?’ Catherine asked, in a voice like a knife on a whetstone.</p>
<p class="indented">I was about to answer, but at that moment King Henri burst in, distraught and dishevelled, his doublet unlaced and his cream silk stockings caked with mud. He threw himself to his knees beside Léonie’s body and manoeuvred her torso clumsily into his lap.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre6">Mon Dieu</em>,’ he moaned softly, rocking her back and forth, her head hanging limply in his arms like a grotesque doll. He repeated this lament, the words muffled as he pressed his lips against her hair. The rest of us stood awkwardly watching this performance until Catherine clapped her hands and ordered her son to get up.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Have you been drinking? You know what the physician said about your constitution – you are not supposed to touch wine. Put the girl down, Henri,’ she added briskly, as if talking to a dog, though the King appeared not to hear. He remained folded over Léonie’s body, his face wracked with pain, but I could not have said for certain whether it was grief or remorse. Henri was prone to dramatics either way.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will speak to the King in private,’ Catherine announced. ‘Ruggieri – take Doctor Bruno to the library and keep him there until I send for you again. Have the servants bring you meat and drink. And <em class="calibre6">you</em>—’ she raised her walking stick and pointed it towards me with finality – ‘will not repeat to anyone what you said just now. If that idle speculation finds its way into common gossip, I will have you arrested for slander. Do you understand me?’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded. I, too, would have liked to speak to the King in private, but there was no question of that at present. Catherine meant to manage this situation in her own way. I tried to catch Henri’s eye, but he would not raise his head from the corpse in his arms.</p>
<p class="indented">I followed Ruggieri along the corridors, empty now of guests but with a noticeable increase of armed guards, halberds bristling at every set of doors, though they parted swiftly for the astrologer as he strode towards them with his hand raised like Moses before the Red Sea. When we reached the library, he bade me take a seat at a table in front of the fireplace, on which large star maps and charts of the heavens lay unfurled, curling at the edges, held flat by several measuring instruments. Though the papers were upside down to me, I leaned across and peered at them with curiosity while he bustled about lighting a sconce of candles. It looked as if Ruggieri had been plotting a natal chart; the margins of the map were filled with gnomic scribbles in his cramped handwriting. In the top right-hand corner I saw that he had drawn the figure of a dolphin.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Whose chart?’ I asked, tapping the map.</p>
<p class="indented">He blew out the taper and leapt across with surprising speed, gathering the papers and rolling them tightly together. ‘No business of yours.’</p>
<p class="indented">The way he pursed his lips, all puffed up with the importance of his confidential knowledge, made me determined not to give him the satisfaction of pressing him any further. He paced behind my chair while I ignored him. ‘Whatever made you say the girl was with child?’ he asked, at last. I swivelled to face him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You did not observe her during the masque tonight?’</p>
<p class="indented">He made a derisive noise. ‘I did not. I was in here all evening, working. I don’t need to see those girls writhing about. Give me a seizure, at my age.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nonsense. I knew a man in Nola older than you, fathered twins.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well. No idea of continence, you Nolans. What would I want with twins?’ He raised his hands in retreat, as if someone were threatening to hand him a pair. ‘Tell me about the girl, then. I have seen her recently – I did not remark that she had a big belly.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not especially big at this stage. But there was a tell-tale sign, visible only because her gown tonight was so thin. She had the line on her belly, though very faint – she was still in the early months.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Line?’ He frowned.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The dark line that forms on the skin from the navel to the pubis. Have you not observed this in a woman expecting?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am not a midwife, Bruno,’ he said, with a little shudder of distaste. ‘Your experience of looking at pregnant women unclothed is clearly broader than mine, but then you are a Dominican. Ah. I see that amuses you.’</p>
<p class="indented">I could hardly tell him I was nodding because it was true that my only previous experience of seeing a pregnant woman naked had been as a young novice at the convent of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, though not in the way Ruggieri imagined.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course, I may be mistaken,’ I said, conciliatory. The suggestion that Léonie might have been pregnant had clearly caused Catherine further anxiety; I could guess why.</p>
<p class="indented">His shoulders relaxed. ‘You would do well to say so to the Queen Mother. Bad enough that this dreadful business has occurred during an event that was supposed to increase goodwill towards the royal family. She does not need you spreading malicious lies as well.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not lies. Merely speculation.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Based on the scantest evidence and likely wrong, by your own admission. Like all your other theories, in your books which no one reads.’</p>
<p class="indented">I reminded myself silently not to rise to it. Fortunately I was distracted by the arrival of a boy in livery bearing a tray loaded with two plates of roast pheasant and large silver goblets of spiced wine. Ruggieri swept the remainder of his books from the table, not without a good deal of muttering, and the boy set the tray down with a bow, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">Ruggieri and I looked at one another.</p>
<p class="indented">‘After you,’ I offered, indicating the plates.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you are our guest,’ he returned, mirroring my gesture.</p>
<p class="indented">I smiled. ‘I find I am not hungry after all.’ It was a lie; my stomach growled, empty and sour from my earlier drinks, and the hot scent of roasted meat was making my gut cramp with hunger, but I would be a fool to ignore the advice I had given the King earlier, especially in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="indented">The old man gave one of his dry, rattling laughs. ‘Are you suspicious of our hospitality? Do you suppose she means to poison you?’</p>
<p class="indented">I said nothing. It was rumoured that Catherine had plotted to poison her own daughter not so long ago; she was more than capable of dispatching me without a second thought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is like a fairground riddle, is it not?’ Ruggieri continued, enjoying himself. ‘If I choose first, you will assume the other glass is poisoned. If I allow you to choose first, you will assume both are. If we were to drink at the same time, however—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t have time for your games,’ I said, irritated.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Pardon me, but you have all the time in the world. You are to remain Her Majesty’s guest here until further notice.’</p>
<p class="indented">I turned away and slumped back against the chair. ‘Drink or don’t drink, Ruggieri, it’s of no interest to me.’ I pressed my sleeve against my face to try and block out the scent of the meat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let this reassure you, then.’ He pulled up his chair again, picked up one glass and drank from it, followed by the other. He did the same with a piece of meat from both plates, smiling with what I assumed was meant to be encouragement, though it still looked menacing. Warily, after a few moments, I reached across and took one of the plates from his hand. The meat was tender and savoury, and I devoured it in a hurry.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There was a book,’ I said, licking the last of the juices from my fingers. His head snapped up, immediately alert. ‘About a year ago, Queen Catherine bought it from an English girl. I see you know the one I mean.’</p>
<p class="indented">He sat back, nodding. ‘Yes, I thought you might come sniffing after that sooner or later. The girl was keen to insist on her acquaintance with you. She seemed to believe that would lend the book veracity.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And on the strength of that, Catherine bought it. Fifty écus, I heard.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She asked me to examine it first, naturally,’ he said, ruffled. ‘I thought it might prove a worthwhile addition to her collection. I wanted to pay less but the girl bargained hard. You clearly schooled her well. I do wonder, though, that you should have allowed such a book out of your hands.’</p>
<p class="indented">I chose to ignore the implicit question. ‘You know what it is then.’</p>
<p class="indented">He folded his hands together on the table. His fingers were long and spindly with swollen joints, the tips stained purple from one of his concoctions, I presumed, though for a moment I had an image of him in his private room, picking through entrails to divine the future like an ancient Roman.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I can see what it purports to be. The lost book of the Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus. Last rumoured to have been stolen from a bookseller in Venice, though that was two decades ago. You will know, of course,’ he said, tapping a discoloured fingernail on the table as if instructing a child, ‘that that book was salvaged from the ruins of Byzantium and brought to Italy at the command of Cosimo de Medici. So, if it is the same one, it rightly belongs in the hands of his great-great-great-granddaughter. Though it is considered a dangerous book, and forbidden by the Church.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Have you read it?’</p>
<p class="indented">He leaned forward, screwing up his face further to scrutinise me with his rheumy eyes, trying to divine whether I meant to catch him out.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Have <em class="calibre6">you</em>?’</p>
<p class="indented">I merely smiled in a manner I hoped he would find enigmatic. The truth was that the book had only been in my possession for less than a day before it was stolen from me (even now the memory of Sophia’s betrayal could make me grind my teeth involuntarily), but I already knew that the heart of it was written in a complex code as yet unbroken by scholars. Let Ruggieri believe I had cracked the encryption. Catherine would want to know the book’s content, after paying so much; it might enhance my value if she thought I was the only one who could read it. Besides, I felt confident that, given the time to make a proper study, I would succeed in deciphering the cramped handwriting that filled the ancient pages.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would not profane its secrets by discussing them with a man such as you,’ he said loftily, after a hesitation long enough to reassure me that he had not managed to penetrate the book’s mysteries.</p>
<p class="indented">‘A man such as me?’ I laughed. ‘Oh, come, Ruggieri – if you did not have Catherine’s protection they would have burned you for a witch long ago. You call yourself a scholar, but you are little better than a village wise-woman. Love-philtres and divination by guesswork, that is the extent of your occult wisdom.’</p>
<p class="indented">He half-raised himself out of the chair, leaning on both hands across the table. ‘Do not think yourself so far above me, Giordano Bruno. For all your degrees in philosophy and theology, I know you have studied natural magic too. Why else would you want that book? And do not think to mock me – my prophecies have shaped this kingdom—’ He broke off suddenly, as if stricken by a terrible premonition, and stared at the rolled charts in his hand until I coughed, bringing him back to himself. He squinted hard at me. ‘We are two sides of the same coin, you and I. Look – we are even wearing the same costume tonight. People would be hard pressed to tell between us.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If I had known, I would have worn something different. I would not wish to be mistaken for you,’ I said carefully. ‘By some woman you had made a tryst with, for instance.’</p>
<p class="indented">He gave a dry laugh. ‘Hardly a danger these days. I always come as the Doctor to a costume ball, everyone knows it. You should have recalled that. You being the one who professes the art of memory,’ he added, unable to resist the barb.</p>
<p class="indented">I was too preoccupied with the thought of my encounter with Léonie in the clearing to respond in kind. It had been almost completely dark, and I was standing outside the reach of her lantern; I could not know for certain whether she had seen my costume and spoken as she did because she had been waiting for a man dressed as the Doctor from the Commedia and assumed I was he. But it made no sense to think she had been expecting Ruggieri; he was Catherine’s man to the bone, he would be the last person to incite anyone to harm the King. I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes; I was tired and still blurry from drink, and my mind was making wild leaps without the aid of reason. I needed to rein it in and proceed logically.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Speaking of memory,’ I said casually, ‘do you remember the girl’s name? The one who sold you the book.’ I scratched at a splinter of wood on the table so as not to look overly interested.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She was trying to present herself as a boy, I recall. No one was fooled by that.’ He paused to pick a shred of meat from his remaining teeth. ‘When she finally admitted her deception, the name she gave was very ordinary. Something that made me suppose it was a false name too. Anne, perhaps? Jane? Mary?’</p>
<p class="indented">I tried to suppress my irritation. ‘Well, which?’</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head. ‘I never had the benefit of your lessons in memory, of course,’ he said, with a malicious little smile. ‘Might have been Mary.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And the surname?’ I asked, already knowing this was pointless.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Something like Gifford,’ he said, unexpectedly. ‘One of those peculiar English names.’</p>
<p class="indented">I sat up. ‘Mary Gifford. You are sure?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not how you knew her, I take it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She has had many names since I’ve known her.’</p>
<p class="indented">Ruggieri pulled at the points of his beard. ‘She sounds like a handful of trouble, Bruno. You must be made for each other.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stared into the fire, my thoughts scattered. Sophia Underhill. A boy called Kit. Mrs Kate Kingsley. And now Mary Gifford. At least I had a means to begin looking. Made for each other. There were times when I feared that might be true, and not in a comforting way.</p>
<p class="indented">Bells chimed the hour from a distant part of the palace. The candles burned low. I must have dozed a little, listening to the fading crackle of the fire and the sound of Ruggieri sucking the bones for the last scraps of meat. Eventually the chewing gave way to the rhythmic gargling of an old man’s snores. I roused myself and saw that he had fallen asleep, his head lolling on to his chest like a hanged man. I pushed my chair back and stood, as silently as possible. We were alone in the vast space of the library, wooden stacks filled with books stretching away into the darkness in both directions. I had no idea how much time had passed, but I decided that, whatever the consequences, I would rather not wait for Catherine’s summons. I picked up my mask from the table and tied it tight around my head again, flinching at the clamminess inside. Ruggieri might be deep in the arms of Morpheus but I supposed the guard was still outside and I was unarmed since the loss of my dagger. I cast around for anything I might use as a weapon and my eye fell on a poker in the fireplace. Tucking it behind my back, I tiptoed across to the door and turned the handle. Ruggieri shifted and snorted in his sleep; I froze, my throat tight, but he settled himself like an old dog and slumbered on. I slipped out, closing the door behind me and keeping my back pressed against it.</p>
<p class="indented">The guard looked surprised at my appearance; he gripped his halberd with both hands and demanded to know what I was about.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is time for me to return to the Queen Mother’s apartments,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">He frowned. ‘I was given no orders.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, but I was. She told me to return at this hour.’</p>
<p class="indented">He glanced along the corridor to left and right, as if some explanation might be waiting. I suspected this one was not overburdened with wits.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We don’t want to keep her waiting,’ I added, with a warning note. ‘She will be angry if she hears you stopped me.’</p>
<p class="indented">He hesitated. ‘I will have to accompany you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course. Is it down here?’ I took a step forward in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="indented">‘This way.’ He moved to usher me along, turning as he did so to point ahead; in the same moment I swung the poker with both hands to catch him on the back of the skull. He was a tall man, but not heavy; he fell on his face with a thud like a sack of flour dropped from a height, narrowly missing the blade of his weapon as he toppled forward. I murmured an apology as I fumbled at his belt for the short knife he carried there. It was a poor substitute for the beautifully crafted Damascus steel I had lost, but at least I felt a little better prepared. I ran along dim corridors where the sconces had burned down to one wavering flame on a mound of melted wax, winding my way through the now-deserted palace, keeping close to the walls, until a draught of cold air led me to a side door that opened on to the gardens.</p>
<p class="indented">A brittle dawn light was spreading slowly up from the horizon, the sky cold and smooth as glass, the air charged with the metallic taste of frost. A lone seagull drifted above me with a mournful cry, wings motionless, floating like a sheet of paper on the wind. Ahead, the gardens were emerging into a patchwork of shadows, the detritus of the night – abandoned masks, gloves, lanterns – outlined on the whitened grass. The bowl of the great fountain loomed out of the retreating darkness. The gardens too seemed abandoned; I guessed the night’s revellers had been packed off into boats before panic and scandal could spread too far.</p>
<p class="indented">I set out briskly on the path towards the copse, my feet so quickly numbed by the cold that it hurt to walk. The torches that had lit the way a few hours earlier had all burned to blackened stumps or been appropriated by couples seeking the shelter of the wood. I had no need of a lantern to find the place now, though when I reached the clearing where I had encountered Léonie, I wished I had thought to bring one; the trees overshadowed the ground and the frail light barely penetrated here. I walked carefully around the fallen trunk where she had been sitting, crouching to sift through piles of dead leaves with my fingers. After a few minutes, I sat back on my haunches and blew on my frozen fingers. It was still too dark to make out footprints clearly and in any case, so many lovers seemed to have made their way through the clearing I was unlikely to find anything that would show who had encountered Léonie here.</p>
<p class="indented">I stood, hearing my knees crack, and followed the direction she had taken in such haste when she realised she had said too much to the wrong person. She had run wildly into the trees where there was no path, but by proceeding slowly I could see from the broken branches and traces of her white fur cloak snagged on twigs the course of her panicked flight. Some fifty yards into the wood, my eye was caught by a pale streak on the ground. I pushed through the thicket of branches and bent to pick up a white silk scarf, sown with tiny pearls and embroidered with silver thread and tassels, now trampled and muddied. A knot had been tied midway along. I stared at it, recalling Léonie’s body, the bruise at her throat. Whoever killed her had known this trick with the knot, just like Joseph de Chartres’s murderer.</p>
<p class="indented">I tucked the scarf inside my doublet and stumbled back into the clearing, wrapping my hands inside the folds of my cloak. The sun had almost risen above the horizon; in the chilly light I saw a figure moving among the trees on the other side, by the path back to the palace. I froze, but a twig snapped beneath my feet and it was too late to hide; I drew the small dagger I had stolen as he whipped around and I realised he was not wearing a mask.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Jacopo!’ I sheathed the weapon with relief and pushed my own mask on to my head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Bruno?’ He took a step towards me, frowning. The pouches under his eyes were deeply shadowed; he had evidently been up all night too. ‘What on earth are you doing out here?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Looking for anything that might tell us what happened to the girl. You?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The same,’ he said, after a pause. I noticed that he looked past me towards the trees as he spoke. ‘I thought Catherine had you under guard in the library?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I thought I might spend my time more usefully.’</p>
<p class="indented">He glanced fearfully in the direction of the gardens. ‘She will be angry when she finds you gone.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ruggieri can take the blame for that. Though he will probably claim I bewitched him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you find anything?’</p>
<p class="indented">I unbuttoned my doublet and reached into the inside pocket. ‘I cannot tell you how glad I am to talk to you, Jacopo. There is something I must show you.’ I told him briefly of my earlier encounter with Léonie and what she had said, then handed him the gold medallion she had left behind. ‘She dropped this when she ran from me. I suppose it is valuable – she was worrying at it like a holy medal when I interrupted her.’</p>
<p class="indented">He started visibly as I laid the disc flat on his palm, the side with the dolphin engraving uppermost, and the colour drained from his face. ‘Dear God. Do you know what this is?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A piece of jewellery, I guessed. But I do not understand its significance.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Better you do not.’ He pressed his lips together and closed his fist over the medal. ‘Leave it with me – I will see it returned to its rightful owner. You must not be found with it on your person. In fact, you should not be found at all.’ He checked quickly in both directions. ‘Come with me. I helped smuggle you in – the least I can do is show you out. And God help us both if we run into anyone.’</p>
<p class="indented">I followed him back to the path, but instead of turning towards the palace, he led me in the other direction, along the edge of the wild part of the gardens in the shadow of the riverside wall, until we reached a small gate tucked away at the far end. Jacopo took a bunch of keys from his belt and unlocked it.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You can get a boat across the river from the steps at the Tour du Bois, there should be boatmen about at this hour,’ he said, chivvying me through. ‘And Bruno – tell no one else of what the girl said to you. Do not even mention that you saw her in the clearing. I told you before – it is safer for you to keep your distance from all this.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘All this? So you know that this murder is connected to the others?’</p>
<p class="indented">He laid a hand on my arm. ‘I know you believe so. Catherine told me what you said to Henri tonight, about Circe.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I heard the girl, Jacopo, only minutes before she died, protesting she could not go through with it or she would damn her soul. What else could she have meant? Someone had corrupted her to their cause to kill the King, I am certain of it. She must have confessed to Paul Lefèvre, who wrote anonymously to the King to warn him. Henri never received the letter, but whoever was behind the plot found out by some means. Paul was killed to silence him, so was Joseph. When it became clear that Léonie had lost her nerve, she too was silenced.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo looked at me with great weariness in his dark eyes, his face grave. ‘It sounds a wild theory to me, Bruno. But these deaths should be reason enough to leave the business alone. Let Catherine deal with it now as she judges best. Léonie de Châtillon was a member of her household.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Guise and his sister are behind it, I am certain. It is just a question of finding proof.’ I felt my fists clench as I spoke; I had almost forgotten my obligation to Guise. But I still could not fathom why he had set me on to investigate the previous murders if he knew the trail would lead back to his associates.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then you must certainly leave it to Catherine. She is practised in negotiating with the Duke of Guise – if he is responsible, she will find a way to have satisfaction.’ He darted a quick glance over his shoulder and squeezed my arm. ‘Now I must go. Promise me, Bruno, that you will not put yourself in any further danger?’</p>
<p class="indented">I laid my hand over his. ‘I can promise you that I will not take undue risk.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is not the same thing,’ he said, his eyes stern.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have been given a task by the King, and until he releases me from it I consider myself under royal command.’</p>
<p class="indented">He sighed. ‘Too stubborn, Bruno. One day it will be the end of you. The King is hardly himself at the moment, surely you can see that?’ When I said nothing, he shook his head with an air of paternal disappointment. ‘Go, then. But come and dine with me this week. I will send you word when I am free.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, I will.’ I pressed his hand. ‘One more question – are the <em class="calibre6">Gelosi</em> staying at your house this week?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘They will be there for today, collecting their belongings. Tomorrow they move to the Hotel de Montpensier – they have been offered rooms while they entertain the Duke tomorrow night. After that I believe they are bound for Lyon.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good. I want you to pass a message to Francesco. Tell him I need to take him up on his kind offer to join the company.’</p>
