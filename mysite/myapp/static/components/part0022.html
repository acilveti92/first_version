			<p class="bt-1st-para3">“You needn’t fret over spending the money on stocking up, my dear fellow.” Sherlock Holmes’s steely eyes darted momentarily to mine before he resumed his minute perusal of <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Echo.</span> “Elliot’s Fine Tobacco and Cigar Emporium is giving every indication of closing, I grant, but I have it on best authority that they merely mean to move to a more convenient shopfront round the corner on Broadstone Place.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How the devil did you know I meant to lay in a supply of their cigarettes?” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mrs. Hudson had just cleared away the egg cups and the curry dish from our simple breakfast and my friend sat across from me, peering down at his agony columns. It is possible only for one who has seen him at his worst, who has learnt the uncaring lassitude associated with narcotics and depression, to imagine the satisfaction which I glean from a Sherlock Holmes who not only has ample work at his nervous fingertips, but consents to eat and sleep when the work is through. He had not yet dressed, though his black hair was slicked back neatly, and, thanks to the influence of a hot cup of tea, he boasted very nearly the complexion of a normal human.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There was nothing noteworthy about the observation, I assure you. I smoke every incarnation of tobacco at a rate some have found altogether alarming, but you are more moderate in this as in all things and generally prefer a pipe or a cigar—when you buy tobacco, it used to be from Bradley’s in Oxford Street, a Virginia Arcadia mixture, and naturally they also supplied your cigarettes, which you needed to purchase only once a fortnight or so. Remarkable restraint, I found that figure—my cap was off to you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I made a seated bow, and he huffed appreciatively before continuing.</p>
			<p class="bt">“When I began frequenting Elliot’s owing to its proximity to Baker Street and its high-quality products, however, you discovered that Elliot’s offered a most enjoyable cigarette composed of a medium-bodied Turkish and Virginia blend. You tried it, and found it agreeable. Your cigarette consumption has increased by at least twenty-two percent since then, and ever since Elliot’s began posting ominous notices and discounted prices, you have peered at your case with more obvious alarm—as you did just now; twice, in fact—where it resides upon your desk. I hereby relieve you of your apprehensions: Elliot’s is not closing, merely relocating, and your filthy habits are quite safe.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, both I and my filthy habits thank you, in that case. But how did you know about the relocation?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, that took me to rarefied realms of abstract conjecture.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Might you explain them to the layman?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I asked the clerk at the register,” he drawled, and when our mirth over this answer had subsided, I poured us more tea and we settled back into convivial quiet.</p>
			<p class="bt">Elsewhere in my continuing efforts to chronicle the unique lifework of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have remarked that the year 1895 was one in which the fullest breadth and scope of his remarkable powers were required of him owing to the volume—and likewise the ­complexity—of cases supplicants placed in his capable hands. Thanks to this near-­continual exercise of his faculties, and lacking the significant gaps between exploits which I ever grimly regarded as the fetid pools wherein bred my noble companion’s darkest inclinations, Holmes was for the majority of that twelvemonth the very image of his own best self. Our final case of that year, which I here recount, reflected this change for the better—and though the logician in Holmes was taxed rather less than he would have wished, it nevertheless possessed many of the fantastical elements so dear to his dispassionate heart.</p>
			<p class="bt">My mind soon began to drift again after I finished my tea, though this time not to cigarettes. I had so far abused my newspaper as to allow its outer edge to sag against the still-exposed butter dish whilst my eyes lazily traced the patterns Jack Frost had wrought upon our sitting room windows the night previous, when my friend interrupted my reverie with a light cough.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ll want to finish dressing, Watson,” said he, this time without looking up.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Will I?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If my surmise that we two shall soon be entertaining a client proves correct, then yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What indications led you to surmise that, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“She made an appointment.” Winking at me, Holmes rose and pulled a sliver of stationery from the pocket of his dressing gown, passing it to me as he headed for his bedroom. “Just read that over, my dear fellow, and tell me we’re not in for a bit of merriment if nothing better.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I carried the letter with me upstairs, and as I did so, I attempted to make use of my friend’s methods in examining it; however, I could deduce only that the sender was a woman who used very cheap paper and resigned myself to the actual contents. These were bizarre enough to give me considerable pause.</p>
			<p class="ext"><span class="charoverride3">Dear Mr. Holmes,</span></p>
			<p class="ext1"><span class="charoverride3">Though Harold has said it’s no use and you won’t come, I paid him no mind, for I’ve read so very much about you and I know that a lofty imagination like yours must love nothing better than to marvel at scientific advances. Were you not the inventor of an infallible blood test, as Dr. Watson writes about in </span>A Study in Scarlet<span class="charoverride3">? What an immense achievement! My instinct tells me that we might well be kindred spirits in this love of experimental progress, though I admit I am only a participant and not the creative genius behind the study.</span></p>
			<p class="ext1"><span class="charoverride3">Still I rejoice at feeling a part of something greater than myself, and cannot but hope that the world’s most celebrated criminologist may share my tremendous enthusiasm! Therefore I pray that you’ll do us the honor of witnessing the first spiritualist ever to contact the dead by means of photochemical processes at the Winter Solstice 21st December. Harold claims a note won’t sway you but if you’ll consent to see us in person on the 18th</span><span class="charoverride3">, I’ll make all clear and you’ll be sure to agree to witness a miracle of modern innovation.</span></p>
			<p class="ext3"><span class="charoverride3">Your servant, expectantly,</span></p>
			<p class="ext4"><span class="charoverride3">Miss Constance Cooke</span></p>
			<p class="ext4"><span class="charoverride3">Bournemouth</span></p>
			<p class="ext5"><span class="charoverride3">Hampshire</span></p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">To say that this missive baffled me would be to do it scant justice. For, while my friend was himself a chemist of no paltry skill, his interest in the shadowlands where ghosts and shades abide was slightly less keen than his interest in the intricacies of the international stock market. In other words, always supposing such matters had no direct bearing upon a case of murder most foul, it vacillated between negligible and nonexistent. I have seen significant checks made out to <span class="charoverride3">Mr. S. Holmes</span> languish upon the sideboard in imminent danger of sopping up cold roast beef drippings rather than being invested, and my friend has just as readily faced down phosphorescent hellhounds as he has less spectral monsters.</p>
			<p class="bt">Thus it was that I wore a puzzled expression when I rejoined Holmes downstairs. He had donned a black frock coat and subdued grey check trousers and was lighting his pipe with the only dish warmer our landlady had failed to remove. A moment later Mrs. Hudson appeared and, pouncing, retrieved it with a muttered injunction that further conflagrations would be met with ill grace, and to think of her age, and of the Christmas season. Holmes bade her an unperturbed farewell as she disappeared once more.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why on earth have you agreed to see a pair of charlatan mediums?” I queried, waving the letter. “I am frankly shocked you haven’t already incinerated this appeal.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He shrugged, sending an ivory puff of smoke to mingle with the aroma of our crackling fireplace. “Where’s the harm? If they are honest—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You don’t believe that they’re honest.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Conversely, if they are dishonest—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You don’t care a fig about the armies of tea leaf readers and mesmerists and animal magnetism proponents littering our cities and coastal towns. Investigating a crime of that sort would be akin to your proving that objects fall toward the earth when under the influence of gravity—you would reproduce laughably predictable effects and surprise no one. Something concrete made you agree to this meeting. What was it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s grey eyes shone with suppressed laughter. “Good heavens, are you deducing me, Doctor?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t need to—I know you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The laugh escaped, but was stilled quickly. “The ink doesn’t match the paper.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Beg pardon?” I glanced down again at the note. Footsteps, one set heavier and one barely audible in its wake, sounded from the staircase; the performers were entering our small stage.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The script is written with a high-quality fountain pen, a Waterman turnup nib unless I deceive myself, but the paper is of the lowest quality,” Holmes said at a quieter volume. “It may prove irrelevant, but—Come in!”</p>
			<p class="bt">The man who pushed the door wide produced a premonition of vague distaste in me. Doubtless Holmes already knew his life history, but my lesser senses could report only that I would never have approached him at my club for a friendly game of billiards, even supposing the place deserted. He’d dark, meticulously oiled hair which curled gently about his collar, a vivid green waistcoat paired with fawn trousers, and a violet necktie stuck with a small jade stone. Above his smooth chin hovered a hearty and expressive moustache, a scholarly complexion, and a pair of calculating blue eyes which narrowed at the sight of us. All of this ought to have conveyed nothing to me save neutral interest—and yet there was a hint of a roll at his self-satisfied jaw, and a paunch at his affectedly sucked-in waist, that made me suppose him less than forthright about the image he had cultivated.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Harold Slaymaker,” he announced himself, diving forward to shake Holmes’s hand. “I could hardly credit the honor conferred when my fiancée here informed me you’d agreed to meet. A pleasure, Mr. Holmes, and a thrill, if I may say so without embarrassing either of us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“This is my friend, Dr. Watson,” Holmes replied in a neutral tone, though I could see that his half-lidded eyes were absorbing every detail of the stranger’s manner and dress. “We may suppose him equally as thrilled as I am to meet you. My name is Sherlock Holmes, as you say, and I was happy to grant the lady’s request.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am Miss Constance Cooke,” the young woman said in a voice like a songbird’s earnest warbling, “and <span class="charoverride3">so</span> gratified to meet you both, Mr. Holmes . . . Dr. Watson.”</p>
			<p class="bt">As our guests seated themselves following a brief nod from Holmes, I studied Miss Cooke, for her appearance was such as to arrest the most disinterested observer. Her features were delicate, nearly elfin, all save for enormous wide-set eyes of darkest ocean blue which glistened even in the humble winter lamplight of Baker Street. Her figure was modeled on a similarly petite scale, dressed in an ivory wool traveling costume which lacked trimmings and verged upon the threadbare, but her hair—never have I seen such an ethereal nebula of pale gold, nearly white curls. Though pinned beneath a small straw hat, it swept out in a delirious arc at the edges, giving Miss Cooke an air that was a remarkable blend of the angelic and the puckish. When I met her lustrous eyes, I found their expression charming and frank, but could see little beyond that despite the depth of their color. I would not go so far as to call Miss Cooke vapid, but I had no difficulty in matching her demeanor with the breezy tone of her note.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Congratulations are in order, I gather, Miss Cooke,” Holmes said, surprising me by bending over her hand in a gesture which might have appeared courtly had I not been certain he was examining the ring which adorned that appendage. He then settled into his armchair with his long legs crossed before him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh!” she exclaimed, smiling. “Thank you, sir. You are too kind. The wedding was to be a quiet affair some three months ago, only a few family present at the courthouse and then a nice, friendly celebration at our new home. My sister readily agreed to help with the cooking, and my aunt with the flowers, but these ceremonies incur so <span class="charoverride3">very </span>many unseen costs, you understand. Harold thought it best if we wait until his financial situation is more stable, following the publication of his remarkable discovery.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Her speech was delivered in an innocent, rambling fashion which entirely belied my earlier assumption that she was scheming to deceive us. Miss Cooke, I suspected, could not have deceived us if her life depended upon the quest.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You mentioned a photochemical process?” I queried.</p>
			<p class="bt">“She did—Constance is always bolstering my spirits, but through no trial has she ever been more supportive. Our very presence here proves her dedication! This is indeed a great breakthrough, following years of labor,” put in Harold Slaymaker. “But just listen to me, talking quite unlike a scientist—I suppose I had better tell it to you from the beginning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The beginning is often an admirable place to start.” Holmes sighed, his eyes falling shut as he took a contemplative draft of shag.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, and my own starting point must of needs be ancestral. I come from a family highly sensitive to the spirit world,” Mr. Slaymaker explained with an air of rueful gravity, as of a man thrust into an avocation by fate, “though the pedestrian methodology my kinfolk employ would likely not appeal to you, Mr. Holmes. Some might call their techniques crude, and others . . . Well, I hesitate to repeat what others have called them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Harold’s aunt is a <span class="charoverride3">very</span> well-known communicator with the inhabitants of the afterlife. She reads tarot in Poole to universal acclaim,” the young lady put in enthusiastically, “and people come from great distances to hear her and see her paranormal collection. She has photographs of spirits that must be seen to be credited, lamps possessing <span class="charoverride3">quite </span>unusual characteristics, and a seemingly ordinary sewing needle which can unfailingly divine whether or not a party is telling the truth. And then, Harold’s sister is celebrated the world over for her scrying ball, and his cousin George—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Constance, Mr. Holmes needn’t be bothered with my <span class="charoverride3">entire</span> family history. They are enthusiasts, if you will, but hardly scientists,” Slaymaker added regretfully to the pair of us. “They possess a certain talent for detecting emanations, granted. But the dazzling effects they attempt to achieve—all too successfully—class them with the sort of quack prognosticators who give the rest of us a bad name. My own work is a far more meticulous business.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And that is?” Holmes inquired pointedly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The conjuring of <span class="charoverride3">spectres,</span>” Miss Cooke breathed. “Or, rather, <span class="charoverride3">the </span>spectre. Eva Rayment, the Lightless Maiden of Bournemouth.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Harold Slaymaker proceeded to tell us an extravagant tale I expected at every moment to be challenged by an irate Sherlock Holmes, but the sleuth sat placidly in his chair all the while. Whether my friend’s toleration of the ghost story or the ghost story itself was more incredible, I could not begin to guess.</p>
			<p class="bt">In the seventeenth century, or so local legend had it, the first Rayments came to reside in Bournemouth, and they built a sprawling turreted estate in the densely wooded forest half a mile from the restless seaside. They were recalled as a noble but unhappy strain, much beset by tragedy. Since then, the Rayment clan had all but dried up in those parts, and poor investments made by the modern namesake had caused what was once a fine English manor house to fall into rude dereliction. It was nevertheless known far and wide along the coastline for the wild beauty of its decay, and for the extreme likelihood that spirits occupied its every attic and pantry. Its residents had long since scattered to various country homes and metropolitan lodgings, but anyone might make a tour appointment via the estate agent, for the Rayments in London hoped to sell the place before it was reduced to so much romantic rubble.</p>
			<p class="bt">A century ago, when the family seat was still rich with stained glass and gilt-spined tomes and stately tapestries, a hapless but lovely child had been born to the dwindling family. The mysterious little girl was named Eva Rayment, and from her birth she gained a reputation in the surrounding countryside for extreme eccentricity and seclusion. I attempted to mask a pleasant chilling of the blood as I listened—for whatever else Mr. Slaymaker and Miss Cooke were, they made an admirable pair of storytellers, and my fingers soon itched for a pen. The only glimpses caught of Miss Eva were in the murk of twilight, when she would from time to time practice chasing a hoop across the yard after the sun had slipped silently away, or paint the last of the clouds before they melted darkly into so much night sky. She was seldom if ever viewed in daylight, so said the villagers—and if she did appear riding with her governess, she was always swathed from head to toe in gloves and a thick black veil, no matter what the weather.</p>
			<p class="bt">“When I first heard of Miss Eva, I thought her biography the fancy of some marvelous antique raconteur, but you see, all this had a perfectly <span class="charoverride3">logical</span> explanation,” Miss Cooke impressed upon us.</p>
			<p class="bt">“She was cursed with a violent aversion to sunlight,” Mr. Slaymaker explained. “From the moment her parents discovered the illness, they put every possible precaution in place to ensure her safety, essentially imprisoning her—to no avail in the end, I fear. It’s a tragic account. Eva Rayment died a maid of twenty after having suffered a fall from her horse during a very early morning ride. By the time help reached her after the day had broken, the burns were so severe that nothing could be done.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Sun poisoning,” said I, when a skeptical sliver of Holmes’s gaze flicked in my direction. “A rare enough allergy, and a deadly enough affliction in the severest cases, though most outbreaks of accidental exposure can be ameliorated through application of Saint-John’s-wort poultice or lemon oil to reduce swelling. Extraordinary. I know of its existence, but I’ve never encountered a patient suffering from the syndrome. All are highly reclusive, and the most sensitive often die from some similar misadventure at a young age.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But you <span class="charoverride3">will</span> meet one, Dr. Watson!” exclaimed Miss Cooke. “You will when you accompany us to Bournemouth for the summoning, for she haunts her former home, and I am like her twin come back from the grave, Harold showed me, and when the photochemical process is—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A little slower,” Holmes said with a palm raised, “and with better sense.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Swallowing, she nodded, fair curls all aquiver as Mr. Slaymaker cast her an indulgent glance. “A painting of Eva Rayment hangs in the hall of one of the only habitable wings of the estate. You have no cause to credit me until you’ve seen it for yourselves, but it’s like looking into a mirror with my face staring back! Harold took me to make a comparative study, and <span class="charoverride3">oh.</span> The likeness—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How long had you been acquainted with Mr. Slaymaker at that time, Miss Cooke?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How long? I believe it must have been about a fortnight.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes did not bother to hide a frown. “Indeed. Rather a grotesque outing, but between Mr. Slaymaker’s scientific exploits and the active interests of his immediate family, you must have heard plentiful tales of the supernatural by that time.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, I’ve never met Harold’s family, Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No?” my friend said, his languid yet powerful focus aimed square at Mr. Slaymaker.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Estrangement is always painful, but they are carnival barkers and shell game enthusiasts,” the fellow answered, spreading his hands wide. “I am a scientist. We are divided upon the subject, I fear. Resentment upon their side, disapproval upon mine.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes turned his attention back to the lady. “You say that you resemble the late Miss Eva?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Uncannily,” she returned with pride. “She walks along the edges of the forests and the seashore often, lamenting that she died without ever having loved. Many of the locals have seen her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And have you?” Holmes inquired blandly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have sometimes thought so, when the moon was full. Harold, though, always says that I must trust only in <span class="charoverride3">reproducible</span> effects, and I always become so flustered when I fancy I really have glimpsed her that I can never swear so to his professional satisfaction. It is a failing I’m attempting to remedy.” She blushed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You did not grow up in Bournemouth, Miss Cooke.” My friend failed to phrase this as a question.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why do you say that?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Because if the likeness is truly so uncanny, and the legend so widespread, someone would have compared you to Eva Rayment long before Mr. Slaymaker here.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, I see! To think I already <span class="charoverride3">know </span>how clever you are, and still questioned you. Forgive me. Yes, my kin live to the west, in Wareham, but I relocated to Bournemouth after being engaged as a typist for Mr. Tiberius Clark, who runs a local law office there. He didn’t want a London girl, and I needed the position badly, Mr. Holmes, in order to help support my immediate family. My parents are not well. . . . My aunt assists with the housekeeping, and my mother’s condition is poorly enough that my sister may as well be a full-time nurse. I was so lonesome there at first, away from them, but very soon after my arrival I encountered Harold down on the promenade.” She beamed at him. “After that glad occasion, I never felt solitary and neglected again. We have been very happy together.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“She does me tremendous honor to say so,” Mr. Slaymaker returned, kissing her hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Conversely you, Mr. Slaymaker, are a native,” Holmes surmised. “Though your accents are very similar, as I said, so strong a resemblance to a famous local legend could not have eluded Miss Cooke had she been raised there, whereas you revealed the likeness to her within two weeks’ acquaintance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are perfectly correct, Mr. Holmes, and I must make a confession to you: the tale has long held a strange fascination for me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah. What is its connection to your chemical researches, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There we hit upon the crux of the matter! I have been devising a method by which ghosts that exist on a plane invisible to us might be compelled to manifest themselves. Countless scholars have postulated that spirits linger in the astral realm owing to lack of completion—be it a regret, an act of vengeance unfinished, a lost love, or in Miss Eva’s case, a sad dearth of true fulfillment in the world while living. Leaving all of that aside, however, I am after much harder data. Granted, there is an emotional variable to my work, a psychic energy if you will, but my studies mainly revolve around particular spectrums of light.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Harold is a genius,” Miss Cooke averred.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Constance, pray don’t unduly flatter me, or they shall think us all bluster and no substance,” Mr. Slaymaker admonished her somewhat tersely.</p>
			<p class="bt">I already found myself recoiling from the praise this tender creature was heaping upon a man whose theories seemed to me so much chaff in the wind, but I positively dreaded the moment when Holmes would disabuse their treasured illusions and throw them both out on their ears. However, I had again misjudged him, for he leaned forward with a welcoming eye and his elbows resting upon his knees.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Describe for me, Miss Cooke, the methods Mr. Slaymaker employs,” Holmes requested.</p>
			<p class="bt">Rising slowly, she advanced to the fireplace and then turned to face the room.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I dress in a costume of the last century, a pale chemise lined with silver with a white sleeveless robe—every detail perfect, every thread <span class="charoverride3">exact.</span>” She glanced from one to the other of us, scarce able to contain her excitement. “It is always the full moon when we attempt contact, for the light is best then for Harold’s methods, and in any case, it is such a <span class="charoverride3">spiritual</span> time, don’t you agree? I walk the paths along the edges of the forest,” and here she stepped gracefully forward; “and when I reach a clearing, I cease moving and simply <span class="charoverride3">bathe</span> myself in light.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Miss Cooke stopped, eyes closed as if in rapture, and held her palms open at her sides in the middle of our sitting room. Mr. Slaymaker looked rapt, I disbelieving, while Holmes’s brows dived toward his superior nose as if he were growing unaccountably angry. I could not fathom why he had allowed the charade to continue for so long—he certainly expected no otherworldly revelation, and surely he had determined very quickly that Miss Cooke believed every nonsensical word she was telling us. My friend and I both have threadbare patience where villains are concerned; but whimsical fools are another matter entirely.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I remain motionless for long periods, hoping that Eva Rayment will see me—will see <span class="charoverride3">herself</span> as she could have been, flooded in illumination which cannot harm her,” Miss Cooke whispered with her eyes peacefully shut. “Oh, it is <span class="charoverride3">so </span>difficult to remain calm at such moments, but Harold has told me that spirits see our world only poorly, and that we must be still. In the meanwhile, he produces light from the dim of the woods, light of a spectrum to appeal to her, and often I sense a . . . a presence lingering at the edges of my closed lids. I can practically feel the glow of her, as I have mentioned, though thus far she has never spoken to us. But she will!” the young lady cried, opening her eyes and clasping her small hands together. “The full moon may be insufficiently powerful, but when it coincides with Winter Solstice, as it will on the twenty-first, Mr. Holmes—oh, <span class="charoverride3">won’t</span> you come?”</p>
			<p class="bt">And here, I again supposed, all would come crashing to a spectacular halt, for traveling from London to Bournemouth to witness a ludicrous scientific charade would prove distasteful enough to my methodical-minded friend as to cause physical pain. Meanwhile Sherlock Holmes rose, walked to his desk, and drew out his appointment book.</p>
			<p class="bt">“December the twenty-first it is,” he announced with a dazzling smile. “We shall be very pleased to meet you at Bournemouth. By the way, Miss Cooke, did Mr. Slaymaker here assist you in any way with your original letter?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh! You know so much, Mr. Holmes, quite as much as Harold here, and I must cease being so surprised at it. Why, he was paying a call on me when I wrote to you, and I asked to borrow his pen, for it works so nicely, but the sentiments were entirely my own, I assure you,” she replied.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have not the slightest doubt of it. And now, as we’ve other pressing matters to attend to, I will wish you both an agreeable afternoon. You may expect us in Bournemouth on the twenty-first without fail.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When our guests had departed, I turned to Holmes in open astonishment.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,” he said before I had managed to form a question.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But not by their summoning!” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No indeed,” he concurred, gliding into his bedroom and emphatically shutting the door behind him.</p>
			<p class="btspace">Bournemouth railway station and the entrance to its sloping, well-­maintained pier must have been a merry sight in the summertime, what with the clock tower’s many delicate spires, the low red bathhouses, the buggies for daily rental, and the sun skimming the salt froth that bubbled tenderly against the pale sand of the beach beyond. Had it been July, I’ve no doubt whatsoever I should have been charmed. It was nightfall in December, however, and no matter how cold London may grow, it does not plummet in temperature as does the wind sweeping off the cutting waves of the ocean. My jaw was set against its onslaught, and Sherlock Holmes shot me a significant look as we bypassed unpaved lanes lined with sea grass to rendezvous with our questionably sane clients.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You think me frivolous,” he observed, though there was no pique in his tone.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes, I have never known you to be so, and do not intend to start now.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then you think me credulous, which is worse.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not at all. I may perhaps think you secretive, and close-mouthed, but then I have always thought so; therefore doubtless you are well used to the sensation.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My researches in the past few days have proved most fruitful,” said he insistently. “A final link finishes my chain. Of course I will reveal all to you when the time is right—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course,” I agreed drily.</p>
			<p class="bt">“—But I have no wish to perjure myself when the possibility remains that I could be mistaken.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I knew better than to push him further, and so we walked with a purpose to a rise just above the shoreline, and a yellow-painted pub with a dull grey awning. While a barren enough place during the off season, it did command an enchanting view of the stark winter tides and the slow-spiraling silhouettes of gulls in the desolate distance. Smells of fried fish and spilled ale assaulted my nostrils as we entered the creaky building.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes!” Harold Slaymaker called, jumping up from a low wooden table. Beside him rested a large carpetbag, presumably containing his apparatus. His clever face reflected both gratitude and apprehension, and his sweeping moustache leaped with excitement. “We hardly dared hope that you would really come. Welcome, welcome! Constance, is this not a dream come true?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Miss Cooke sat beside her fiancé, wrapped in a long wool cloak beginning to fray at its edges, and her whimsical sprite’s face glowed at the sight of us. “Oh, how splendid! I <span class="charoverride3">told </span>you they would keep their word—I could feel it. Now it will be worth it, Harold, you shall see.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My opinion regarding whether or not the expedition would prove worthwhile must have been briefly evident upon my features, for Holmes delivered me a meaningful kick below the table just after we seated ourselves. Our clients had finished their modest pints, and Holmes made no overture to arrest the attention of the barman.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Miss Cooke, Mr. Slaymaker, the weather is hardly congenial to this sort of trial,” he announced. “Had you not best postpone—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But weather during the Winter Solstice will never be ‘congenial,’ Mr. Holmes,” Miss Cooke chided him sweetly. “Let us brave the elements in the cause of science—after all, I bear the brunt of the work during the event itself, and I am eager to start. You can see for yourself! Oh, <span class="charoverride3">do </span>let’s be off.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If you are set on this course, I cannot dissuade you,” Holmes replied. “But you will answer for it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">To my pronounced disquiet, he addressed Slaymaker, and in a warning tone which threatened grave consequences. But Slaymaker either did not hear or did not heed, for thirty seconds later we were outdoors, tramping through lip-numbing winter gusts toward a nearby copse, the charming ring of distant trees blasted by the cold and the saline mists of December. In the dimming half-light, they appeared cursed objects rather than merely natural wildlife, though in truth bowed by the elements, not by a centuries-old hex.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, if there is something you are not telling me that could have a direct bearing upon Miss Cooke’s well-being, now is the time to bare your soul, regardless of your flair for the dramatic,” I whispered.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Never fear, Watson,” he replied in clipped tones. “She is in no immediate danger.” This reassured me, but I could shake neither my agitation nor the cold which had sunk its talons into my bones.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we had reached a narrow path with a good view of the gentle, sandy slope which divided the mournful forest and the beach, Miss Cooke turned to me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Will you be so good as to hold my cloak, sir?” she inquired. “Harold will have his hands quite full producing the necessary light.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Reluctantly, I acquiesced. A small garland of flowers adorned her crown, and she wore the archaic clothing she had described to us at Baker Street, pale wrists gleaming brittle as ice shards in the gloom. I could have thought her a portrait study from a sentimental artist’s brush, all fey glimmers and ethereal coiffure. Miss Cooke wasted not a moment, but walked slowly toward the copse, adopting the same reverent posture she had used when enacting the scene at Baker Street.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a vision she is,” Slaymaker exclaimed softly. “If this doesn’t summon the Lightless Maiden, my researches must be reevaluated comprehensively. No man of my devotion to pure logic can possibly wish for luck at such a time, and yet I find I can’t help myself. Excuse me, gentlemen, but I will be only a dozen yards or so off—the powder I employ to reveal any spirits present is extremely delicate.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I shall never forget it. There stood Holmes and myself, arms folded into our breasts and necks tucked into thick scarves, watching the lady slowly advance upon the trees. To our right hovered Harold Slaymaker, readying what looked to me like a flat pan and a simple flash charge. The moon by now shone in earnest, painting the crests of the waves as white as Miss Cooke’s chemise, as white as the curve of her shoulder where the robe had slipped, and it shone full upon her when she suddenly reached up and began to unfasten the locks of her hair.</p>
			<p class="bt">Ivory curls billowing, Constance Cooke neared the tree line. Slowly, almost mesmerically, she pivoted, turning her palms upward as if she were an Egyptian queen worshipping the sun thousands of years in the past. Several chemical flashes went off in our periphery and we perceived that Harold Slaymaker was illuminating the scene in brilliant punctuations. I sensed my friend stiffen beside me, and indeed I knew not what to make of such a seemingly fruitless tableau. I knew only that Constance Cooke’s tiny features and her wide cobalt eyes, grey now in the moonlight, were beautiful, and that she must have been suffering terribly from the cold.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Enough of this travesty,” Holmes snapped, turning upon his heel.</p>
			<p class="bt">Hastening after him, entirely confounded, I paused when I heard Slaymaker’s shout from behind us. I glanced back to see Miss Cooke—no longer an apparition, merely a disappointed girl—now standing on the sand path, marking our departure with dismay. My friend never hesitated, however, abandoning the scene as if fleeing blindly might prevent his transformation into a pillar of salt.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, please,” I urged him. Gaining no reply, I gripped his elbow. “Is that poor young woman at risk? If there is a crime in contemplation—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No crime in the smallest,” he snarled, “save for the crime of being an utterly callous creature humanity at large would be well rid of.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Wait, but,” I stammered, “you cannot mean that Miss Cooke—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Harold Slaymaker is a disgrace to the species.” Holmes cast a ­minute glance at my bad leg and then continued at a much more measured speed toward the train station. “I can tell you without fear of hyperbole, Watson, I <span class="charoverride3">dearly </span>wish that were a punishable crime. As it happens, however, all we gain is confirmation of what I suspected from the first—that I can do less than I would like to. I will do <span class="charoverride3">something,</span> though. You may take me at my word that he will pay. Apologies for dragging you out on such a night, but I had to be certain of my facts. Shall I find a serviceable inn, or are you hale enough for us to cart ourselves back to London?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, certainly—I’m no more frozen than you are and considerably less so than Miss Cooke. But Holmes, what are we to do?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We are to return to our fireplace, my dear fellow, and hot toddies, and stimulating conversation, and every good thing two gentlemen require when their daily toil is at an end. And tomorrow,” he added on a growl, “I shall do several other things. They will give me, I can say with complete confidence, enormous pleasure in the execution.”</p>
			<p class="bt">If Holmes indeed contemplated his future activities with pleasure, his face did not reflect as much on the train ride home—he alternately scowled and fidgeted, and it was not until Baker Street and the welcome refreshments he had mentioned that I was able to get another word out of him at all.</p>
			<p class="btspace">I heard nothing more of the Slaymaker case for two days, though in my worry I pressed Holmes multiple times upon the subject and he curtly informed me that the lady would come to no harm. In fact, Christmas had been and gone before Holmes one sleet-plagued afternoon approached me at my writing desk with an envelope in his slim hand. It was postmarked from Poole, addressed to my friend, and unopened.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Go on,” he said, delivering it to my grasp. “I know the contents already, so you might as well do the honors.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Thinking here at last was the key to the mystifying Lightless Maiden affair, I slit through the seal. I could hardly contain a gasp when a confusion of cheaply printed photographs spilled onto my desk.</p>
			<p class="bt">A mass of pictures, the sort of penny postcards one finds so often at the seashore, lay scattered across a manuscript I had hesitantly titled “The Lone Cyclist.” They showed a ghostly figure bordered by tree line and by tidal break, in several similar poses, the very image of Miss Cooke as we had seen her on the night of the Winter Solstice. It was as if the ghost of Eva Rayment had indeed been captured—no doubt providing a ready profit in the tourist trade. My face swiveled up to Holmes in astonishment.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, come Watson, <span class="charoverride3">really,</span>” he pleaded, leaning against my desk. “You wound me. This is altogether too much. I shall give you thirty seconds to think, and then I despair of you entirely.”</p>
			<p class="bt">As it happened, I did not require thirty seconds. I required only ten.</p>
			<p class="bt">“That brute Slaymaker was photographing her,” I cried, slamming my hand down upon the penny postcards. “She was a stranger to Bournemouth, and the legend inspired him to make use of her for profit! He costumed her, he wished the moon to be full when they experimented, he created flash effects to enhance the light, he enjoined her to be still—all the while, he must have had an accomplice hidden in the brush with a camera.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Certainly not on the night we visited, for I should have heard any other party in the bracken. But on the previous occasions—yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, the cad, to use her for his own devices so! It’s positively deplorable, Holmes. Where did you get these?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“From his kith and kin in the shell game industry, with whom he claims to brook no commerce. They do a brisk mail-order business as well as a promenade trade. Finding these was child’s play.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How did you know at first?” I asked eagerly, turning my chair to face him. “Here, at Baker Street. Why did you agree to visit Bournemouth?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have never lost my heart to a woman, Watson,” Holmes answered with only a hint of irony, “but had I done so, and that woman lived practically in rags, buying ha’penny foolscap for letters to her parents and sending all her income home to tend to them, I should not postpone our nuptials pending the outcome of an imaginary scientific experiment. I should wed her, and thereby improve her lot in life. And despite my marked lack of sentiment, neither would I buy her an engagement ring made of <span class="charoverride3">brass,</span> when I possessed such expensive taste in writing implements.”</p>
			<p class="bt">A bitter silence fell. Staring down at the postcards, I shook my head.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I already wrote to Miss Cooke, and enclosed one of these pictures as proof.” Holmes rose, clapping me on the shoulder as he made for his armchair.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You did?” I repeated incredulously.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes seated himself and made a long arm for his Stradivarius bow.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I always rather regretted that Mary Sutherland business,” he confessed softly. “She was my client, after all, and I never told her that she had been courted by her own stepfather. I can’t think what I feared at the time—a scene, a scandal, an inconvenient hour? That she would prefer to disbelieve such a sordid charge than to trust me? That she would be hurt by it? Appalling cowardice, my dear fellow. I may have put the fear of God into Mr. Windibank, but I went no further, whether owing to pure negligence or apprehension over Miss Sutherland’s reaction I honestly can’t say. But whether she would have fainted or wept or railed or called me a liar doesn’t signify. What would any of those eventualities have mattered when set against her life, and dreams of bettering it? I hope, in vain perhaps, that I am a stouter fellow today. Miss Cooke and Miss Sutherland may be intellectual equals, but that does not mean they deserve to be duped.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It does not,” I agreed, smiling.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes was balancing the end of the bow on one fingertip, making tiny adjustments but sparing an instant to glance at me. “I cannot fathom what you are thinking just now.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Truly?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I assure you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It has been a very good year, my dear fellow. That is all. A most excellent, wonderful year.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes was just then distracted by a complex matter of coordination and dexterity. But he flashed a grin at me, and I knew that he had understood me entirely.</p>
