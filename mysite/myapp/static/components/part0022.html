In the late afternoon they saw a silver Mitsubishi Pajero SUV parked by the building. A man in a black suit, with a smartly trimmed beard, got out of the vehicle and entered the house. He was not accompanied by bodyguards. The agents posted on the street whispered in their <span class="ref-pnum">miniature</span> transmitters that “the man” had arrived in Damascus and he was on his way to the apartment. They knew that the man in black was about to meet his secret lover, a Syrian woman, who was waiting for him in the apartment. The man was carrying a present for her: she celebrated her thirtieth birthday that week.</p><p id="p1460" class="text-indent">The lovers spent a few hours in the luxurious apartment that was left at their disposal by Rami Makhlouf, a successful businessman and the cousin of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad.</p><p id="p1461" class="text-indent">Shortly before ten <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>., the man in black left the building and got into the silver Pajero. He was on his way to a meeting in a discreet safe house, <a id="pagebreak-rw_292"></a>in the Kafr Soussa neighborhood, where he met with Iranian, Syrian, and Palestinian envoys.</p><p id="p1462" class="text-indent">According to the London <em class="calibre7">Sunday Express</em>, the agents following him checked an updated photo of the man on the screens of their mobile phones to make sure there would be no identification mistake. They kept open lines of transmission and reported every move of the “mark” to Mossad’s <span class="ref-pnum">command</span> post.</p><p id="p1463" class="text-indent">When he left the building, where he had spent a few hours, the agents had a good opportunity to check his face against the photos on their screens. They confirmed the identification to their colleagues in Damascus and to headquarters in Tel Aviv. An overwhelming tension swept Mossad. The <span class="ref-pnum">department</span> heads gathered in Meir Dagan’s office, where all the necessary equipment was set up for monitoring the operation in real time.</p><p id="p1464" class="text-indent">The man started the silver Pajero.</p><p id="p1465" class="text-indent">“He’s on his way,” whispered one of the agents into his miniature mike.</p><p id="p1466" class="text-indent">The man in the silver Pajero was Imad Mughniyeh, who had left a bloody trail, years-long, behind him.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line98"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara135">November 15, 2001.</p><p id="p1467" class="text-indent">Following the attack on the Twin Towers, the FBI publishes a large poster containing the list of the most-wanted terrorists in the world.</p><p id="p1468" class="text-indent">The poster is stamped with the logos of the FBI, the State Department, and the Department of Justice.</p><p id="p1469" class="text-indent">The list shows twenty-two names and twenty-two pictures.</p><p id="p1470" class="text-indent">The first name is the most dangerous of them all.</p><p id="p1471" class="text-indent">The award for his capture is $5 million.</p><p id="p1472" class="text-indent">Until the attack on the Twin Towers, he had been considered as <span class="ref-pnum">responsible</span> for the deaths of more Americans than any other living terrorist.</p><p id="p1473" class="text-indent">Imad Mughniyeh.</p><p id="p1474" class="text-indent">April 18, 1983—bombing of the American embassy in Beirut, Lebanon—63 dead.</p><p id="p1475" class="text-indent">October 23, 1983—bombing of the U.S. Marines headquarters in Beirut—241 dead.</p><p id="p1476" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_293"></a>October 23, 1983 (same day)—bombing of the French paratrooper headquarters in Beirut—58 dead.</p><p id="p1477" class="text-indent">And the abduction and murder of CIA official William Buckley; several attacks on the American embassy in Kuwait; hijacking of a TWA airliner and two planes of the Kuwait airline; the murder of Colonel W.

He evaded photographers and refused to be interviewed. The Western secret services knew a lot about his activities, but almost nothing about his outward <span class="ref-pnum">appearance</span>, his habits, and his hideouts. They knew he was born in 1962, in a South Lebanon village. According to the fragmentary reports, his parents were devoted Shiites; while in his teens, he had moved to Beirut and grown up in a poor neighborhood mostly populated by Palestinians, supporters of the PLO. He had dropped out of high school and joined the Fatah, the terrorist branch of the PLO. Later he had become the <span class="ref-pnum">bodyguard</span> of Abu Ayad, Arafat’s deputy, and became a member of Force 17, <a id="pagebreak-rw_294"></a> the special security unit of the Fatah organization that was formed in the mid-seventies and commanded by Ali Hassan Salameh, the Red Prince (see chapter 12). But in 1982, Israel launched the Lebanon war, called Operation Peace for Galilee, invaded Lebanon, and crushed the PLO. Its surviving members, headed by Yasser Arafat, were exiled to Tunisia. <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh</span>, though, decided to stay behind and joined the first group of Hezbollah founders.</p><p id="p1484" class="text-indent">Hezbollah—literally, the Party of God—was a Shiite terrorist <span class="ref-pnum">organization</span> created in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Inspired by the Ayatollah Khomeini, trained and supplied by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Hezbollah became Israel’s sworn enemy, defining its main goal as “Israel’s final departure from Lebanon as a prelude to its final obliteration.” From the first day of its existence, Hezbollah engaged in violent acts of terrorism against Israel. And Mughniyeh was an ideal recruit for the nascent group.</p><p id="p1485" class="text-indent">As a real man of shadows, he chose to operate in secret and refrained from appearing in public. The reports about him became fragmentary and often contradictory. One source described him as the bodyguard of Sheikh Fadlallah, Hezbollah’s spiritual leader—while another claimed he had <span class="ref-pnum">become</span> the operations chief of the organization, the brain behind <span class="ref-pnum">Hezbollah’s</span> most risky actions, which ended in bloodbaths. Unlike the present Hezbollah leader, the Sheikh Nasrallah, Mughniyeh never appeared on television and never made hateful speeches; but in reality he was far more dangerous than the loquacious sheikh. He soon rose to the position of the most efficient and most elusive terrorist in the world, like Carlos in his time, and like his colleague and great admirer Osama bin Laden.</p><p id="p1486" class="text-indent">Mughniyeh was a cruel and creative terrorist. He emerged suddenly, when he planned and commanded several mass massacres in Lebanon, at the end of Operation Peace for Galilee. He was only twenty-one years old on this day in October 1983, when he sent explosive-laden trucks, driven by suicide bombers, to the compounds of the American Marines and the French paratroopers in Beirut; a few days later, he repeated the same <span class="ref-pnum">scenario</span> against the IDF headquarters in Tyre. At twenty-two, he led a group <a id="pagebreak-rw_295"></a>of terrorists on an attack against the fortified American embassy in Kuwait and afterward hijacked his first plane there. After each of his operations, he vanished into thin air. At twenty-three, Mughniyeh hijacked a TWA plane on its way from Athens to Rome and forced its pilot to land in Beirut <span class="ref-pnum">airport</span>. During the hijacking, he murdered navy diver Robert Dean Stethem and threw his body out the cockpit door. Mughniyeh escaped after the hijacking operation that lasted seventeen days, but this time he left behind a memento: his fingerprint in the aircraft restroom.</p><p id="p1487" class="text-indent">Almost nothing was known about his private life, except for his <span class="ref-pnum">marriage</span> to his cousin, who gave him a son and a daughter. At a very early age, he knew he was in the crosshairs of several Western secret services, and tried to conceal his identity. He went through a rudimentary plastic <span class="ref-pnum">surgery</span> in Libya, grew a beard, and stayed out of the limelight. Only a single confirmed photo of Mughniyeh—fat, bearded, wearing glasses and a visor cap—made its way to the Western services. His description was flawed as well—the FBI portrayed him as “born in Lebanon, speaking Arabic, brown hair and beard, height 5’8” (170 centimeters), weight 120 pounds (about 60 kilograms).” It is hard to imagine how Mughniyeh’s generous dimensions managed to shrink into a 120-pound model body … But the description only reconfirmed that Mughniyeh protected himself well and succeeded in misleading all his enemies.</p><p id="p1488" class="text-indent">After all the attacks, bombings, and hijackings he carried out, he <span class="ref-pnum">became</span> an admired hero of Hezbollah. He was lauded for his sophistication, his bravery, and his operational talents that made Hezbollah’s military arm feared by the world’s intelligence services. As his power increased, he became a major target for assassination by Israel and the West. <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh</span> realized this, and became a paranoid who lived a life of eternal flight, suspected everybody, including his closest confidants, changed his bodyguards very often, and slept every night in another place; his trips between Beirut, Damascus, and Tehran took place under a thick veil of secrecy.</p><p id="p1489" class="text-indent">According to the profile prepared by Israel and other secret services, Mughniyeh was a loner, very charismatic, very impulsive, and very <a id="pagebreak-rw_296"></a>knowledgeable about the newest electronic instruments and gadgets. He had an uncanny capacity for changing identities and appearances, which enabled him to fool his enemies; Israeli secret agents used to call him “the terrorist with nine lives.”</p><p id="p1490" class="text-indent">Aman officer David Barkai, a former major in the secret intelligence Unit 504 that assembled the profile file on Mughniyeh, said in an interview to the British <em class="calibre7">Sunday Times</em>: “We tried to knock him down several times in the late 1980s. We accumulated intelligence on him, but the closer we got, the less information we gleaned—no weak points, no women, money, drugs—nothing.”</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line101"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara137"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he hunt for Mughniyeh lasted for many years. In 1988, he was almost captured by the French authorities when his plane made a stopover in Paris. The CIA had supplied the French with information about <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh</span>, including his photograph and some details about the false passport he was using. But the French feared that his arrest might cause the murder of the French hostages that were held in Lebanon at that time, so they chose to ignore his presence and let him go away. The American services tried to capture him in Europe in 1986 and in Saudi Arabia in 1995. But he disappeared, as always.</p><p id="p1491" class="text-indent">In those years, Mughniyeh was deeply involved in planning and <span class="ref-pnum">executing</span> attacks on Israelis and Jews in Argentina. In 1992, he organized the bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires by a truck stuffed with explosives, driven by a suicide bomber. Twenty-nine people were killed. Some of the heads of Mossad saw in the operation an act of revenge for the killing of Hezbollah’s leader Sheikh Abbas Al-Musawi, in a helicopter <span class="ref-pnum">attack</span> in South Lebanon.</p><p id="p1492" class="text-indent">Two years later, another bombing shook Buenos Aires, this time at the Jewish community center, leaving eighty-six dead. Once again, some <span class="ref-pnum">experts</span> thought Hezbollah was avenging the abduction by Israel of one of its leaders, Mustafa Dirani, in Lebanon.</p><p id="p1493" class="text-indent">Intelligence crews from the United States and Israel, who flew to Buenos Aires to investigate the two bombings, concluded that they were connected. <a id="pagebreak-rw_297"></a>The modus operandi was identical—loading a truck with explosives and sending it to its target with a suicide bomber behind the wheel. Mughniyeh had used exactly the same method in Beirut and in Tyre at the outset of his career. The investigators established that the Iranian secret services and their local collaborators were involved in the bombings as well. At least one of the trucks, the one that had served for the embassy bombing, had been sold to the terrorists by a Buenos Aires Shiite car dealer, Carlos Alberto Taladin. The trail clearly led to Imad Mughniyeh.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line102"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara138"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n those years, Mughniyeh spent long stretches of time in Iran. After the assassination of Sheikh Al-Musawi, he feared that Israel would try to kill him, too. In Tehran, he created an operational team, composed of Hezbollah fighters and Iranian intelligence officers. His partners in setting up that unit were the Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Guards Mohsen Rezaee, and the Minister of Intelligence Ali Fallahian. Apparently, that unit carried out the two deadly attacks in Buenos Aires. These attacks had one result: Mughniyeh became Israel’s most wanted man. By his acts, he sentenced himself to death. But long years would pass by before his death sentence would be carried out.</p><p id="p1494" class="text-indent">In December 1994, Mughniyeh was seen in Beirut; shortly after, he escaped an assassination attempt by a booby-trapped car in a southern neighborhood. The Lebanese police quickly published its findings: an <span class="ref-pnum">explosive</span> charge had been placed underneath a car parked near the mosque where Sheikh Fadlallah read his sermon. The explosion destroyed the store of Fuad Mughniyeh, Imad’s brother, and his body was found in the rubble. But Imad, who was supposed to be there, changed his mind at the last <span class="ref-pnum">moment</span>, decided not to come, and survived. His nine lives saved him again.</p><p id="p1495" class="text-indent">A few weeks after the bombing, the security services, acting jointly with Hezbollah, arrested several civilians suspected of being involved in the <span class="ref-pnum">attack</span>, as Mossad collaborators. The main suspect was a man named Ahmed Halek.</p><p id="p1496" class="text-indent">According to the official police statement, “Halek and his wife had parked their car close to Fuad Mughniyeh’s store. Halek entered the store <a id="pagebreak-rw_298"></a>to make sure that Fuad was there, shook his hand, returned to the car, and activated the bomb.” The Lebanese newspaper <em class="calibre7">As-Safir</em>, quoting reliable sources, said that Halek had participated in a meeting with a senior Mossad official in Cyprus; the Mossad officer had instructed him how to use the bomb and paid him about $100,000. Halek was subsequently executed.</p><p id="p1497" class="text-indent">This time Mughniyeh escaped, but the Mossad agents did not give up. They painstakingly collected every small detail they could find, compiled reports from foreign intelligence services, and studied Mughniyeh’s <span class="ref-pnum">personal</span> methods. In 2002, Mossad received another report about <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh</span>, linking him to the shipping of fifty tons of weapons to Palestinian terrorists. But then he vanished again, although rumors had it that he had become the commander in chief of Hezbollah and the likely successor of Sheikh Nasrallah. His main connection was with Iranian intelligence, and he was said to act jointly with the Al-Quds (the Arab name for Jerusalem) Brigades, charged with the cooperation with Shiite communities <span class="ref-pnum">throughout</span> the world and with Iranian-controlled terrorist organizations. <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh’s</span> high position made it imperative for him to beef up his security measures. Persistent rumors affirmed that he once again had changed his outward appearance, possibly by another plastic surgery.</p><p id="p1498" class="text-indent">According to European sources, at the end of the Second Lebanon War, Mossad recruited quite a few Palestinians living in Lebanon, those strongly opposed to Hezbollah. One of them had a cousin in Mughniyeh’s village. She told the newly recruited agent that Mughniyeh had traveled to Europe and returned to Lebanon with a totally different face.</p><p id="p1499" class="text-indent">Mossad now had a new challenge—spying in plastic surgery clinics throughout Europe.</p><p id="p1500" class="text-indent">The unexpected breakthrough occured in Berlin. According to the <span class="ref-pnum">British</span> writer Gordon Thomas, the Mossad resident agent in Berlin, Reuven, met a German informer who maintained discreet connections with people in the former East Berlin. The informer reported that Imad Mughniyeh had recently gone through several plastic surgeries that completely changed his facial features. The treatment had taken place in a clinic that in the past had belonged to the Stasi, the former East German secret service. The Stasi <a id="pagebreak-rw_299"></a>had used the clinic for remodeling the faces of agents and terrorists sent on covert missions to the West.</p><p id="p1501" class="text-indent">After a tough negotiation, Reuven agreed to pay his German <span class="ref-pnum">collaborator</span> a substantial fee, and received from him a file containing thirty-four updated photos of Mughniyeh.</p><p id="p1502" class="text-indent">The analysis of the photos by Meir Dagan’s experts showed that <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh</span> had undergone jaw surgeries: the lower jaws had been cut, and bone taken from him had been grafted in them in order to achieve a more <span class="ref-pnum">narrow</span> chin line, which made him look skinny and emaciated. Several front teeth had been replaced by artificial teeth of a different shape. The eyes, too, had been treated by a tightening of the skin around them. The <span class="ref-pnum">treatment</span> was completed by dying his hair gray and replacing his eyeglasses with contact lenses. Mughniyeh bore no resemblance to the “original” <span class="ref-pnum">anymore</span>, and the old pictures collected by Western services since the eighties had become irrelevant.</p><p id="p1503" class="text-indent">According to foreign sources, Mossad now started to plan Mughniyeh’s killing. Meir Dagan summoned his best people, including the head of <span class="ref-pnum">Caesarea</span>, the commander of the Kidon team, and several other senior officers dealing with the Mughniyeh file. It soon became clear that there was no way to hit Mughniyeh in a non-Muslim country. He very rarely traveled to the West, and felt safe only in Iran and Syria. The Israelis knew any action on their territory would mean great risks. True, Israel had operated in Arab countries in the past and carried out coups in Beirut during its Operation Wrath of God; its commandos had even gone as far as Tunis, where they allegedly killed the terrorist leader Abu Jihad. But Tehran and Damascus were more suspicious, more heavily armed and dangerous than Beirut or Tunis. On the other hand, Meir Dagan knew the tremendous impact a <span class="ref-pnum">successful</span> operation would have. The killing of the most lethal terrorist leader in Damascus would prove that nobody can escape the long arm of Mossad. The refuge and fortress of Israel’s enemies would spread confusion, fear, and insecurity among the rest of the terrorist leaders.</p><p id="p1504" class="text-indent">According to the London <em class="calibre7">Independent</em> daily, the plan that emerged from the discussions at Mossad headquarters was based on the probability of <a id="pagebreak-rw_300"></a>Mughniyeh coming to Damascus on February 12, 2008. On that day, he was supposed to meet Iranian and Syrian officials who were to participate in the celebration of the anniversary of the Iranian revolution.</p><p id="p1505" class="text-indent">After the possibilities had been studied, it was decided that the <span class="ref-pnum">operation</span> would be carried out by placing a rigged vehicle directly beside <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh’s</span> car.</p><p id="p1506" class="text-indent">Mossad now plunged into frantic activity to get detailed intelligence from all its sources, including foreign services: would Mughniyeh indeed come to Damascus? And if he did—what identity would he choose? In what car would he come? Where would he stay? Who would accompany him? At what time would he arrive at the planned meeting with the Syrian and Iranian representatives? Would the Syrian authorities be informed of his arrival? Would the Hezbollah leaders know about his planned trip?</p><p id="p1507" class="text-indent">The report that tipped the scales in favor of the assassination project came from a very reliable source. It confirmed Mughniyeh’s intention to travel to Damascus. That information was corroborated, according to the Lebanese <em class="calibre7">El-Balad</em> newspaper, by agents who planted tracking devices in the cars of Mughniyeh and the Hezbollah leaders.</p><p id="p1508" class="text-indent">The well-oiled machine of Caesarea came in at this point. By <span class="ref-pnum">labyrinthine</span> routes, the various Kidon teams arrived in Damascus. A special team smuggled the explosives into the Syrian capital.</p><p id="p1509" class="text-indent">At the last moment, new, crucial information was reported by a veteran Mossad informer. Whenever he came to Damascus, the report stated, <span class="ref-pnum">Mughniyeh</span> would meet his mistress. For the first time, Mossad spymasters learned that Mughniyeh was having a secret affair. The pretty woman <span class="ref-pnum">expected</span> Mughniyeh in a discreet apartment in the city. She knew the dates of Mughniyeh’s arrival in Damascus in advance, from Beirut or from <span class="ref-pnum">Tehran</span>. He used to visit their love nest by himself, dismissing his bodyguards and his driver beforehand.</p><p id="p1510" class="text-indent">Urgent messages alerted the watchers who were already in place. Will Mughniyeh visit his lover this time as well? Does the owner of the <span class="ref-pnum">apartment</span> know that he is coming?</p><p id="p1511" class="text-indent">On the eve of the operation, the members of the hit team arrived in <a id="pagebreak-rw_301"></a>Damascus. They flew to the Syrian capital from various European cities. According to the <em class="calibre7">Independent</em>, the team numbered three agents: one came from Paris on an Air France flight; the second took off from Milan with <span class="ref-pnum">Alitalia</span>, and the third used a short flight from Amman with Royal Jordanian. The three agents’ false papers indicated that they were businessmen, two of them in the car trade and the third a travel agent. They declared on arrival that they had come to spend a short vacation in Syria, and passed through immigration without any problems. They drove to the city separately and got together only after making sure that they were not followed. They later met with some auxiliaries, who had arrived from Beirut, and were taken to a concealed garage, where a rented car was waiting and, beside it, a load of explosives that included plastic charges and tiny metal balls.</p><p id="p1512" class="text-indent">The three hit men locked themselves in the garage, prepared the <span class="ref-pnum">explosive</span> charge, and placed it in the rented car. The charge was not placed—as certain newspapers would later claim—in the headrest of Mughniyeh’s car, but in the radio compartment of the rented vehicle.</p><p id="p1513" class="text-indent">Another team of Mossad watchers waited for Mughniyeh’s arrival from Beirut. Their role was to stick to him, hang close to the apartment building where he would meet his mistress, and report about his departure. They had to follow him and make sure he arrived at the meeting in Kfar Sousa. Among the people he was to meet there were the new Iranian ambassador to Damascus and the most secretive man in Syria, General Muhammad Suleiman. Suleiman was, among others, in charge of transferring arms from Iran and Syria to Hezbollah, and he maintained close relations with Imad Mughniyeh. (Suleiman, who had been involved in the secret Syrian nuclear project, had only six months to live; he would be mysteriously <span class="ref-pnum">assassinated</span> on August 2, during a dinner with friends at his beach house. See chapter 18.)</p><p id="p1514" class="text-indent">That same evening, the Iranian embassy had scheduled a celebration of the anniversary of the revolution at the Iranian cultural center at Kfar Sousa, quite close to the safe house where Mughniyeh was to meet the Iranian and Syrian officials. He decided, though, not to participate in the festivities, only to confer with his partners and leave Damascus.</p><p id="p1515" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_302"></a>On February 12, in the morning, the Mossad teams were in place. The watchers took position around the apartment building, Mughniyeh’s first destination. In the late afternoon, they reported that Mughniyeh had <span class="ref-pnum">arrived</span> in his lover’s apartment—and in the evening they informed their superiors that he had set out on his way to his second destination. They hoped it would be his last.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line103"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara139"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Pajero crossed Damascus and arrived in Kfar Sousa. The watchers followed Mughniyeh, continuously reporting his moves. The rigged car had been brought to the area where Mughniyeh would park. The activation signal was going to be given from a great distance by electronic means. The agents who had rigged the car had left the place long ago and were on their way to the airport.</p><p id="p1516" class="text-indent">The electronic sensors followed the silver SUV. It stopped. An auxiliary parked the rigged car close to the silver Pajero.</p><p id="p1517" class="text-indent">Shortly before ten <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>., a thunderous explosion shook the Kfar Sousa neighborhood, not far from an Iranian school (empty at this hour) and by a public park. Exactly at the moment when Mughniyeh got out of his SUV, the car beside him exploded.</p><p id="p1518" class="text-indent">Mughniyeh was dead.</p><p id="p1519" class="text-indent">His death shook Hezbollah to the core; it was a terrible blow to the Syrian government, only a few months after its secret nuclear reactor had been pulverized.</p><p id="p1520" class="text-indent">Six months after Mughniyeh’s death, in November 2008, the Lebanese authorities announced the discovery of a spy ring working for Mossad. One of the people arrested, fifty-year-old Ali Jarrah from the Bekaa <span class="ref-pnum">Valley</span>, had worked for Mossad for the last twenty years for a monthly salary of $7,000. He was accused of traveling to Syria frequently, on missions for Mossad. In February 2008, a few days before the operation, he had <span class="ref-pnum">traveled</span> to Kfar Sousa. The Lebanese services that arrested Jarrah discovered a cache of sophisticated photography equipment, a video camera, and a GPS, expertly concealed in his car. Jarrah broke under interrogation and <span class="ref-pnum">confessed</span> that his Mossad handlers had instructed him to watch, photograph, <a id="pagebreak-rw_303"></a>and collect information about the neighborhoods Mughniyeh was about to visit, including the love nest.</p><p id="p1521" class="text-indent">Israel denied any connection to the assassination, but the Hezbollah spokesmen repeatedly accused “the Israeli Zionists” of the murder of “the Jihad hero, who died as a <em class="calibre7">shahid</em> (martyr).”</p><p id="p1522" class="text-indent">The U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack did not share that view. He described Mughniyeh as “a cold-blooded killer, a mass <span class="ref-pnum">murderer</span>, and a terrorist responsible for ending countless lives.”</p><p id="p1523" class="text-indent">“The world,” McCormack concluded, “is a better place without him.”</p></div>
