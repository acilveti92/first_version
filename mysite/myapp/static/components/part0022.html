<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter017">SEVENTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">A tense stillness settled over the room. From somewhere downstairs there came the sound of a door closing. The candles on the altar had burned low now, tall plumes of black smoke rising from the stubs, the flames elongating and flickering, making Humphrey’s shadow loom enormously on the wall behind him. He made no move to replace the candles; indeed, he seemed ill at ease with his new responsibility, lowering himself heavily to sit on the floor beneath the window, his back against the wall. Here he waited uncomfortably, watching me with a brow furrowed in mixed concern and apology. The only sound was my quick, shallow breaths through my nose, as I struggled to keep my breathing even and not to panic at the mass of cloth jamming my mouth. I saw that Humphrey carried a knife at his belt; his fingers strayed to it every few moments, though I was sure that, for all his great size, the young man had a gentle nature and had only reluctantly assumed his role as Jenkes’ strong arm. I wondered if he would have the nerve to use the knife on me if I made an attempt to escape and decided he probably would; his fear of Jenkes would overcome his natural compassion.</p>
<p class="indented">A sharp wind rattled at the shutters; Humphrey started, whipped his head around, then laughed sheepishly at his own nerves. I implored him with my eyes, in case I might appeal to his better nature before Jenkes returned, though I had little hope he would take pity; Humphrey had better reason than anyone to know what Jenkes did to those who endangered the cause.</p>
<p class="indented">My shoulders had begun to ache from the unnatural position of my arms; I tried moving my wrists but the cords were bound too tightly to try wriggling free and cut badly into my flesh if I did so. I thought again of the faces I had recognised at the Mass. There was Richard Godwyn, who distributed Jenkes’s clandestine books, and Rector Underhill’s sharp-eyed old servant, Adam, both associated with the Catherine Wheel and with Lincoln College; either of them might have reasons for silencing the Fellows who had died, if only to protect themselves. Adam in particular, as I had thought earlier, would have no lack of opportunity to spirit away keys from the rector’s lodgings – but if they faithfully attended Mass here, I could see no reason why they would want to draw attention to the Catherine Wheel group. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall. I had to concentrate on finding a way to escape; all this speculation would be worthless if I was to have my throat cut in an alley before sunrise. The thought brought a fresh convulsion of fear as the reality of my present situation began fully to sink in; I had feared for my life before now, but never had I felt so helpless to fight for it.</p>
<p class="indented">I stretched my neck to try and ease the ache in my jaw, making the cut at the base of my throat gape and sting viciously; the pain made me catch my breath suddenly, sucking in a piece of the cloth which lodged in my throat. Half choking, I flung my head from side to side to try and dislodge it, emitting tiny strangled noises as I felt my eyes bulging alarmingly. It was only when I fell sideways with a thud and began writhing on the floor that Humphrey, realising what was happening, leapt to my side and began to claw the gag from my mouth. When finally he had extracted it altogether, I fell back limply against his shoulder, gasping for air, my eyes streaming.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’ll leave it for now, Doctor Bruno, but you’d best not cry for help or I will be obliged to beat you,’ Humphrey whispered apologetically, propping me up against the wall as if I were a doll and watching me with concern.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does he really mean to kill me?’ I asked in a croak, when eventually I could speak.</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey looked at me doubtfully, his big good-natured face pained, as if caught between duty and compassion.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He says you will bring down the Earl of Leicester and all the queen’s soldiers on our heads,’ he whispered, his eyes growing wide, ‘and we shall be taken to the Tower and racked, even the women. Even Widow Kenney, and I won’t let you do that,’ he added, suddenly determined.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are fond of Widow Kenney, then?’ I asked softly.</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey nodded emphatically.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She took me in when I first came to Oxford,’ he said earnestly, in his lilting voice. ‘Six years ago. I didn’t have a penny. Now I have a home and a good job, and it is as if I have a family.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am sure you are of great value to her. Were your own family Catholics?’ I asked, between painful coughs.</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head, again with the same exaggerated movement a child might make, his lips pressed firmly together.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Widow Kenney and Master Jenkes taught me all I know of the true faith. That is why I know we must fight to keep it safe from the heretics.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You said “the women”,’ I prompted, after a while. ‘Are there many women who come to these meetings?’</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey looked at me hesitantly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come now – I will be dead in a few hours, Humphrey, what harm can it do to pass the time by talking to me a little? You will be doing me a kindness.’</p>
<p class="indented">This seemed to sway him, because he shuffled closer on his backside and adopted a conspiratorial tone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There are some women from the town. Not gentlewomen, though – they hear Mass at one of the manor houses in the countryside along with their own sort, mainly. Except for one.’ A kind of softness spread over his face and I sensed I was near my target.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sophia?’</p>
<p class="indented">He blinked in surprise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you know Sophia?’ When I nodded, he beamed. ‘She does not come so often now, but I always know it’s her, even under her hood. She walks like a sort of – like a tree in a breeze, do you know what I mean? Like the willows by the river.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do. And tell me – does Sophia have friends among the group here? I mean, friends she might go to if she were in trouble?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, should she be in trouble, sir?’ he asked innocently, and I found it almost touching that he still called me ‘sir’ even though I was bound hand and foot and he was keeping guard over me with a knife. When I did not reply, he only frowned and shook his head. ‘I do not know her friends. The only one she was close to was Father Jerome, but then everyone loves Father Jerome. It was he who brought her here first.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is Father Jerome?’ I asked, sitting up, my interest piqued. ‘I thought Father William Bernard was your priest here?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh no,’ Humphrey said, proud of his superior knowledge. ‘Father William hardly ever says Mass since Father Jerome came, only if Father Jerome has to be out of town. He goes quite often to Hazeley Court, you know, out in Great Hazeley on the London road, where the grand Catholic families come to hear Mass. I expect he has gone there tonight.’</p>
<p class="indented">My mind was working furiously, but I tried to keep my face and voice even so as not to betray my thoughts.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And this Father Jerome – is he an Oxford man?’</p>
<p class="indented">Again, the exaggerated head-shake.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He came from the college in France.’ He looked stricken. ‘Though that is a great secret and I should not have told you. I beg you, do not tell Master Jenkes I said it, will you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course not. And what is he like, Father Jerome?’</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey’s face took on a dreamy cast.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Like – like I imagine Our Lord Jesus would be if you met him. He makes you feel – I can’t explain it – like he thinks you’re the most special person he ever met, do you know what I mean? Though I don’t understand a lot of the Mass – I have never had book learning, you see – I love to listen when he says it. I like it better than when Father William comes,’ he added, his face creasing into a pout. ‘When Father Jerome speaks, it sounds like music.’ He sighed happily, one hand toying with the knife at his belt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is he a young man?’ I said, leaning forward and moving on to my knees to ease the stiffness in my legs. The movement startled Humphrey out of his reverie; he jerked upright, but when he was certain that I was not attempting anything, he relaxed back against the wall.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Father Jerome has the face of an angel,’ he said reverently. ‘I’ve seen a picture of one,’ he added, presumably lest I think the comparison unfounded.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The face of an angel,’ I repeated slowly, trying to keep as still as possible. I had discovered that the cords binding my ankles were not as tight as those around my wrists; sitting on my heels, I was able to work one finger slowly inside the knot that held them. If I could keep Humphrey talking, he might not notice my surreptitious movements. ‘Tell me about Hazeley Court, then,’ I said lightly. ‘It sounds a grand place.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I have never seen it, but I believe it is very fine. The owner, Sir Francis Tolling, is now in Bridewell Gaol in London for attending private Mass, and his wife uses the house to shelter those who need it. That’s all I know.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Missionary priests, you mean?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Any who labour in the English vineyard and need somewhere safe, out of sight.’ He shifted his weight nervously. ‘There is one among our number, Master Nicholas Owen, who is a master carpenter – he was here tonight, in fact, though you would not have known him under his hood. But he is employed in all the great houses of the faithful, they say, to build secret rooms.’ He leaned in, looking carefully from side to side before lowering his voice further. ‘In the attics, the chimneys, the sewers, the staircases, even inside the walls, so God’s workers can hide from the searchers. Is it not cunning?’ He rubbed his hands together and beamed with delight. ‘Though I should not have said that either – you won’t tell Jenkes, will you? Are you all right, sir?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What? Oh – yes, it is nothing. My shoulder pains me a bit, that is all.’ I realised that I had been screwing my face up and clenching my jaw in concentration as I tried to poke one end of the knot through with only one finger. It was so close to coming free, it would not do for Humphrey to suspect me now. He nodded in sympathy, and glanced furtively at the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wonder if I might loosen your bonds a bit, sir,’ he said, his eyes flitting again to the door as if Jenkes might burst through at any moment. ‘Not altogether, I mean, just so you’re not in pain. After all, it’s not as if you’d get very far is it, you being so little, and me with the knife and all?’ He laughed, though I detected a note of anxiety, and I joined in heartily at the absurd idea of my overpowering him. In truth, I had no idea of how I might proceed, even if I did manage to free my legs; without the use of my arms I could do nothing, and even with them I did not much rate my chances in a fight against Humphrey, with or without a knife. While he deliberated about whether to loosen my ropes and I continued my own attempt as best I could behind my back, there came the unmistakeable creak of a tread in the corridor outside and we both froze. My throat contracted; I had not expected Jenkes to return so soon, and my escape plan faded before it was even fully formed. I took a deep breath, as well as I was able with my heart thudding in the back of my mouth. So this was it, I thought. Back in Italy, at San Domenico Maggiore, I had invited a death sentence for the sake of a book; now, after running from it all these years, I faced death again, all because I was too foolishly greedy for a book. Well, I thought, I would try whatever means I could to fight, and if I must die, at least I would not die like a coward under Rowland Jenkes’s mocking glare.</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey gathered his wits as the footsteps drew closer, snatching up Jenkes’s linen scarf and shoving it back into my mouth, though more loosely than it had been before, just as I felt the end of the rope pop through and the knot at my ankles subtly slacken under my scrabbling fingers. The footsteps halted outside the door and there was a tentative knock, followed by a woman’s voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Humphrey? Is that you?’</p>
<p class="indented">Humphrey deflated visibly with relief, and scrambled to his feet to open the door. Widow Kenney stood outside in her nightgown, holding a candle, a woollen shawl around her shoulders. She looked first at Humphrey, then at me in my sorry state, bundled into a corner on the floor, and exhaled with exasperation.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That Jenkes,’ she said, still looking at me with a reproving moue, as if Jenkes were a naughty cat and I a dead mouse he had dropped on her clean floor. ‘What is he making you do now, Humphrey?’</p>
<p class="indented">The boy hung his head and Widow Kenney beckoned him towards the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let me speak with you a moment.’ She studied me briefly as if assessing the danger of leaving me unattended, then appeared to decide I was harmless. ‘I have told him, I will not have blood shed in my inn,’ she hissed at Humphrey as she ushered him into the corridor, ‘and you should know better, Humphrey Pritchard.’ I did not catch his protest but the murmur of their urgent exchange was audible beyond the closed door.</p>
<p class="indented">I had to act quickly. Without the need to conceal my movements from Humphrey, I tugged at the loosened end of the knot binding my ankles and it came loose in my hand. Shaking my legs free of the cord as fast as I could, I struggled painfully to my feet and hobbled across the room to the small makeshift altar, where the candles had almost burned down to the sticks. With my back to the altar, I tried to position the knot fastening the bindings around my wrists over the flame, hoping it would burn through, but the cord was sturdier than it looked and the flame feeble; though I could smell it beginning to singe, I doubted whether the knot would break before Humphrey came back and caught me. Outside in the passageway, the voices grew louder in heated argument. Because I could not see what I was doing, I kept scorching my hands on the flame and was grateful this time for the cloth in my mouth that muffled my cries as I did so. My greatest fear was that I would knock the candle and set my clothes alight; to escape a burning at the hands of the Inquisition only to bring one on myself by accident would be beyond irony, I thought, as I twisted the cord first one way and then another over the flame, trying to arch my arms as far as I could from my body. The cord crackled suddenly and I felt a rush of fierce heat on my right hand; the knot had caught fire, and I screamed into the cloth as the flame seared my hand and sleeve, but the knot had loosened enough for me to pull my hands out. The flaming coils of cord fell to the floor and I stamped on them furiously, clutching my burned hand to my chest and catching a whiff of scorched flesh as I did so. The voices outside the door silenced abruptly and I knew I would only have one chance at getting past them. Ignoring the pain of my stretched and blistered skin, I grabbed the heavy silver candlestick from the altar, blew out the guttering flame and held it aloft just as Humphrey flung the door open and paused for just an instant, his mouth gaping at the sight.</p>
<p class="indented">His hesitation was just long enough; before he could raise his arms, I swung the solid base of the candlestick at his temple. My aim was good; there was a sickening crunch and he fell backwards, blood spurting from the gash, matting his fair hair. His large body crumpled to the floor; he appeared to be knocked out cold. The widow held up her hands in fright and shook her head violently, her mouth working in terrified silent protest; holding the candlestick aloft again so that she cowered into a corner, I wrested the knife from Humphrey’s belt, threw the candlestick back at her feet with a last warning look and darted through the door into the corridor. All down the crooked stairs and across the inn yard I fully expected to see Jenkes at any moment and kept the knife levelled in front of me lest he appear, while glancing back over my shoulder to see if Humphrey might have revived to pursue me, but it seemed fortune was on my side at last; I emerged from the gates of the inn yard into the street without seeing a soul.</p>
<p class="indented">The sky was still dark, etched with streaks of moonlight between the clouds, and I rested for a moment against the wall of a house to catch my breath, realising that in all the frenzy I had not stopped to remove the scarf gagging me. Now I extracted it and, holding one end in my teeth, wrapped it gingerly around my burned hand. The pain made me briefly dizzy, so that I feared my legs might buckle beneath me, and once the temporary exhilaration of my escape had subsided, I realised with a falling sensation that my purse had been stolen and I had no means of getting past the watchmen at the North Gate. Even worse, I thought, what if they knew Jenkes well and had been tipped by him to watch out for me? In this city, it was impossible to know who was a friend.</p>
<p class="indented">The square tower of St Michael’s Church at the North Gate rose above the battlements of the city wall, its silhouette a landmark as I crept along under the eaves of houses until I was forced to break my cover and run across the broad street that lay parallel to the city wall. I looked wildly from side to side as I dashed over, anticipating the sight of Jenkes at any moment, but the street was empty. At the gate I paused, but could think of no other means of gaining the city again; the wall was far too high and sheer to be scaled and all the other gates would be guarded too at this hour. My only choice was to wait until first light, when the gates would be opened to traders, by which time Jenkes or Humphrey would likely have caught up with me, or to try and persuade the watchmen I had already paid to let me back. I banged with the flat of my good hand on the small door set into the high oak gates but there was no reply. I hammered harder and called out, and at last a bleary face appeared behind the square iron grille. Eventually I heard the scrape of a bolt and the door opened.</p>
<p class="indented">I murmured my gratitude, glancing around again for signs of movement in the dark streets, and as soon as I was out of the watchman’s sight, I picked up my pace and ran the short way up St Mildred’s Lane, holding tight to the handle of Humphrey’s knife. Never had I been so glad to see the tower of Lincoln College looming above me. Gently I tapped on the narrow window of Cobbett’s room. After a pause, I tapped again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett!’ I hissed, as loudly as I dared. ‘It is I, Bruno – open the gate!’</p>
<p class="indented">I was greeted only by silence. Hoisting myself up to the sill, I peered in and saw the old porter lolling in his chair, his chin slumped on his chest and his mouth gaping, a skein of spittle hanging from his lower lip.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Cobbett!’ I called again, tapping the window harder, but he did not stir. Cursing under my breath, I stepped back and looked up at the college walls; all the windows were dark and I wondered whether I dared risk waking anyone else by calling louder. I did not want to be left in the street outside the college; that would be one of the first places Jenkes would choose to look for me. Then, as the clouds shifted and a thin ray of pearly moonlight broke through, I remembered another possibility and hoped my guess was right. The very furthest window on the west range belonged to Norris’s room; though it appeared closed, I managed to jam the fingers of my good hand inside the frame and found that it had indeed been left unlatched. As far as I could see into the darkness, the lane appeared to be empty in both directions. As I heaved myself up and levered myself sideways through the narrow opening, flinching as I scraped my burned hand against the frame, I prayed that neither of the room’s occupants had returned during the evening.</p>
<p class="indented">I tumbled through the window, landing awkwardly on the large wooden chest beneath. I froze for a moment, listening for the sound of breathing or movement from the bedchamber beyond, but the stillness was that of an empty room. A faint light from the window facing into the quadrangle outlined the shapes of furniture; the floor seemed to be littered with debris and after some tripping and fumbling across the surfaces of dressers and tables, I managed to locate a tinderbox that had been left on an ornamental table under the window. Striking it, I lit a stub of candle on the desk and looked around to see the room in a state of chaos, just as Roger Mercer’s room had been on the morning he was killed. Clothes had been flung from the wardrobe, books and papers scattered and all the drawers of Norris’s fine writing desk pulled open and emptied.</p>
<p class="indented">I slumped down on the settle by the long-cold fireplace, its cushions all thrown about the hearth, and tried to make myself breathe calmly for the first time in what felt like hours as I gathered my frayed thoughts. My shoulders ached insistently, my burned hand was throbbing and the cut at my throat stung, though it was not deep, but now that I was out of immediate danger I found I was able to think more sharply and clearly. Not that the danger had passed, of course; Jenkes had already decided that I knew too much to be left alone and once he discovered my escape he would almost certainly try to track me down before I could speak to anyone. From my conversation with Humphrey, a theory had begun to take shape in the back of my mind about the murders, though as yet it was still hazy, like figures seen through fog. If my guesswork was correct, then I thought I knew where I might find the answers. And if Jenkes was to be believed, I had to get there before dawn, before Thomas Allen was silenced for good.</p>
<p class="indented">First, though, I needed to get word to Sidney, so that he would know where I had gone and the suspicions that had led me there; I hoped then he would be able to follow if I did not return – even though by then it might be too late.</p>
<p class="indented">Without wasting any more time, I began to comb through the mess of paper and books on Norris’s writing desk for a quill to set down my thoughts for Sidney as briefly as I could before setting off in pursuit, but I could find no ink. Inside the first open drawer, I discovered a stick of vermilion sealing wax and several sheets of fine-quality writing paper. The candle I had lit was burning low; as I glanced quickly around the room to see if there was another to hand, my eye fell on the chest beneath the window. The solid padlock that had secured it was hanging open; it had clearly been forced. Grabbing the dying candle, I prised open the heavy lid, but the trunk appeared to contain only linen undershirts. Undeterred, I rummaged through swathes of cloth until my fingers scraped the wooden base of the trunk and probed into all four corners, yielding nothing. I cursed silently; it seemed anything of value here had already been taken. I brought the candle close and flung out all the contents, scattering them about the floor until I could bring the candle into the depths of the chest and confirm that it was truly empty.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Merda</em>!’ I was about to close the lid when I noticed a small corner of the wood cut away in the floor of the chest, barely wide enough to slip in a fingernail. Setting down the candle, I pulled Humphrey’s kitchen knife from my belt, leaned into the trunk and was just able to insert the tip of the blade into the gap and work it upwards, my heart pounding. There was a soft click, and I felt the wood loosen. I pushed down and the false bottom lifted up easily; reaching into the compartment beneath, my fingers brushed a sheaf of papers before closing on something sharp that pricked my skin, making me draw my hand back quickly in case it was a trap. Reaching in again, more gingerly this time, I pulled out the offending object into the dim light and gave a low whistle when I realised what I held.</p>
<p class="indented">It was a short-handled whip with perhaps forty or fifty cords tied to the end, each cord the length of about half a yard and studded with hard knots. Through each of these many knots was threaded a short piece of crooked wire bent into a hook, and many of these hooks bore traces of dried blood and torn flesh. I shuddered at the cruelty of the instrument, while at the same time it was as if the scales had fallen from my eyes and the suspicions that had formerly floated as if in thick fog suddenly emerged in almost total clarity.</p>
<p class="indented">I reached again into the secret compartment and pulled out the sheaf of papers I had felt earlier. It proved to be a package of dog-eared letters, dirty and tied with fraying ribbon. The topmost paper bore the unmistakeable imprint of a bloody thumb. One glance at the faded ink of the uppermost letter confirmed that these were written in a combination of symbols and numbers, but I did not need to decipher them to know that these were the letters for which Roger Mercer and James Coverdale’s room had been searched. Tied together with the bundle of letters was another document, this one on older vellum and sealed with wax. The seal was still intact and in the fading light its mark was indistinct, but I hesitated only a moment before breaking the seal and unfolding the document, holding it next to the candle stub. The flame was so faint now that it barely illuminated the elaborate curling script, but the first line was enough to make my breath seize for a moment in my throat.</p>
<p class="indented"><em class="calibre2">Pius, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, in lasting memory of the matter: Regnans in excelsis</em>, it began, and I almost dropped it, my hands had begun to shake so hard. I knew immediately what I held. This was perhaps the most damning paper an Englishman could possess: a copy of the Papal Bull issued by Pope Pius V some thirteen years ago, declaring Queen Elizabeth of England a heretic and containing her sentence of excommunication from the Catholic Church. It ended by forbidding the queen’s subjects from recognising or obeying her as monarch; in those words, Pius had all but called for her to be overthrown. This was the Bull that some of the more extreme Catholics in the European seminaries regarded as a licence to assassinate the queen in God’s name. Even to bring a copy into this country was high treason and would earn the one who carried it a traitor’s death. I exhaled slowly, then froze as I thought I heard a scuffling sound outside the window. Had I walked directly into another trap? Whoever had ransacked this room had undoubtedly been looking for these papers, just as he had been searching for them in Mercer’s room, yet he had not found the chest’s secret compartment. Perhaps he was still watching the room and had seen my candle. I held my breath and caught another distinct movement outside; then a high, unearthly scream rent the air, followed by another, a sound like nothing so much the shriek of an infant in pain, and I sank back to the floor, trembling and laughing at my own skittishness; it was only a pair of foxes fighting in the lane.</p>
<p class="indented">But the disturbance had brought me to my senses and reminded me that there was no time to waste. I tied the package of letters in one of the linen shirts from the chest, where I also found a travelling cloak that I hastily fastened around my shoulders, my own having been left at the Catherine Wheel. After some scrabbling I located an inkwell under the detritus on Norris’s desk and wrote a hasty note to Sidney explaining where the items had been found and where I was going. This done, I reached inside my shirt and pulled out the sheet of paper with the copy of the code from Mercer’s almanac; this I folded inside the note to Sidney and sealed it as best I could with the sealing wax I had found in the drawer, though I had no ring to imprint on it. Then I grabbed the package, blew out the guttering candle, lifted the latch of the door to the stairwell and found it locked fast. Whoever had turned over the room in Norris and Allen’s absence must have let himself in with his own key, unless he too had climbed in the window. Cursing again, I wrestled open the window above the desk that gave on to the courtyard, struggled on to the sill, encumbered now by my bandaged hand and the package I was trying to hold secure under the other arm, and eased myself through, unfortunately catching the cloak on the window latch at the last minute and falling through sideways with a thud and a muffled cry.</p>
<p class="indented">I lay quietly for a moment in the hope that my movements had gone unheard, looking up at the marbled sky above the roofs, already turning from velvet black to a dark indigo behind the streaks of cloud. If the sky was growing lighter, I needed to get this business done and hurry out of the city before dawn. It was too dark to make out the hands of the clock; the quadrangle remained blanketed in the stillness of the dead hours. Nothing stirred; somewhere distant the fox cried again and I was about to pick myself up when I saw the lantern. It approached me at a quick pace from the buildings opposite, held up by a hooded figure who stopped, looming over me, and lowered the light to the level of my face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, well, Doctor Bruno. Helping yourself again? This is becoming quite a habit. What will your explanation be this time, I wonder? I can hardly wait to find out.’</p>
<p class="indented">I could not see Walter Slythurst’s face, but his malevolent smirk was apparent in every icy word.</p>
