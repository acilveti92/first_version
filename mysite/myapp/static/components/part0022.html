				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack panned his field glasses along the line of enemy defences. The ancient Dutch fort at Reshire shimmered in the heat haze, then came sharply into focus. The power of its defences made the breath catch in his throat. Stalker’s division was lining up, readying for the assault. Jack and Ballard had found a vantage point on a small rise well out of the line of march. It gave them a fine view of both the fort and the army, allowing them to study the two forces as they prepared for the fight that both sides knew had been coming.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Persian commander had had two days since the British division landed at Hallila Bay. Two days that he had used to gather his men and make sure the defences were as strong as he could make them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They started with a network of trenches facing the direction the British army had to take if it were to storm the fort. They had been dug deep, the tops reinforced with sandbags, their path twisting and turning across the end of the peninsula. The long, wearing campaign in the Crimea had taught the world the most modern techniques of siege warfare. The Persian defenders had clearly employed the lessons the allied army had learnt, and now the redcoats would have to attack a series of well-constructed and scientifically designed trench systems packed with enemy soldiers. Hundreds of muskets were now aimed at the British troops who had formed up in front of them with ponderous precision. The power of their massed volleys would be brutal, the redcoats forced to advance into a storm of musket fire that would gut their ordered ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Behind the trenches the ruins of old houses formed the next obstacle the attackers would face if they succeeded in breaching the first. The Persian soldiers had worked tirelessly to clear their fields of fire, and the redcoats would have to brave a storm of shot in the more open ground. There they would be forced to assault ruined wall after ruined wall, each one certain to be defended to the death by the fierce warriors who held them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Dutch fort formed the furthest part of the defences. It stood at the end of a rocky peninsula that jutted far out into the sea. The forbidding grey waters crashed around the heavy band of rocks at its base, the sound of the impact echoing across the peninsula like distant thunder. The old fort had been repaired and strengthened by the Persian defenders, who had seized upon its ancient defences to form the bedrock of their position. Broad ramparts lined the thick mud walls buttressed by bastions dotted at regular distances along their length. The whole was surrounded by a deep dry moat, a killing ground where any attackers would be exposed to constant fire from the defenders safe behind the ramparts.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Close to two thousand Persian soldiers were crammed into the network of defences. They came from the Dashti and Tungestoon tribes, the hardest of the irregular infantry in the Persian army. They were sarbaz infantry, the troops that made up the bulk of the Shah’s armed forces, and they were determined to stand firm and repel the invading red horde that had dared to venture into their homeland.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Persian battalions were dressed for battle. Each fuadji wore a different-coloured cloth jacket, which created a gaudy kaleidoscope across the wide defensive line. The bright jackets were tucked into wide white pantaloons that were fastened above ankle-high boots with long stockings. On their heads they wore tall cone-shaped ram’s-fleece hats called popakhs, which made them look distinctly foreign to the watching British soldiers. The rest of their uniforms were similar to those worn by the marching redcoats, the thick white cross belt worn over the chest a legacy of the decades now long past when British officers schooled the Persian troops in the art of war.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sarbaz infantrymen were armed with long smooth-bore muskets. They were outdated when compared to the modern Enfield rifles carried by the British redcoats, but were still reliable and brutally effective. The Persian weapons used English-supplied flintlocks, another legacy of the British association with their army. The redcoats would come under fire from weapons sparked by the product of English manufacturing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The enemy infantry waited for an assault they knew was inevitable. They trusted to their guns and their defences, confident that the red-coated army they faced would break itself on their walls and trenches. They would defeat the invaders and send them scurrying back to the boats that hovered on the horizon. Confident of victory, the sarbaz waited for the assault without fear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But they hadn’t reckoned on the Indian navy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The gunboats, sloops and steam frigates had manoeuvred into position around one thousand seven hundred yards away from the fort, and now they opened the bombardment that signalled the start of the assault. Heavy artillery shells ripped through the air, their passage marked by a dreadful keening. They smashed into the network of trenches, great gouts of earth thrown high into the sky as explosions rippled across the defenders’ line.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Bang on time.’ Ballard snapped shut his pocket watch and returned it to his pocket. ‘Do pardon the pun. You have to hand it to our jolly Jack Tars. They certainly know how to shoot.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack winced as a second salvo of shells roared out from the ships anchored close to the shore. He knew what it was to be on the receiving end of well-directed artillery fire. The terror of marching into a bombardment from a battery of heavy cannon still haunted his dreams, and he felt a pang of sympathy for the Persian soldiers. The second round of shells ripped into the trenches. Many exploded too early, the flash of the explosions bright even in the early-morning sunshine. But the navy gunners knew their trade, and a great number exploded the moment they entered the trenches. Even from a distance Jack could hear the screams as the shells tore men apart, their dreadful effect magnified in the closed confines of the trenches. The slaughter would have been terrible to behold.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A third, then a fourth salvo crashed out. Jack could picture the sweat on the smoke-streaked faces of the ships’ gunners as they readied their enormous weapons. They would be going through the well-rehearsed drills without thought, the commands of the gun captains redundant after countless hours of repetition. The sailors were fortunate. They were far enough away to see their target as an abstract thing, not a living mass of humanity. They were spared bearing witness to the dreadful destruction they were bringing down on the Persian soldiers closest to the British assault troops.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned and looked at the long line of redcoats assembled to attack the fort. Major General Stalker had ordered his five battalions to form the assault in two lines of attack. The one regular British army regiment, the 64th Foot, were in the front rank, alongside the 2nd Bombay Light Infantry, a regiment of the East India Company’s forces recruited from European rather than native soldiers. Two native regiments, also from the Company’s army, the 20th Bombay Native Infantry and the 2nd Belooch Battalion, formed the second line, with a third native regiment, the 4th Bombay Rifles, positioned out on the left flank. Three thousand men, ordered to attack whatever remained of the Persian defences after the initial bombardment had finished.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As Jack watched, the army’s own gunners opened fire. Two batteries of field artillery and one of horse artillery added their firepower to the barrage fired from the ships crowded close to the shore.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The trenches had now nearly disappeared under a thick cloud of smoke from the countless explosions. Yet it was not hard to imagine the destruction. All along the line, huge explosions threw enormous fountains of soil high into the air, as if some angry god was tearing holes out of the very earth itself. The ground shook with the power of the salvos, the watching redcoats shaken by the force of the barrage that never let up, shell after shell pounding into the enemy’s defences in a remorseless demonstration of the brutal effectiveness of well-directed artillery fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There they go!’ Ballard squinted hard as he peered into the smoke. Shadowy figures were emerging from the battered trenches, moving quickly as the Persians ran to escape the ferocious barrage that was flaying their ranks and destroying their carefully constructed defences.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Still the artillery bombardment continued, tearing though the fleeing troops. It was hard to believe that each wraith-like figure was a living being. It was more like watching a shadow puppet show at the local fair, the spectacle seeming somehow unreal. Dozens of the dark shapes were thrown to the ground, the unceasing explosions gouging huge holes in the smoke, the navy pitiless in the execution of its orders.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Persians were in full flight now. The battered battalions stationed in the trenches were unable to endure the dreadful storm of shot and shell that had torn their ranks apart. All notions of order and defiant defence were forgotten, the shattered bodies of their comrades abandoned without thought as they fled.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Now’s the time.’ Ballard muttered the comment under his breath.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack could see the flush on the major’s cheeks. He suspected this was Ballard’s first taste of battle. Where the sight of the destruction turned Jack’s stomach, Ballard had not yet seen enough to know the same revulsion. Instead, the smell of powder smoke excited him, like a schoolboy before his first rugger match.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Advance!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The brigade major bellowed the command. It was picked up quickly, the battalion officers repeating the order and stirring the five battalions into life.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard turned to Jack as the long red line lurched into motion. ‘Remember your orders, Jack. You are not going to fight, is that clear? Stay out of the way and search for any information that will be of use. You will most likely find it in the fort, so bide your time. When the enemy have been cleared out, go in and look for documents and so on that will tell us something of their plans. And don’t give them time to destroy anything.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded. His throat had gone dry. The pungent powder smoke from the barrage was drifting over the British lines, its acrid tang sour in his mouth. Drums rattled and bugles blared amidst the red-coated ranks as they began the long advance, the bellows and shouts of sergeants and corporals loud even over the cacophony of the bombardment that continued unabated.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was just as Jack remembered. The noise of the cannonade was the same, assaulting the eardrums and reverberating through the very fibre of his being. The fear returned. The icy rush followed by the churn in the guts and the tremor deep in the bowels. The terror of battle wormed its way in, twisting in his belly as he faced the prospect of death. Yet there was also the excitement, the fierce desire to enter the dreadful cauldron of battle and once again prove his worth.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">For Jack, battle was a place he both feared and desired. He was no fool. He knew the reality of war. He had fought enough to understand the sheer horror of the battlefield. He was drawn to it nonetheless, the bitter talent he possessed revealed in the sordid squalor of the fight. Only in battle could he show his true self. Amidst the bloodshed and the death, the shackles would fall away to reveal the steel hidden beneath. In battle, Jack could show he was the leader of men that he knew he could be.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good luck, Jack.’ Ballard tapped him on the shoulder and offered his hand. Jack could see a mix of conflicting emotions on the major’s face. Disappointment at not being involved in the assault combined with relief at not having to face the danger. He shook the hand, feeling the clammy sheen of sweat on Ballard’s fingers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I shan’t need luck. I won’t be fighting, remember.’ Jack forced a grin as he replied. Ballard had ordered him to stay out of the assault, but he knew that anything was possible once a battle had begun. He had loaded his revolver and paid a visit to the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry to have an edge put on his talwar. He had learnt never to go near a fight without being fully prepared, and he had an inkling that somehow he would need his weapons before the day was done.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He stood and waited until the first ranks of redcoats had cleared his position before forcing his body into a trot, heading for the colour party of the 64th. The twin colours were huge, the gaudy, vibrant silk drawing him closer. One was the 64th’s own regimental colour, a huge square of black silk surmounted with the red cross of St George. The other was the battalion’s Queen’s colour, a bright Union Jack with a laurel wreath in the centre, the regiment’s number picked out in golden Roman numerals. Two young ensigns had been given the honour of carrying the colours into action, and they now unfurled their burdens, stirring the thick ash shafts so the silk caught the breeze.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There was grandeur in the spectacle. The two long lines moved forward, the men silent, their faces betraying none of the emotion that stirred inside every one of them. This was how the British army went to war. There was little fanfare, no martial tones used to inspire the troops other than the brazen call of the bugle and the hypnotic rhythm of the drums. The men advanced with calm precision, their eyes focused on their targets, their faces impassive as the assault of Reshire began.</p>
