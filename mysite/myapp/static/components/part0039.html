				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Fusiliers! Fusiliers!’ General Codrington galloped across the slope, his grey Arab pony lathered in sweat. The brigade commander had seen the advance grind to a halt as three battalions traded volleys with two massive Russian columns. Only the King’s Royal Fusiliers were unengaged but that battalion had stopped advancing and now stood impotently halfway up the slope towards the great redoubt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Codrington would not let the attack falter. Standing tall in his stirrups, he waved his old-fashioned bicorn hat, bellowing for the fusiliers’ attention. ‘Fusiliers! King’s Royal Fusiliers! Advance! Advance!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Flowers was the first to respond.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Come on! Follow the general!’ he yelled and spurred his tired horse up the slope. ‘Advance!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Codrington rammed the decrepit bicorn back on to his head. With his right hand now free, he drew his sword, all the while shouting his encouragement over the din of battle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers responded and once again surged up the slope, led by their general and their adjutant. They cheered as they advanced. It was a ragged cry, barely more than a growl, but it released some of their fear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ahead, the great redoubt was ominously silent. The redcoats could see the muzzles of the Russian cannon pointing down the slope. They braced themselves for the twelve Russian guns to fire, a terrible fear building as they got closer to the redoubt. The tension was dreadful. Twelve pieces of artillery would deliver a storm of canister and roundshot that would shred the advancing line, snatching dozens of the fusiliers into oblivion and leaving countless more twitching and bleeding in its wake.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Yet still the redcoats marched forward, their desperate courage and sheer bloody-mindedness pushing them onwards. They marched as if into the face of a violent storm, leaning forward as if battered by a fierce wind, their muscles straining. Their chests heaved with the exertion of the advance, and the pitiless heat of the sun baked them in their thick red jackets.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With four hundred yards to go, a young drummer boy in the centre of the battalion stumbled and fell, his body tumbling over the large drum tethered to his front. The terrified youngster remained on the ground, curling round the broken instrument, hugging it close as he lay weeping and trembling with overwhelming fear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">At three hundred and fifty yards, a fusilier in McCulloch’s company let his rifle slip from his sweating hands. The redcoat marched on regardless, leaving his weapon, terror driving him forward, all rational thought forced from his brain. The discarded rifle lay abandoned, trampled and broken under the heedless boots of the fusiliers that marched behind.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With three hundred yards left to go, the Russian battery fired.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The power of the volley was terrible. The solid roundshot cut through the British ranks, each missile killing several men, the red-hot iron balls passing through successive bodies. Large gaps were blown in the ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The screaming began.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Despite their horrendous casualties, the British line continued forward, heedless of those left behind, stepping over the dead and the dying, callously ignoring the shrieks of agony and the pleas for aid.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The first Russian volley released the tension. The redcoats’ terror was still bright but now the agony of anticipation was over. There was nothing left but to close with the enemy and exact a bitter revenge on the merciless Russian gunners.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The Russian gunners swabbed out the red-hot barrels of their guns, producing hissing clouds of steam, then they frantically rammed and reloaded them. They knew their survival depended on tearing the attacking line to shreds, on slaughtering enough of the British so that the survivors broke and ran rather than face certain death from the guns. If the redcoats got into the battery their revenge would be dreadful. The terrible steel bayonets that glinted so brightly in the sunshine would hack and gouge at the men who had laid down the barrage of fire with such ruthless precision.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian gunners switched to loading canister, a tin can packed full of musket balls that would explode as it emerged from the muzzle of the cannon. It was a brutal weapon, a close-range killing machine.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian guns fired again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack whimpered in terror as the blast of canister tore through the Light Company. Sergeant Adams took a load full in the face. His head exploded before Jack’s horrified eyes, splattering the men around him with blood, brains and scraps of flesh. His body lurched forward like a grotesque headless puppet for another pace before it fell to the ground, blood pouring from the tattered stump of his neck.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">More fusiliers had fallen to the devastating fire. English Davies lay twisted on the ground behind the advancing line, his stomach ripped open, his guts spilling out of the terrible wound to pulse, bloody and blue, in the bright sunshine. At his side, another fusilier screamed abuse at the Russian gunners whose shot had smashed his legs into a vile pulp.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Some fusiliers took their wounds in silence, pressing on even as their blood dripped from their bodies. Lieutenant Thomas wept as he marched, his left arm hanging loosely against his side, the limb shattered and bleeding profusely from a deep wound above the elbow. The subaltern’s tears carved thin channels through his dirt-encrusted face before the young officer smeared them away with his sleeve, more concerned that the men should not see him cry than he was about the severity of the wound.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fusilier O’Callaghan, one of the company’s new recruits, calmly bent to the ground and retrieved his severed arm, ignoring the blood that spurted from the tattered remnant of flesh that had once been his elbow. He turned serenely to begin the long march to the rear, the detached limb cradled carefully in the crook of his surviving arm.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Another volley blasted down the slope. Soldiers littered the ground, corpses tripping the living. Wounded redcoats plucked at the coat tails of those still standing, begging for aid, for water or for a bullet to end their agony.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned away from the horror being wrought on his men, his stomach churning in revulsion. His company was being destroyed before his eyes and he was powerless to stop it. He meant nothing against such destruction. All his ambition and all his hopes washed away in the sea of blood.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Fusiliers had no choice but to advance. If they stopped then they would be slaughtered where they stood. Instinctively they bunched together, unwittingly making the gunners’ work easier. Jack forced himself forward. He wanted to lead from the centre of the battalion line. He knew it was a pathetic gesture but it was one he was determined to make. As he moved, he cast a glance along the ranks, ever hopeful that Slater would have been struck down by the terrible storm.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater noticed Jack’s look and he met his eyes with a cold flat stare. He was covered in blood but it was not his own; the gore belonged to a nearby fusilier who had been torn apart by a burst of canister. Slater spat in derision and Jack looked away, trying to suppress the dread that flared in his soul.</p>
