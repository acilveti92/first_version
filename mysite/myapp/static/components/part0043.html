				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Fire!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack screamed the command. He did not care that he stood in the line of redcoats as a private soldier. He had to rectify Dutton’s dreadful error if they were to stand any chance of survival.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The men of the 24th looked up in surprise as the strange voice shouted the order.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fire! Now!’ Jack twisted on the spot, bellowing the command for all he was worth.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He was roundly ignored.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He saw Dutton’s head snap around, a look of shocked surprise on his face as he heard Jack’s desperate order. For a fleeting moment he caught Jack’s eye, before turning back, his bottom lip reaching up to chew on his thick moustache.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt a hand clap hard on to his shoulder.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Shut your mouth.’ Corporal Jones had been ordered to stand watch over the charlatan in the ranks of the 24th. But there was little force in his warning to be silent. He too was staring in horror at the enemy horde racing towards them. Jack was not the only one sensing that the officers were about to commit a terrible mistake.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack shook off the warning hand. He pulled his musket back into his shoulder and squinted down the sight. The enemy horsemen were dreadfully close, surely no more than fifty yards away from the redcoats’ fragile formation, and closing fast.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">There was no time left.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He pulled the trigger. He felt the kick of the musket as it fired, the stock punching hard into his shoulder.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fire!’ He screamed the command as the crisp cough of his shot died away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">For a single, dreadful heartbeat there was silence.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fuck it!’ Corporal Jones muttered the oath under his breath before sucking in a lungful of the scorching air. ‘Twenty-fourth! Fire!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">This time the redcoats responded. Jack caught a glimpse of the shock on Kingsley’s face as his command opened fire without orders, before the cloud of foul-smelling powder smoke rolled back over the line and hid him from view.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">At such close range, the effect of the volley was terrible. Those enemy horsemen charging the 24th were scythed down, the head of the charge gutted by the deadly accurate musket fire. The heavy balls punched through the flesh of man and beast, killing and maiming indiscriminately. Men shrieked as they were torn apart, adding to the inhuman cries of the horses. More riders and horses went down as they collided with those struck by the close-range fire, the front half of the charging horde reduced to chaos in a heartbeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Reload!’ Colour Sergeant Hughes bellowed the command, taking over the orders that Kingsley should have been delivering. The 24th had taken the bit between the teeth, fighting and killing without command, saving themselves as their officers looked on.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Dutton nearly fell from the saddle when the 24th’s volley roared out.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Damn you! Not yet!’ The major pulled hard on his reins, wheeling his horse around as he shouted in anger.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot kicked his own horse forward, his face twisted into a snarl of recrimination.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You fool! That was Lark!’ He snapped the words with anger.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">But Dutton was no longer looking towards the 24th. Instead he was staring in horror at the horde of enemy horsemen thundering towards them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Oh God!’ The colour fled from his florid face as the full weight of his error struck him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot looked aghast at the commander of his native troops before turning to see just what had caused the major such utter dismay.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The horde of horsemen was no more than twenty yards away. The speed of their advance was mesmerising. They were tearing across the ground, covering the dusty soil far faster than either man would have believed possible.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fire!’ Dutton screamed the command to his own troops, his terror given voice.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The roar of the sepoys’ volley thundered out, the three hundred muskets firing in unison. The wave of sound slammed down the valley an instant after the storm of musket balls drove into the enemy horde.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The volley ripped the leading ranks apart. The riders at the front of the charging cavalry were butchered, the bodies of both man and horse torn apart at such close range. Yet the momentum of the charge was irresistible. Even as they died, the leading riders slammed into the sepoys’ ranks in the thin red line, tearing huge gaps all along its length.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Sepoys went down, limbs twisted and broken by the weight of the dead horses and riders, their terrified shouts cut off as they were struck to the ground. Behind the gutted ranks, dozens of the Maharajah’s irregular cavalry thundered into the dead and dying, their shouts of warning replacing the dreadful keening for blood. Many were thrown to the ground, unable to stop in time, adding to the chaos. Other riders, untouched by the volley, plunged into the maelstrom, forcing their terrified horses through the blood and the confusion. Free from the melee, they gouged their spurs back, throwing their mounts into the gaps that had been torn in the sepoys’ ranks, their talwars flashing bright in the harsh sunlight as they slashed at the heads of the stunned redcoats, who suddenly found themselves easy targets for the surviving horsemen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Major Proudfoot watched in growing horror as he saw Dutton’s men reduced to a broken rabble in no more than a dozen heartbeats.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Arthur! With me!’ he shouted across to Lieutenant Fenris, who was staring in amazement as the British line was torn to shreds before his eyes. ‘Ride, man!’ He didn’t wait to see if his new aide-de-camp heard him. He put his spurs to his horse’s flanks, turning its head and urging it into a gallop.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He would not wait to bear witness to the destruction of his redcoats.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack flinched as the sepoys’ volley roared out. Ahead of him, the 24th’s own volley had bludgeoned the enemy horsemen to a halt, the power of their musket fire smashing the charge into bloody confusion. He could see riders trying to pick their way through the carnage, but it would take time for them to get past the gruesome obstacle. Around him the redcoats reloaded their weapons, their hands moving in haste as they strove to be ready before enough of the enemy riders could break free and once again threaten the frail line.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">It had only been a matter of seconds between the 24th’s volley and that of the native soldiers in the 12th, but already the sepoys were broken. Those left standing huddled together, desperate to find safety with their fellows. The merciless horsemen swarmed around these small islands, leaning down from their saddles, slashing and thrusting their vicious sabres.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">With their flank no longer protected, the 24th was in dreadful danger. They had butchered the riders who had sought to charge them, but if they stayed in line, they stood no hope.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Colour Sergeant Hughes!’ Jack’s voice was huge. ‘Form square!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The tall colour sergeant heard the command. He glanced around for his captain, but Kingsley still stood mute on the company’s right flank, staring in rapt horror at the destruction Jack had ordered.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Now, dammit. Form square!’ Jack repeated his command.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">This time the colour sergeant did not hesitate. ‘Company! Form square!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The redcoats knew their business. The company would reform into square, each flank three ranks deep. The formation would bristle with bayonets, a wall of steel that no horse would be able to penetrate. If they could form it in time and if they remained steady, then they would be safe from the marauding cavalry.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Colour Sergeant Hughes’s command was still echoing around the confined valley when the men of the 24th started to move. With their corporals acting as marshals on the pivot points, the flanks of the square quickly started to form. Ignoring the chaos to their left, the 24th manoeuvred to save itself from destruction.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘What the devil do you think you are doing?’ Jack’s shoulder was yanked backwards and he spun round on the spot to face a furious Captain Kingsley.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Saving your bloody command!’ Jack snapped back, his anger flaring. Around them the square was nearly fully formed, the sergeants and corporals bustling round, positioning their charges to ensure that each of the four flanks was properly aligned.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fix bayonets!’ Colour Sergeant Hughes had moved to the centre of the square, taking command as his officer chose to confront the man who had just saved them from certain destruction.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You bastard.’ Spittle was flung from Kingsley’s lips as he damned Jack. ‘These are my men. Mine, do you hear me?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack glanced through the side of the square nearest the slaughtered horsemen. Already many of the enemy had picked their way through the grotesque barrier and in moments the 24th would be under attack. There was no time to waste.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack did the only thing he could think of. He snapped his fist forward, punching Kingsley square on the point of his chin. The captain’s jaw shut with an audible snap, his head slammed back by the force of the blow. He fell to the ground with all the grace of a sack of horse shit.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was turning away even before Kingsley’s body had stopped moving.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Corporal Jones. Make sure you drag this fool with us. Don’t leave him behind, however tempted you may be.’ Jack nodded as the one corporal he could name doubled over and took a firm grip on Kingsley’s collar.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Colour Sergeant Hughes!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sir!’ Hughes’s reaction was instinctive. Jack might have been dressed as a common redcoat, but there was no doubting who was in command.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘We will make a fighting retreat to the cantonment.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sir.’ A flicker of concern appeared on the colour sergeant’s weather-beaten face. It was a daunting order. The 24th would have to make its way over half a mile of open terrain whilst remaining in square. To keep the ranks tight would have been a hard task even on the parade ground. To accomplish it whilst being harassed by hundreds of horsemen was going to take a Herculean effort.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Have the NCOs watch the files at all times.’ Jack gave his orders calmly, despite the peril of the situation. ‘If we leave a gap, you can bet those bastards will be in here in a flash. If that happens, then we are all dead men.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Very good, sir!’ Hughes nodded his understanding.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The 24th were about to attempt the near impossible. If they failed, they faced being butchered by the merciless horsemen who would soon swarm around them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack had saved them from the first dreadful moments of the enemy’s charge. Now he had to bring them to safety.</p>
