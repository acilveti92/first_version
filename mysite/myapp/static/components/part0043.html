				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack fought against the layers of suffocating darkness that dragged him ever deeper into their dreadful embrace, smothering his will to live. He struggled against their icy grasp, refusing to submit to their clutches, striving to reach the glimmer of light that hovered above him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Gingerly he opened his eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The point of a razor-sharp bayonet glinted less than an inch above his face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Lie still, you dirty little fucker, or I’ll stick you now.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater was on top of Jack’s body, his huge frame pinning him to the ground.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack could feel blood running down the back of his neck into the collar of his uniform coat. His vision misted over with the pain in his head. He gritted his teeth and fought to stay conscious, terrified that passing out would be the last thing he ever did.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good boy. I’m pleased you woke up. I would’ve hated sticking you without you knowing it.’ Slater’s face was so close that his moustache scratched Jack’s cheek. The noxious stench of his foetid breath filled Jack’s nostrils.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater eased the bayonet downwards, inching it steadily lower. Jack could smell the oil on the weapon, the sharp metal tang of the honed edge. Slater brought the blade down until its wickedly sharp point was pressed against the soft underside of Jack’s chin.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The bayonet pierced his skin. Jack felt Slater’s muscles tense as he readied himself to slide the bayonet up through Jack’s jaw and into his brain.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The swing of a black regulation-issue British boot caught Slater above his left temple and knocked him sideways. The breath rushed back into Jack’s lungs as Slater’s huge weight left his chest, followed by a bright flash of pain as the bayonet scored the underside of his chin.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Get up, sir!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s saviour leapt across his prostrate body, aiming another vicious kick at Slater’s head. With reflexes that belied his size, Slater thrust his right arm upwards, taking the kick on his forearm, a hissed oath betraying the pain it inflicted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Jack! Get up!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s hands had instinctively gone to his throat where Slater’s bayonet had drawn blood, convinced his throat had been cut. To his relief, his probing revealed nothing more than a scratch. He was not going to die. Not yet.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Using his elbows as props, Jack lifted his shoulders from the ground. His vision swam and his head protested at the movement. Through his blurred sight, Jack saw Slater roll on to his knees before throwing himself forward, smacking with bone-crunching force into the body of Tommy Smith.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had not seen his orderly in the mad scramble for safety. Yet, even in the confusion and chaos of the retreat, Smith had been keeping watch over his friend.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The two bodies crashed to the ground, wrapped in a violent embrace. Fists flew as the two men writhed in the dirt, punching grabbing and scratching to get the upper hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Smith fought hard, at least twice landing a blow on Slater’s head that would have floored an ordinary man. But Slater was as strong as an ox and shook off the blows. Never before had Smith fought against such strength. He knew he could not take much more of the punishment Slater’s huge fists were dishing out.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He threw his weight forward, ignoring the fists that were aimed with such power, risking everything in a final, reckless effort. For a second he thought the sudden lunge had caught Slater off balance and he pushed with all his might, grasping each of Slater’s forearms in a desperate bid to topple him. But Slater pushed back, returning the pressure, first matching it then overpowering it, so that it was Smith who was forced backwards.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater seized on the opening. He thrust Smith hard into the ground then straddled his body, pulling one arm free from the fallen man’s grasp and delivering a single massive blow to the now unprotected face. Smith’s head lolled backwards, blood streaming from both nostrils. Slater followed the first vicious punch with another, then another. Smith raised his arms to shield his face, relinquishing his hold on Slater’s other arm in his desperation to ward off the succession of vicious punches. With both arms free, Slater went wild, smashing down blow after blow coming away smothered in blood.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stop it!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The voice sounded to Smith as if it was far away but mercifully Slater’s fists stopped their brutal assault.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Get up. Easy now or I’ll blow your damn brains out.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater’s weight eased off Smith’s chest. Gingerly Smith opened his eyes and saw the muzzle of a revolver pressed hard against Slater’s temple.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You took your bleeding time!’ Smith wiped the sleeve of his tunic over his bloody nose and mouth.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I thought you had the measure of him. I didn’t want to spoil your fun.’ Jack’s voice cracked with pain. He was covered in his own blood, the hair on the back of his head was matted and wet, and the dark-blue collar of his jacket was black with it.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’d have killed him if you hadn’t been lying in the fucking way.’ Smith wearily levered himself to his feet and picked up his rifle. The pain was bad but there was no time to dwell on it. Not with Slater still breathing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Smith glanced around. The men from the Light and 2nd Companies had almost all made it to the dead ground Jack had spotted, only a few stragglers were still in sight. The great redoubt was swarming with Russian infantry, and to the south he could see more Russian gun teams heading towards the earthwork. The Russian general was reinforcing his flank, bringing fresh artillery forward.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The three men were dangerously close to the enemy. Russian skirmishers were moving towards them to cover the flanks of the redoubt and clear the last ragtag groups of redcoats that were all that was left of the desperate assault on the redoubt. They would soon be in range. Slater had to be dealt with quickly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Quick, Jack. Shoot the bastard now.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Shoot him?’ Jack sounded genuinely surprised at the idea.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What, do you want to dance with him? Of course shoot him. Before those Russian buggers do it for you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was struggling to think clearly. His mind felt as if it had turned to porridge, so laboured and turgid was his thinking. Slater was licking his lips nervously and his eyes kept swivelling to the side to keep sight of the revolver pressing against his temple. Jack knew Slater would not hesitate to blow his own brains out if the roles were reversed. But to kill a man in cold blood, even one as deserving of death as Slater, was something he could not make himself do. He had seen too much death already today.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Shoot him, Jack, for God’s sake!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Still Jack did not pull the trigger. The danger from the Russian skirmishers increased with every second he delayed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Oh, you stupid bastard. I’ll fucking do it!’ Smith raised his rifle, pulling the heavy lock back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No!’ Jack bellowed as Smith’s finger curled round the trigger of his rifle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A rifle fired, its sharp, barking cough distinctive, but the sound was too distant have come from Smith’s weapon.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The crack of a bullet whipping past his head ended any confusion in Jack’s mind. The first rifle to fire was swiftly followed by another and then another. He had delayed too long. The Russian skirmishers had them in their sights.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was the second bullet fired by the Russian sharpshooters that did all the damage. It hit Tommy Smith on the left cheek, the side of his face that was angled towards the enemy skirmishers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The bullet ripped through skin and bone as if it was not there, tearing away the lower portion of Smith’s face; mouth, lips, nose and chin, all were smashed in a nauseating explosion of blood and flesh.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Smith swayed but stayed on his feet. For one haunting moment, his eyes locked with Jack’s, the gaze betraying the appalling shock of the terrible wound. Then he fell, his hands grasping for the lower half of his face, which was no longer there. He hit the ground and writhed in agony, still alive but unable to scream, his blood gushing from the grotesque wound.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack ran.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Bullets cracked and fizzed past him. He spared no thought for Slater, or for the direction he took. He ran to escape the look of horrified anguish in his orderly’s eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Time slowed. Jack felt as if he were wading through a lake of treacle. Bullets snapped through the air around him but no matter how hard he tried to run, the ground moved with stubborn slowness beneath his feet.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A huge fountain of earth exploded in front of him. The shockwave was tremendous, it snatched Jack from his feet as if he was a mere leaf blown in a gale. Fragments of the exploding shell ripped into his body, lacerating his arms and legs and burning like red-hot pokers. Then he hit the ground with a force that jarred every bone in his body.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With the last scraps of his strength, Jack curled into a ball, his legs pulled right into his stomach, his head buried against his knees. He wrapped himself round his pain and wept.</p>
