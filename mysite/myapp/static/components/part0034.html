				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The sound of rifles firing awoke Jack with an uneasy start.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He scrabbled to his feet, his boots slipping on the damp earth so that his heels gouged thick crevices into the topsoil, a sudden nervous energy searing through his veins. He looked around, his eyes running over the rest of the staff officers, who had made their beds wherever they could, those still at rest looking like so many corpses, their bodies hidden away under their blankets.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He searched for the danger, for the enemy that had appeared to make the sentries open fire. He saw nothing but the miserable faces of exhausted and sodden redcoats. The grimaces and scowls as the bedraggled soldiers in the nearest battalion pulled themselves to their feet and began to prepare for the march. He suddenly understood the rifle fire and sat back heavily on the ground before running his hands over his face, rubbing vigorously in a vain attempt to bring himself to life. Within moments the bugles sounded reveille, the loud call echoing around the barren ground where the battalions had spent the night.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What’s that all about?’ Ballard had not moved. He sat next to Jack, hunched deep into his greatcoat, a horse blanket draped over his shoulders. It was difficult to discern the man huddled underneath.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The sentries are discharging their wet cartridges.’ Jack sighed and forced his aching joints into action, this time taking more care as he began to move. His back ached, the base of his spine on fire as if red-hot pokers jabbed into the very fibre of his being.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard grunted in reply.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Come on.’ Jack turned and offered his commander a hand. ‘Time to get up.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He hauled the major to his feet and the two officers stood in silence as they contemplated the dreary scene around them. The few hours’ rest had done little to revitalise them, the long night hours spent enduring the misery of the thunderstorm that had raged without pause until shortly before dawn.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack busied himself doing his best to brush off the worst of the mucky crust that was caked on to the seat of his overalls. He knew the army faced another long march, the enemy still miles away inland. He remembered his enthusiasm when he had told Outram that the men could advance with ease. Back then, the fifty or so miles had seemed an easy obstacle to overcome. Now, with his body aching and his sodden uniform stuck to his skin, it was hard to see how they could make it to their destination intact, let alone fight a battle when they got there.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">If Ballard’s intelligence had been correct, the enemy was no more than eight miles distant. Outram had gambled everything on a quick dash across country. If the enemy had been forewarned, they would be ready for the British advance. The redcoats would either be forced to fight on ground of the Persian general’s choosing or they would see nothing more than the rearguard of an enemy long gone in flight.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">If the Persians chose to pick a fight, it would be a close-run affair. After the long march, the redcoats were in a poor condition. Tired, battered and outnumbered, they would be forced to assault prepared positions on terrain that would inevitably favour the defender. It would be a hard fight, with defeat as likely an outcome as victory.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But if the gamble had worked, the enemy army would be caught in disarray. The British expeditionary force would be able to sweep forward and force the Persians either to fight unprepared or to flee in chaos and disorder. If they could catch the enemy and bring him to battle quickly and without forewarning, victory was almost assured.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘There they go!’ Ballard twisted in the saddle so he could watch the British cavalry rushing forward. The 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry passed to the left of the column, moving from their position covering the flanks to the front of the now stationary column.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The enemy had been sighted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men had marched with the sunrise. The anticipation of battle had quickened the pace, the troops eager to end the long, wearisome trudge across barren country. Rumours had spread swiftly. Every redcoat now knew that the Persian encampment was only a few miles ahead. Yet no one, not even the commander-in-chief, knew whether the enemy was waiting, ready for their arrival, or whether they had been thrown into chaos by the sudden appearance of the invading army.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Staff officers put their spurs to the sides of their horses, a sudden bustle replacing the calm of the morning march. Orders needed to be delivered to the brigade and battalion commanders to move the battalions out of the marching column and into the long lines in which they would engage the enemy. The junior officers whose role it was to deliver these messages burst away from the huddle of senior officers, each one puffed up with self-importance as they went on their vital errands.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘May I go with them?’ Jack chafed at his impotence. He had fidgeted in the saddle as the blue-coated cavalry had ridden past, the sudden flurry of activity infectious.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No you may not.’ Ballard let out a disapproving humph at his subordinate’s suggestion. ‘Must I remind you of your proper station again?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack sighed and settled into the saddle, letting his horse’s reins go limp. ‘No.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You sound like a petulant child.’ Ballard smiled at Jack’s pathetic expression. ‘You will have soon have things to do. We will be called upon again.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack sat straighter in the saddle as he peered ahead. He could not make out the enemy. All he could see was the cloud of dust kicked up by the fast-moving horses of the light cavalry rushing forward to drive off the enemy vedettes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘This is a gloomy place for a battle.’ Ballard chewed his lip and looked at the terrain to the sides of the column. The high hills were certainly forbidding. They had funnelled the advance, forcing the column to march directly for the enemy’s encampment at Borãzjoon. There was no room for deft manoeuvre, for the subtlety of a flanking march. A handful of men could hold off an army in the hills, the narrow gullies and ravines a nightmare for an attacking force. Outram had had to order the advance on the flatter ground between the hills. It was his only choice, but it meant the army would have few options when they came across the enemy. If the Persians knew they were coming, the fight would be brutal in its simplicity.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Maybe the enemy chose it that way.’ Jack enjoyed the grim comment. It was his way of paying Ballard back for his refusal to let him join the cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Perhaps.’ Ballard lifted his hussar’s busby with its glorious eight-inch scarlet osprey feather plume before settling it back in a more comfortable fashion on his head. ‘Perhaps they are not ready for us.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They had better not be. Outram would have my guts for garters.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I think you take too much on yourself.’ Ballard smiled, enjoying his own turn to send a barb towards his fellow intelligence officer. ‘I rather fancy the general had his own ideas. I doubt you swayed his mind.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack scowled. ‘Perhaps.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard laughed and then fell silent, cocking an ear as he listened intently. The sound of rifle fire rippled down the column, echoing around the empty hillsides.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The huge voices of the regimental sergeant majors followed the gunfire, and the column shook itself into life. With all the precision and martial splendour of the parade ground, the battalions manoeuvred into line. The left-hand column would form the second rank, the right-hand column the first. With the drummers marking out the time, the hundreds of red-coated soldiers swung into the formation they would use to attack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Each battalion formed into a line two men deep. With four battalions in the first line and three more in the second, the army snaked across the plain, the exposed flanks protected by the limited number of cavalry at Outram’s disposal. The battalions’ skirmishers broke from the formed ranks and took their place to the front of the tightly packed line, ready to screen it from any enemy skirmishers. The tactics Outram employed had changed little since the days of Wellington and the battles fought in Portugal, Spain and France. Manufacturing had improved the weaponry, the Enfield rifles carried by the regular British army regiments more powerful than any weapon previously brought to the field of battle. Yet their leaders clung to the anachronistic principles of a dead general and the battles he had fought over forty years earlier.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British line bustled with purpose. This was what they had come all this way to do. The redcoats looked at one another as they heard the sounds of fighting ahead, the men of the light cavalry and the rifle battalion that formed the vanguard of the army already engaging the enemy’s troops. Soldiers fiddled with their equipment, making sure everything was just so, their fears building as the order to advance rippled down the line.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Each man’s belly squirmed with terror, the clammy hand of death suddenly present at every shoulder. Faces flushed with the exertion of the march paled as they contemplated what was to come, the thought that these might be their last minutes on earth sending icy flushes through their veins.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The battalion colours were unfurled. The gaudy silk caught the morning light, the bright reds, blues and golds adding grandeur to the display. To the beat of the drum the lines marched forward. The sight was like a grand painting, the long, steady rows of grim-faced soldiers marching into battle with stoic grace.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The rifle fire died out.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men sucked in their breath and stiffened their sinews as they braced themselves for battle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A flurry of staff officers galloped past the marching redcoats, the sudden activity sending a spurt of excitement flashing through the tight ranks. Sergeants and corporals bellowed at their charges as heads turned to watch the fast-moving gallopers. Yet the whispers flowing through the battalions were impossible to stop.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘What the devil is going on?’ Ballard twisted and turned in the saddle as he tried to watch all of the sudden comings and goings around him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A cornet from the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry galloped into the gaggle of officers clustered around Outram. His light blue tunic was covered in a fine layer of dust and streaks of sweat had carved thin channels in the layer of grime coating his face. The young officer handed a scrap of paper to the general, his horse skittish as it was forced to an abrupt halt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack leant forward in the saddle as he tried to listen to what was being said. He and Ballard sat close to Outram’s staff, on the periphery of the officers charged with running the day’s affair. Without any direct involvement, they had no more idea what was going on than the humblest redcoat marching in the centre of his battalion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I cannot hear.’ Jack’s face twisted in vexation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The cornet was on the move once more. He had snatched an order from the hand of Captain Hunter before forcing his mount into a tight turn and beginning the long, fast ride back to the vanguard. Another half-dozen staff officers left in the moments that followed, each bearing a fresh message for the brigade commanders.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Something’s up.’ Jack slapped his thigh in frustration.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Your powers of deduction are a wonder, Jack.’ Ballard scowled as his irritation threatened to boil over. He hated not knowing what was happening.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had opened his mouth to reply when a new series of orders were bellowed out in the nearest battalion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They were orders to halt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The attack was being reined in. The redcoats’ fears had been unfounded. There would be no fighting. No great battle to mark the start of the campaign.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The enemy had fled.</p>
