				<p id="toc_marker-31" class="toch-table-of-contents-main-head"><img class="image29" src="../images/00031.jpeg" alt="Chapterheads.pdf"/></p>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The sand got everywhere. It chafed against the redcoats’ skin, the seams of their trousers turned into abrasive weapons of torture that scoured the delicate flesh from their bodies and made every step an unrelenting agony. It filled their eyes, leaving them red raw and sore, the men blinking and squinting in the fierce early-morning light. The sand had become the enemy, its painful presence adding to the misery of the long advance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The columns marched on, the officers relentless as they drove their commands forward, ignoring the complaints and the men who slid silently from the ranks, their bodies dragged out of the line of march lest they be crushed under the merciless boots of their comrades. These unfortunate souls were abandoned to the musicians from the battalions’ bands, who had stowed their instruments so that they could take up their secondary role as stretcher-bearers. The fallen were taken to the surgeons and the pitifully small collection of bullock-pulled wagons, their passing unremarked amongst their fellows, who could do nothing but march onwards, forcing out step after step, the need to cover the distance overriding the need for compassion. The long columns had walked through the night, carrying on until the sun touched the horizon, the men waiting stoically for the order to halt. Still they marched on, advancing into the morning sunlight, forcing their aching bodies onwards, the miles crawling past.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was nine o’clock before the command to halt was passed along the line. The exhausted men had no energy for the horseplay that would usually follow a march or the banter that would see them find something to laugh about no matter how dreary their temporary home. The exhausted redcoats slumped to the ground, even the rock-hard soil a welcome respite after the hours they had spent, heads down, grinding through the miles. They would spend the day where they were, the men left to pile their weapons and seek what respite they could whilst still remaining in the order of march. They had covered nearly twenty-six miles, but they were barely over halfway.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men lay down and rested, baked by the sun, waiting for evening. Waiting for the command to march once more.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Late in the afternoon, the battalions formed up. The twin columns snaked back across the barren plain like two lines of red ants, the sense of the individual lost in the vastness of the whole.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The drummer boys picked up their sticks before rattling them against the taut skin of their instruments, beginning the mesmerising rhythm of the march that would continue until the men were finally allowed to march easy. The two columns lumbered into life. Like a pair of enormous beasts they lurched forward, the braying voices of the sergeants rippling along the ranks as they forced their men to order.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As if at a secret signal, the weather changed. What had been a clear blue sky darkened as the redcoats slipped into the rhythm of the march. Huge banks of dark grey-blue clouds rolled in from the horizon, smothering the last of the sun’s rays and casting an ominous shadow over the advancing troops.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men marched in silence. Heads down. Trudging through the miles.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In the gloom there was little to see, the few trees and olive groves soon lost in the darkness. The men could only make out their fellows, their world reduced to nothing more than the back of the man in front and the heavy sand beneath their feet. The only sound the thump of their boots hitting the hard-baked soil, the jangle of their equipment and the occasional rasp as men forced air into their tired, aching lungs.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The last of the light was soon gone and the redcoats advanced into the night. They marched on, each man surrounded by hundreds of fellow soldiers, yet still alone.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A single voice began to sing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It came from the ranks of the 64th, the lead battalion in the left-hand column, and cut through the silence that had settled heavily over the redcoats, like a single ray of sunshine piercing a storm cloud.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"><span class="char-style-override">‘And to my heart in anguish pressed, the girl I left behind me.’</span></p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men recognised the words. The voice sang them well, the purity of the sound only wavering as its owner drew breath. The notes of the familiar tune flowed over the marching troops, a balm that soothed away the misery of the relentless advance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"><span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">‘I shared the glory of that fight, sweet girl I left behind me.’</span></p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A deeper voice picked up the melody. The two voices sang together, the words blending, the tones merging into one. More men joined in, the song spreading quickly through the tight-packed ranks. They sang softly, using the music to lift their flagging spirits.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"><span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">‘Dishonour’s breath shall never stain, the name I leave behind me.’</span></p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Knightly closed his mouth and listened to what he had started, the men picking up the tune and taking it for their own. The redcoats sang well. They kept their voices low, but the song settled over the noise of the march so that the tramp of heavy boots was lost in the beautiful lament.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">When it ended, the men fell silent once more, sharing the moment, each thinking his own thoughts, savouring his own memories. The feeling of camaraderie was complete, and Knightly was not sure he had ever experienced an emotion as pure or as heartfelt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Then a loud voice in the centre of the column lifted to bellow the first lines of ‘Cheer Boys Cheer’ and the spell was broken. The men hooted aloud before joining in with gusto, the deep, sombre melody replaced by the raucous joy of bellowing out the cheerful song.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly smiled at his men’s spirit. His redcoats could take anything. He knew that he would never fully understand their indomitable spirit. They came from the meanest of backgrounds – they were the dregs of society, the flotsam and jetsam, the scum from the jails and the boys from the workhouse – yet they were willing to fight and die for their country. As they cheered their own singing prowess, their faces betraying the simple delight of being with their mates, he remembered what Fenris had told him about the responsibility of leading the men, of putting them first, even over his own life. To fail them was becoming unthinkable, no matter what the cost.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">It was long after night had fallen that the redcoats were ordered to halt. Once more they would seek their rest in the order of march, so that they were ready to advance with the first light of the new day.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They were not to be left to rest in peace.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Thunder rolled across the sky, the deep, resonating crashes echoing through the empty landscape, the ominous booms rousing even the most exhausted man from his rest. Lightning followed, slashing through the darkness, the brilliant flashes searing the sky into temporary daylight before plunging it back into an all-enveloping blackness. It was a display of raw power, the forces of nature providing a spectacle of natural violence.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Then came the rain.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It fell in solid sheets, a deluge that soaked the redcoats to the skin. Without shelter, the men could do nothing but endure the tempest as best they could, each man’s misery self-contained, bodies wrapped in their greatcoats, faces hidden under their shakos. They sat in silent misery and waited for dawn, looking to the sky and wondering at the power of the gods. Asking themselves if the angry display was a prophecy; a dire warning of what was to come.</p>
