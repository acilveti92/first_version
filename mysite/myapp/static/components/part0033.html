				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Few men were woken by the harsh notes of the reveille. Many were already up and about, abhorring the idea of wasting what could be their last living hours in sleep. The quiet murmur of voices could be heard throughout the army, some in conversation with their fellows, others in prayer, even those most vehement atheists returning to the comforting words of religion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sun rose lethargically as if it, too, was unwilling to start the day. The morning was chilly, the men and their uniforms damp from the heavy dew. Fires were coaxed into life and the men breakfasted on salt pork and biscuit. Then it was time to form up.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">By six thirty, the men stood ready in their ranks, waiting for the command to march. Their coats steamed gently under the climbing sun. Horses pawed at the ground and flicked their tails, the men fidgeted. And waited.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">By seven thirty, there was still no order to advance. Exasperated officers decided enough was enough and ordered their men to sit. The men sank gratefully to the ground and the officers gathered to vent their frustration at the maddening delay and the incompetence of their seniors.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Digby-Brown!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The lieutenant heard his captain’s loud summons and reluctantly left the circle of subalterns. Already he was sweating profusely, his thin whiskers slick from the steady stream that ran down from underneath his shako.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Nothing is going to be happening here for a while so I’m of a mind to see what lies ahead. I’m leaving you in charge of the company. I’ll return should the generals condescend to present us with orders to advance.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Very good, sir.’ Digby-Brown licked his lips nervously as he risked a request. ‘Would you mind if I came with you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, I would.’ Jack wanted to get away from the cloying attention of his fellow officers. Taking Digby-Brown with him would be as bad as joining in one of their pointless discussions.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown’s shoulders slumped at the unkind reply. ‘Very good, sir. Any other commands?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. Stay with the men and send someone to me if I’m needed.’ Jack made to leave.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I think I might just about be able to manage that, sir.’ Digby-Brown’s words stopped Jack in his tracks. ‘It’s just the task for a hopeless lieutenant.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What on earth do you mean by that?’ Jack snapped.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, it’s clear you don’t like me. You treat me like something you’ve just trod in.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I have no idea what you mean.’ Jack could see the emotion in his junior officer’s face and it brought him up short.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Truly?’ Digby-Brown’s eyes glistened. ‘You never have a good word to say to me. You treat me like a fool.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t think you are a fool – except when you come up with daft notions like this.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘With respect, sir, I disagree. I’ve tried my best to help you. Yet whatever I do, you show me nothing but scorn and derision. It is grossly unfair.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Listen, Digby-Brown. This is the neither the time nor the place for this.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I think it is exactly the time, sir. There may not be another chance to speak plainly.’ The young lieutenant paled at the thought of his own mortality.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, consider your views aired and noted. Your function in my company is to assist me as I see fit. If that is unsatisfactory to you then I can arrange for you to be assigned elsewhere. For God’s sake, man, we are about to go into battle. This is not the time for a fit of the vapours.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown’s shoulders slumped and he lowered his head, his spark of righteous anger extinguished by Jack’s damning words.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sight of the crestfallen officer pricked Jack’s conscience. ‘Look here, Digby-Brown. I need you to help me. Do you understand?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You need me, sir? I thought you couldn’t stand the sight of me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Grow up, man. Of course I need you. I can’t do everything myself. The men will look to both of us to show them what is expected of them. For better or worse we are their officers and it’s up to us to live up to their expectations.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Digby-Brown’s head lifted. ‘I would like to apologise for my outburst.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Now you’re being a damn fool.’ Jack clapped Digby-Brown on the shoulder. He knew he had treated his lieutenant harshly. He had used the young officer as an undeserving scapegoat for all his loathing towards the officer class. He saw now how his treatment had affected Digby-Brown and for that he did feel a pang of remorse. He had not set out to be such a bastard.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You have all the makings of a fine officer,’ Jack told him. ‘Never let anyone tell you different. Now,’ he summoned a wry smile, ‘get to your bloody duties before I change my mind.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Digby-Brown glowed with delight, the unexpected praise helping to settle the fear that sat heavily in his stomach. ‘And thank you, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned and made his way up the small hillock a few hundred yards in front of the fusiliers’ position. At the top he pulled up handfuls of heather and weeds to make a cushion that would spare his backside direct contact with the damp ground. Then he turned his attention on the panorama that stretched towards the southern horizon.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Directly to the south was a ridge and it was carpeted with thousands upon thousands of Russian infantry. Unlike the allied army, the enemy had yet to form up. Sunlight glinted on the infantry’s neatly piled arms and reflected off the hundreds of pieces of artillery whose iron barrels were aimed down the slope towards the Alma River.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack slowly panned along the enemy’s position, Sloames’s precious field glasses bringing the Russian men sharply into focus. He watched intrigued as individual soldiers wandered down to a thick band of vegetation that lined the banks of the river. He picked out one scrawny Russian conscript who meandered down to where a thick clump of bushes would screen him from his fellows. The Russian had not reckoned on being observed from far away to the north and Jack had a clear view as he dropped his thick grey trousers and squatted down on to his haunches.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack held the man in view. He counted the seconds, deciding that if the Russian was still emptying his bowels after the count of thirty then Slater would die that day. Jack knew it was superstitious nonsense but he could not help feeling hopeful as he reached twenty.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">At the count of twenty-seven, the Russian soldier abruptly stood up and hoisted his trousers over his skinny shanks. Jack swore loudly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Annoyed at his own stupidity, he turned away from observing the Russian line. He shuffled round on his scratchy seat so he could observe the preparations of his own side. The sight of the massed ranks of the allied army astounded him, it stretched for miles; the allied force was far greater than even the huge number he had observed in the Russian lines.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Officers galloped between the formations, full of activity despite the fact that the army was sprawled immobile on the ground. To the rear, the last of the ammunition wagons made their way forward, harried by mounted officers who bellowed at the cart drivers to make swifter progress. Around the Bulganak, the army’s pioneers wielded shovels to level the riverbanks and make the passage across the river as easy as possible for the thousands of infantrymen, cavalry, artillery and supply troops that would have to cross its winding course.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sound of bugles and drums reached Jack’s hillock. The French army was stirring into life far away on the right flank of the allied force. Once again, it appeared that the French were ready to fight while their British allies still laboured in their preparations. Jack watched the first French brigades start their advance towards the steep cliffs that protected the Russian general’s left flank. Perhaps the French commander, Saint-Arnaud, was as tired of waiting for the British generals as their own army was.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The movement seemed to spur the British high command to life. A fresh flurry of staff officers left the clump of generals at the heart of the British formation and raced their horses through the massed ranks of the army, a new urgency in their hurried passage. As Jack watched through his field glasses, the massive columns of infantrymen slowly rose to their feet, and the small clusters of officers broke up and returned to their commands.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was now mid-morning but at last the British army was about to advance.</p>
