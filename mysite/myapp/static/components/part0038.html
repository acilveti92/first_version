				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The enemy came out of the blackness. Their screams echoed across the plain, drowning out the sound of their galloping horses. The cries swirled around the British rearguard so that it seemed as if they were being attacked from all sides. The suddenness of the attack shook the men of the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry. They had expected a dull, routine march back to Bushire. They were roused from their lethargy by an eruption of violence, the vicious war cries of the Persian cavalry leaving no doubt that their complacency had been ill founded.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The column was under attack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The first shots rang out. They snapped through the air, stinging past the ears of the light cavalry protecting the last of the marching infantry. The gunfire drove any indecision from the minds of the officers charged with the security of the column. It was time for action. The rearguard would be the first to fight, their job to protect the column long enough for the infantry to re-form and face the enemy threat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fenris! With me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack heard Captain Forbes bellow his name. He turned his horse round and spurred it hard, chasing after the commander of the Bombay Lights. He had been lost in his thoughts, imagining his reunion with Sarah Draper, even though it would likely mean another clash with her arrogant prig of a brother. He emerged from his reverie to the chaos of an ambush.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He saw fast-moving shapes in the darkness as the enemy swarmed around the rearguard. The Persians were screaming and yelling like fiends, the dreadful cries seeming somehow inhuman, as if the column was under attack from the denizens of another world. Their frantic trumpets blared out, the strange calls piercing his ears and scattering his thoughts as he tried to make sense of the confusion that had erupted from the dark.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He reined in hard next to Forbes. There was just enough moonlight to make out the light blue tunics of the troopers as they re-formed their ranks to face outwards into the night. He saw Moore, the adjutant, riding away from his commander, bearing away the first report of the contact to the senior officers who would need to know of the sudden threat to the marching column.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Take number five and six troop; protect the left flank.’ Forbes snapped the order at Jack. Another flurry of shots stung the air around them and both officers flinched, the sudden strain of being under fire written large on their faces. ‘The Poona Horse have the right flank. I shall hold the rest of the regiment here to protect the rear. Is that all clear?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir.’ Jack acknowledged the order. He was about to ram his spurs back when Forbes grabbed his shoulder.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And for God’s sake keep the enemy away from the column. Whatever it takes, we cannot let them past.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded and galloped towards the ranks of the Bombay Lights.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Five and six troop with me.’ He glanced along the length of the line and saw the older Moore acknowledge the order. He looked for the officer in charge of the other troop he had been ordered to command. A thin-faced lieutenant raised his hand: John Malcolmson, an officer Jack barely knew. It was a pity their introduction to one another would come in such dangerous circumstances.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He brought his horse to a stand so he could watch his men as they responded to his orders. The animal pranced and skittered, sensing the building tension, and Jack had to work hard to keep it in hand. He forced the beast into a tight circle and observed the daffadars issuing the orders to their men as they prepared to take the two troops out of the formation. He looked for signs of panic or confusion but the men responded calmly, their stony faces betraying none of the excitement the sudden attack must surely have caused. He was impressed. He just hoped they were as calm in a fight.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Follow me!’ Jack waved his arm and signalled the two troops to move to the left flank. His horse tried to gallop away and he was forced to haul on the reins to keep it in hand. He heard the drumming of hooves behind him as the troops followed his command, and he hoped the darkness saved the men from seeing their commander wrestling to control his horse like a raw recruit fresh from the depot.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He led the men quickly towards the column’s left flank, or at least where he believed the left flank to be. In the darkness it was nigh on impossible to know exactly where anyone was. He brought them into position, formed into a single line two men deep so that they could screen the tail of the column from attack. He could hear the first shouted orders as the infantry awoke to the sudden threat. They would need time to re-form. In the column of march, they would be unable to fight back and repel the sudden ambush. The formation was perfect for advancing across country, the men moving in one solid, compact oblong. But it was vulnerable to attack. They needed to reorganise themselves into a square, the one formation that would protect them from the ravages of enemy horsemen. With a wall of bayonets facing out on all four sides, the infantry would be secure, the ring of steel certain to force any attacking cavalry to veer away. It was a tactic that had worked for Wellington, and it would work for the British generals who had learnt from the old duke.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The light cavalry would have to buy the infantry the time they would need to complete the change in formation, no matter what it cost them. If they failed, the infantry would be easy targets for the hard-riding Persian cavalry. They would be butchered, the mournful retreat turned into a rout, the campaign coming to a bloody end with an ignominious defeat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A bugle sounded from the darkness. Its rising call demanded attention, the signal to retire clear even over the dreadful cacophony of the enemy’s screams and yells.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked in every direction, trying to find the source of the urgent call. He twisted in the saddle and saw his own trumpeters lifting their instruments to their mouths, their instincts telling them to echo the order.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Hold fast!’ he bellowed. The rising call came again, the notes sounding with absolute clarity. There was no mistaking the command.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Should we retire?’ Lieutenant Moore had raced forward so that he could call to Jack. His face was etched with tension.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. It’s a trick!’ Jack forced himself to smile. ‘Hold the men here. Two lines, facing west. Quick, now. We are not going to stay here for long. We need to drive these bastards off.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Moore looked at Jack, a moment of doubt showing in his expression, before he turned away and bellowed the orders to the two troops.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack could feel dozens of eyes boring into his back as he tried to discern the enemy in the darkness. He was sure he had made the correct decision. He had read enough reports of the Persian army to know that they had been trained for many years by British officers. It was natural to assume that the enemy trumpeters would know the British army’s bugle calls, and he was certain that the command to retire had come from out of the darkness and not from the direction of the British column. He pushed the doubts away and summoned the courage to trust his instincts. He would not obey the orders of the enemy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A volley of gunfire shattered the calm. The bullets whistled past him, the air suddenly alive with the storm of deadly missiles. A single trooper slumped from the saddle, his left arm shattered by a ball fired from an enemy carbine. The darkness was saving the men from taking more casualties. The enemy horsemen were armed with carbines, and were wasting their time delivering weak volleys of gunfire when they should have been pressing home their attack and relying on cold, hard steel. Jack intended to show them just how light cavalry should fight, a demonstration that he hoped would shatter the enemy’s ranks and buy the British column some much-needed time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Draw sabres!’ He faced his new command, parading his horse in front of the troopers, showing them that he was braving the danger. There was enough moonlight filtering through the thin clouds for them to see their new captain, to witness the example he was trying to set.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt his shoulder blades twitch as he turned his back on the enemy. A cold rush of fear surged down his spine before settling in the nagging pain in the small of his back. He forced it from his mind, concentrating on watching his men. He might have only just learnt the sequences of commands the British cavalry employed, but this was what he was used to. He knew how to fight.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sabres flashed in the meagre light. The Bombay Lights were issued with straight, heavy swords. They were brutal weapons, the steel capable of cutting through a man’s flesh with ease. The troopers endured countless hours of training as they built up the strength they would need to be able to wield the swords effectively in combat. A skill Jack was about to put to the test.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He studied the ranks of faces staring towards him, his eyes roving across the men who had fallen under his command. He saw their determination, the grim set of their jaws as they braced themselves for what was about to come. Moore had ordered them into two lines, each two men deep. The second line had pushed to the rear, leaving a gap between it and the front rank. The men had re-formed quickly, without fuss. For the first time, Jack felt a spark of pride at leading them into battle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He drew his own sword. The talwar rasped from the scabbard and he brandished it high in the air, letting every man see the fabulous weapon.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A young trooper rode forward, taking his place at Jack’s side. His face was pale in the darkness, his eyes wide. He held a trumpet in his hand, and Jack could see the whites of the boy’s knuckles as he held the instrument in a vice-like grip.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stay close, lad. Watch for my command.’ Jack spoke softly so that only the young trumpeter could hear him. He looked into the boy’s eyes and saw the fear bright inside them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slowly and deliberately he turned his horse on the spot so that he once again faced the darkness. He could see the shadowy forms of the enemy horsemen as they prowled around the rearguard. It told him all he needed to know.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He lowered his sword, pointing it forward.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Bombay Lights!’ His voice was huge, his hidden terror given voice. ‘March!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He tapped his heels into the flanks of his willing horse, keeping the bit rammed hard into the animal’s mouth, curbing its instincts to race away. The two lines of cavalry lurched into motion behind him, the men obeying his orders without hesitation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Trot!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The rhythm of the hooves pounding into the sun-baked soil changed as the men hastened their speed. The line was moving rapidly now, pulling away from the rearguard, advancing into the dark.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Gallop!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack pushed his spurs backwards, urging his horse on yet still keeping the bit hard in its mouth, holding it back, keeping it in hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Charge!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was supposed to give the final command when the enemy was no more than forty to fifty yards distant. In the darkness, it was impossible to tell, but he screamed the order anyway, the need to close with the enemy overriding the need for precision.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He racked his spurs back and finally let the bit fall loose, giving the horse its head. The valiant animal threw itself forward. The young trumpeter echoed the order, his instrument blaring the notes of the charge as he raced after his commander.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack galloped into the darkness. The movement was mesmerising, the motion of the horse’s gait sending a rush of exhilaration flushing through his veins and banishing the last of his fear. He heard the sound of hundreds of hooves hitting the ground as the two troops followed his lead and felt a heady rush of excitement, the intoxication of the charge like nothing he had ever experienced.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He looked ahead and saw the shapes of the enemy horsemen scattering in every direction as the sudden charge took them by surprise. He sensed the panic engulfing the Persians, the reversal in fortune so quick that it snatched away their initiative in a heartbeat. He felt the flare of success. He was doing what he did best.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A shadowy shape flashed towards him. Without thought, he changed the angle of his horse’s charge, his body reacting just as it had been trained to do so many months ago. He brought his talwar around, acting on instinct, slashing the blade forward, slicing it across the back of the body that had erupted from the darkness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His arm jerked with the impact. He felt the blade slide through flesh before it bounced off bone. He caught the impression of an enemy rider being thrown from the saddle before he was past, the speed of his horse’s gallop taking him away from the man he had slain.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He heard a visceral thump as his men hit the loose formation of the enemy. They swept on with barely a pause, scything the Persian riders from their saddles, their heavy swords battering the enemy into bloody ruin.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There was no time for anything more than the brutal collision. Jack knew he had to halt his men almost immediately. He could not afford for them to become scattered, their cohesion broken as they chased down the enemy horsemen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Walk!’ He bellowed the command, immediately reining in hard, slowing the mad headlong rush. The two troops had covered the ground fast and already they were some distance from the column they were protecting. The young trumpeter drew up beside him, his instrument already pressed to his lips.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack lifted his arm high, signalling his command. ‘Sound the halt!’ He snapped off the order.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The two troops came to a breathless standstill as the bugle called for them to stop. Jack flashed a smile at his trumpeter. In the darkness, the boy’s instrument was vital as the only practical way of issuing commands to his men, the youngster’s skill the only thing between him and chaos.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack twisted in the saddle, taking one last look into the darkness. There was no sign of the enemy riders. He nodded at the trumpeter. ‘Signal retire.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was time to rejoin the column. The Bombay Lights had scattered the enemy troops. They had bought their comrades some time to re-form. For the moment, that was all they could do.</p>
