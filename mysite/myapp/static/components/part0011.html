<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter006">SIX</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">The Divinity School was the most breathtaking building I had yet seen in Oxford; inside its high wooden doors a magnificent fan-vaulted ceiling of blond stone arched over a plainly furnished room perhaps ninety feet long, bathed in natural light from the ten great arched windows that reached from floor to ceiling the full length of the room, so that the north and south walls seemed almost entirely of glass. These windows were surmounted by elegant tracery and their panes decorated with designs of coloured shields and heraldic devices of benefactors and university dignitaries, according to the custom. From the supporting arches at the top of the windows the ribs of the vault fanned out in symmetrical patterns across the ceiling before dovetailing again in points decorated with elaborately carved bosses and pendants inset with statues, drawing the eye constantly upward and inward to the centre. There was a pungent smell of warm wax from the plentiful candles, lamps and torches that had been set blazing along the walls, and their light was welcome despite the grand windows, for the sky was still overcast and the day already fading.</p>
<p class="indented">At the west end of the hall a stage had been erected and high-backed chairs set with plump velvet cushions placed there for the most eminent persons – the palatine sat in the centre, with Sidney on his left side and the vice-chancellor in his ermine-trimmed robes on his right, their chairs surrounded by the other university dignitaries in their crimson and black gowns and the velvet caps of professors, ranged according to their degree. Below this, tiered seating had been built facing the length of the hall towards the east doorway, and was now filled with the figures of senior men in Fellows’ gowns, while in the second of the five grand bays from the west end, two carved wooden pulpits were set opposite one another on the north and south walls, where Doctor Underhill and I now prepared to take up our positions for the confrontation.</p>
<p class="indented">Further towards the eastern end, rows of low benches had been set out for the undergraduates, who were even now still pouring into the hall, jostling and shoving one another to take their places amid a great murmur of animated conversation. For a moment my stomach tightened as I mounted the steps to the lectern that was to be my platform for the next hour, but as I cast my eyes over the expectant rows of faces I was buoyed up again by the old thrill of public performance, my first in England, and found I was anticipating the coming debate just as a sportsman might relish the challenge of a good fencing match.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">I glanced at the stage to my left and caught Sidney’s eye; he winked encouragement. The palatine slumped next to him, legs akimbo, picking his teeth with his thumbnail and examining whatever he extracted with more interest than he seemed prepared to devote to the coming argument. I noticed Coverdale, Slythurst and William Bernard sitting in the centre of the second row; Coverdale cast only a brief glance at me with complete composure, while Slythurst allowed his cold gaze to slide over me before pointedly turning away. Bernard cracked his bony hands together and nodded to me once; I chose to interpret this as encouragement. Doctor Underhill climbed his podium opposite and leaned forward over his lectern, fixing me with a combative stare. A stillness fell over the assembled crowd. I cleared my throat.</p>
<p class="flush-left">Earlier that afternoon, at a quarter to five, a student had been sent to escort me to the Divinity School from my chamber, a stocky and sensible-looking undergraduate with dark hair who introduced himself as Lawrence Weston and explained that the rector had sent him to show me the way to the place of our disputation, as he, the rector, had gone on ahead. This seemed a courteous gesture, and I followed young Weston across the quadrangle to the tower gatehouse. As we drew nearer, I noticed two servants coming from the tower-room staircase hefting a large wooden chest between them; behind them followed another, his arms laden with books.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They are clearing Doctor Mercer’s belongings already?’ I asked Weston, trying not to reveal the alarm in my voice. The boy shrugged, as if the matter were not for the likes of him to question.</p>
<p class="indented">Outside, in St Mildred’s Lane, we came upon Cobbett the porter, who stood looking on as his old dog pissed copiously against the wall of the college.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Afternoon, Doctor Bruno!’ he called cheerfully, raising a hand in salute. ‘Off to bandy words with the rector?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Buona sera</em>, Cobbett.’ I gestured casually to the gatehouse behind us. ‘I see they are clearing the tower room.’</p>
<p class="indented">Cobbett chuckled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They don’t hang about with these matters, the senior rooms are great prizes here. Doctor Coverdale wants to move in as soon as possible.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He is to take over as sub-rector, then?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It’s not official yet, but that won’t stop him. Come on, now, Bessie, home again.’ The old dog had finished her business and was hobbling painfully towards the gate, Cobbett ushering her gently along. ‘Oh, by the bye, Doctor Bruno – here is another mystery for you …’ He grinned, showing decayed gums.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is that?’ I turned back, eager for information.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That spare key to Doctor Mercer’s room I said had been taken from my lodge – well, Master Slythurst brought it to me this morning. Found it on the north-west staircase just outside the tower room, he says. Whoever took it must have let it fall there the day before and not noticed – it is gloomy on those stairs at the best of times. Well, at least I have the full complement back again ready for our new sub-rector.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘On the staircase? But how did the bursar come to find it there?’ I asked, wondering how Slythurst had covered this lie.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I suppose he was on his way to the strongroom.’ He shuffled to the gate and pushed it open, then turned back to me. ‘Good luck with your disputation, sir,’ he added. ‘And may the best man win.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you,’ I said, but I was distracted by this new information. It now seemed almost certain that Slythurst had taken that missing key and used it to let himself into Mercer’s room: if he had truly been there on official business he would have had no need to confect such a story for the porter.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sir, we – ah – do need to hasten our steps, you are expected at five,’ Weston said awkwardly. I nodded and ran my hands through my hair as if to untangle my thoughts; it would not do to have my brains running on locks and keys while I was supposed to be disputing the laws of the cosmos in front of all Oxford.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes – I am sorry. Let us make haste – you lead the way,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They were saying you were right there this morning, sir, when Gabe Norris shot the dog. Did you see the whole thing?’</p>
<p class="indented">Weston spoke with a boyish excitement, looking at me eagerly as he showed the way into Brasenose Lane, a narrow alley running along the north side of the college. Here the ground was muddy underfoot and the alley smelled as if it were a favourite place to piss. I took a deep breath and followed him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was there, yes. But we were all too late – something for which I cannot forgive myself. Young Norris is a true shot – if we had been just a few moments earlier, poor Doctor Mercer might have stood a chance.’</p>
<p class="indented">Weston pursed his lips.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Aye, well – the likes of Gabe Norris have nothing else to do with their time except practise their sports. It won’t matter a jot to him whether he even takes his degree – Oxford is just one more amusement to his sort, strutting about in his London finery. Not so for we poor scholars obliged to go into the Church, alas.’ He laughed bitterly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You don’t like him, I deduce?’ I said, smiling.</p>
<p class="indented">Weston appeared to relent.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, he’s all right. I resent the commoners in principle – in a community of scholars one should feel oneself among equals, and their presence reinforces the notion of degree. And it is galling the way most of them don’t care for their studies at all. But Gabe Norris is not the worst – he is quite generous with his fortune really, and not as stupid as some. Do you know, he has his own horse, sir?’ Weston paused, shaking his head with a young man’s envy. ‘A roan gelding, the finest creature you ever saw. He stables it outside the city walls, for students are not supposed to keep their own mounts. But he does what he likes, for who would punish him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He does seem very sure of himself,’ I agreed. ‘I imagine he gets more than his fair share of women, too, with that face.’</p>
<p class="indented">Weston only turned his head to glance at me, a sly grin curling at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You might <em class="calibre2">imagine</em> so, aye,’ he said, and his peculiar emphasis, together with the mischievous smile, caught my attention.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah,’ I said, guessing at his meaning. ‘You mean to say that women are not Master Norris’s principal area of interest?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would speak no slander against him, sir. I have no idea what he does in private, it is only what is said.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Much may be said in envy,’ I observed as we walked. ‘Why is it said of him, do you know?’</p>
<p class="indented">Weston looked down, embarrassed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, for one, he does not like to visit the bawdy-houses, sir.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It does not follow that he is therefore a sodomite.’ Privately, though, it would not surprise me to learn that it was true of Norris, with his dandyish ways. I remembered the curious look he had given me when I mentioned St Bernardino’s tirade against sodomites. ‘And you should be careful with such gossip – sodomy is a hanging offence in this country, is it not?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, sir. You are right, of course.’ Weston looked chastened. ‘But we have all noticed it. If a beautiful girl makes eyes at you like a calf, while you show yourself so entirely indifferent, it cannot be that you have a man’s blood, would you not say, sir?’ His cheeks were flushed crimson, and I guessed from this outburst that he was speaking of matters close to home. Since there was only one female in the immediate orbit of the young scholars, it was not hard to fathom who he meant.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are talking of the rector’s daughter?’ It should not have surprised me; as the only young woman in the college, why should she not set her fancy at the handsomest of the rich young men there? Yet I felt somehow disappointed by the revelation, as if I had imagined a girl with Sophia’s quick mind would not be blinded by such superficial qualities. ‘She has confided in you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh no, sir – and I have said too much already.’</p>
<p class="indented">He tried to change the subject but at that moment I stopped abruptly, realising that we were now at the end of Brasenose Lane and the wall running to our right was the wall of Lincoln Grove. The thick wooden door set into the wall was firmly shut. This must have been where the dog was released into the garden.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wait a moment,’ I said, crouching down to examine the mud around the base of the door. It was undoubtedly churned up, but the passage of feet in the wet ground since the morning had obliterated any clear trace of prints and I cursed myself for not having had the wit to go and look for evidence straight away. I stood up and tried the handle to the door; it was locked. I was about to turn away when something caught my eye among the tufts of grass growing at the foot of the gate. I crouched again and drew out a thin leather strap, torn at one end – the kind of strap one might use for muzzling a dog. I did not know what use it might be, but I slipped it into my pocket just in case.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sir, we shall be late.’ Weston seemed agitated, but I had noticed him watching me with curiosity as I pocketed the strap. ‘Just at the end of the lane, and we are almost there.’</p>
<p class="indented">We passed into a wide square bordered by St Mary’s Church to the right and, just visible to the left, above the wall of Exeter College garden, the pinnacles of the Divinity School. Ahead I could see the bulk of the city wall, its crenellated battlements outlined against the sky. Rounding the corner, we were dwarfed by the spectacular façade of the Divinity School and I paused to admire it, craning my neck up to the turrets above the grand arched window. Usually only ecclesiastical buildings were designed in such splendour, but here was a secular edifice built like a cathedral, consecrated to the pursuit of knowledge, quite equal to the grand church of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples where I had first learned the art of disputation. To think that my ideas would join the echoes in its magnificent vaults was almost humbling, and I was about to make a remark to that effect to my guide, when I prickled with the discomfiting sense that I was being watched. I turned, and saw, leaning up against the blackened stone of the city wall, a tall man with folded arms, staring at me quite blatantly. He was dressed in an old leather jerkin and breeches of worn brown cloth, his hair was severely receded on top but long at the back, leaving his large forehead bare, and his face was pitted with the marks of pox; he might have been my own age or he might have been fifty, but the most striking aspect of his appearance was that he had no ears. Ugly welts of scar tissue surrounded the holes where they would once have been, betraying the fact that he had at one time been brought to justice as a petty criminal. He continued to watch me with a cool, level gaze in which I could discern no malice, rather a kind of mocking curiosity. I wondered if he was staring at me in particular, or if he were an opportunist pickpocket or some such, on the lookout for opportunity among the crowds gathering for the disputation. I had noted on my travels through Europe how petty thieves always seem to assume that men of education are necessarily also men of wealth; in my experience the two are rarely found together. If so, the man was bold; a further arrest for theft and he would risk the rope.</p>
<p class="indented">On another occasion I might have challenged his insolent stare, but there was no time to spare, so I turned towards the great porch of the Divinity School and was about to mount the stairs when I saw Doctor James Coverdale hurrying down them, pushing his way against the tide of young men in black gowns crowding to get in. He noticed me and stopped, a look of relief on his face; from the corner of my eye, I saw the figure in brown against the wall stir himself and take a step forwards. Coverdale also noticed; he froze for a moment and stared at the man with no ears, who looked directly at him and appeared to nod. It was clear that they recognised one another; Coverdale glared at him for a moment, his expression divided, it seemed to me, between irritation and concern, then he pasted on a smile for my benefit and guided me gently by the elbow to the right of the doorway, away from the man’s inquisitive gaze.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Weston, for delivering our guest safely – you may join your friends inside,’ Coverdale said pleasantly to my young guide, though his face had turned pale. Weston bowed to me before galloping up the steps and into the throng.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno, I wondered if I might have a brief word before we go in?’ Coverdale murmured. ‘Don’t worry, we have time – our royal visitor is not yet arrived and it cannot go ahead without him.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded; it would be typical of the palatine not to bother arriving on time on my account. I adopted an air of polite attention; Coverdale seemed uncomfortable with what he needed to say.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is to be an inquest into the death of poor Doctor Mercer, you understand, and those who were first to arrive on the scene will be required to give evidence,’ he began, his hand still clutching my elbow; I could not tell if this was supposed to be reassuring or menacing. ‘I understand you were there early, together with the rector and Master Norris.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, and I will gladly recount what I saw for the inquest, though I hope it will be before my party has to return to London,’ I said expectantly, for I was sure there was more to come.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is only that – ah …’ Here he faltered, and produced a little nervous laugh. ‘The rector mentioned that you believed the garden gate into Brasenose Lane was locked when you all found poor Roger.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I tried it and it was locked fast. As were both the other gates.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, when I heard that, it occurred to me that of course you are not familiar with our college, so you would not have known that the gate to the lane has a very stiff handle on the inside.’</p>
<p class="indented">I raised an eyebrow to indicate my scepticism.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes,’ he went on, not quite looking me in the eye, ‘it is very hard indeed to turn and requires a particular knack of twisting it to the right, just so. I only mention it because if you were to suggest at the inquest that the gate had been locked – well, you can see it would add all manner of complication to what is really a very simple and tragic explanation. The porter forgot to lock the gate, a feral stray got in, poor Roger paid the price for someone else’s carelessness. It is dreadful, quite dreadful –’ here he pressed his palm to his breast, his fat face worked up into a mask of sorrow – ‘but all this talk of locked gates will, I fear, create alarm of some conspiracy where none exists.’</p>
<p class="indented">I could not quite believe what I was hearing. I removed my arm from his grip and moved to face him; students were still pressing up the stairs around us and I lowered my voice accordingly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Coverdale, the gate was locked – I cannot be in any doubt about that fact. I tried it myself. And even if it were only closed, the dog did not close it after it strayed in.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The wind could have blown it shut,’ Coverdale said dismissively.</p>
<p class="indented">For a moment I was incredulous; did he really imagine I could so easily be persuaded to doubt the evidence of my own eyes?</p>
<p class="indented">‘A heavy wooden gate like that? I was <em class="calibre2">there</em>, Doctor Coverdale – I went through all the possibilities with the rector,’ I protested, <em class="calibre2">sotto voce</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The rector has had time now to reflect on this morning’s events with sober judgement,’ said Coverdale smoothly, ‘and he has concluded that in the mist and panic it was hard to discern anything for certain. It was he who remembered how stiff the handle can be from the inside, and how that might confuse a foreigner. Any coroner conducting an inquest would certainly take into account that you could not be expected to know your way around the college. I mention it because for you to insist that there is some mystery will only prolong and complicate a process which will already be most distressing to Doctor Mercer’s friends and colleagues. There is nothing to be gained by adding spurious fancies and suspicions to a tragic accident.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked at him for a moment. So they had decided to rewrite the circumstances of Mercer’s death in a way that would avoid any scandal to the college – and a murderer would go free. Were they protecting someone in particular, or was it for them simply a matter of collectively saving face? I wondered if the rector would keep to his promise to investigate the matter privately, but I doubted it; he was the most anxious of all about the college’s public standing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I feel that I must report to the inquest what I believe I saw this morning,’ I said. ‘If I was mistaken, you are right – I will look a fool, but I will have to take that chance. I would not sleep easily knowing I had not given all the evidence.’</p>
<p class="indented">Coverdale narrowed his eyes, then appeared to accept my statement.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Very well, Doctor Bruno, you must act according to your conscience. Shall we go in?’ He motioned to the steps up to the porch of the Divinity School, where the crowd had begun to thin to a trickle; most of the audience were now inside. ‘Oh, but – there is one rather curious thing,’ he added breezily over his shoulder as he climbed the first step. ‘Master Slythurst told me he was on his way up to the strongroom this morning when he heard noises from inside Doctor Mercer’s chamber – and when he looked in, he found the place turned upside down and who should be there, going through Mercer’s belongings, but our esteemed Italian guest? Trying to open his strongbox, no less. And the porter said you brought back a set of keys you had removed from the body.’</p>
<p class="indented">I cursed my stupidity in falling asleep that morning; I had forgotten to take the clothes to the rector with my poor excuse and now, as I feared, Slythurst had covered his own tracks by suggesting I was no more than a common thief. I noticed his version omitted the detail of his having a key to Mercer’s room.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is an explanation,’ I began, but Coverdale held up his hand to forestall me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, no doubt, Doctor Bruno, no doubt. But it might be that to a magistrate such behaviour would look extremely odd – not to say suspicious – and here among the townspeople there is such dislike of <em class="calibre2">foreigners</em>, you understand, especially of the <em class="calibre2">Romish</em> sort,’ he said, affecting an apologetic tone, ‘that judgement can often be clouded by blind prejudice. And if the inquest is made more complicated than it need be, these are just the kind of difficult details that might come to light.’</p>
<p class="indented">We were now on the threshold of the Divinity School; I glanced inside and saw that the auditorium was full and students were finding themselves places along the window-ledges and standing at the back. Coverdale was smiling expectantly up at me after delivering this direct threat. I studied his face for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I understand your meaning, Doctor Coverdale, and will certainly give some thought to the matter.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good man,’ Coverdale said agreeably. ‘I’m sure you will see the sense in it. Shall we go in?’</p>
<p class="indented">I paused at the doorway and glanced over my shoulder in the direction of the city wall; the man with no ears was still lounging there, still casually watching us. I touched Coverdale’s elbow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is that man?’ I gestured with my head in his direction.</p>
<p class="indented">Coverdale looked, blinked, then shook his head.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘No one of significance,’ he said abruptly, and held the door for me to pass through.</p>
<p class="flush-left">I tried to put this conversation from my mind as I prepared to speak; a great hush descended upon the hall, broken only by the usual shuffling, coughing and rustling of gowns from the audience. I cleared my throat, and leaned forward over my lectern to begin my address.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I, Giordano Bruno the Nolan, doctor of a more sophisticated theology, professor of a more pure and innocent wisdom, known to the best academies of Europe, a proven and honoured philosopher, a stranger only among barbarians and knaves, the awakener of sleeping spirits, the tamer of presumptuous and stubborn ignorance, who professes a general love of humanity in all his actions, who prefers as company neither Briton nor Italian, male nor female, bishop nor king, robe nor armour, friar nor layman, but only those whose conversation is more peaceable, more civil, more faithful, and more valuable, who respects not the anointed head, the signed forehead, the washed hands, or the circumcised penis, but rather the spirit and culture of mind which can be read in the face of a real person; whom the propagators of stupidity and the small-time hypocrites detest, whom the sober and studious love, and whom the most noble minds acclaim – to the most excellent and illustrious vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, many greetings.’</p>
<p class="indented">I bowed low towards the stage where the vice-chancellor sat, anticipating the volume of applause such an opening would invite in the European academies, and was taken aback when finally I realised that the susurration reaching my ears was that of mocking laughter. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Sidney; he grimaced and made a chopping motion across his throat as if to imply that my speech had been too much. I could not understand this; in Paris, a disputation was hardly considered worth the name unless the rhetoric reached absurd heights of grandiosity, but it seemed that in this, as in so much else, the English preferred to hide behind a plain and self-effacing style. I could hear them sniggering quite openly now – and I mean the Fellows, not the students, though they were beginning to pick up the cue from their elders; I heard a number of them mimicking my accent like schoolboys. Across the hall, Rector Underhill was leaning on his podium with a smile that suggested he was enjoying the spectacle; evidently he seemed to think he had already won. The palatine yawned loudly and ostentatiously.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I reject absolutely,’ I cried, banging a fist on the lectern and then raising my hand for emphasis as the laughter died away to a startled silence, ‘the notion that the stars are fixed on the tapestry of the heavens! The stars are no more nor differently fixed in the universe than this star the Sun, and the region of the Bear’s tail no more deserves to be called the Eighth Sphere than does that of the Earth, on which we live. Those with sufficient wisdom will recognise that the apparent motion of the universe derives from the rotation of the Earth, for there is much less reason why the Sun and the whole universe of innumerable stars should turn around this globe than it, on the contrary, should turn with respect to the universe. Let our reason no longer be fettered by the eight or nine imaginary spheres, for there is but one sky, immense and infinite, with infinite capacity for innumerable worlds similar to this one, rounding their orbits as the Earth rounds its own.’</p>
<p class="indented">I paused for breath, better pleased with this opening salvo, and Underhill took the opportunity to jump in.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you say so, sir?’ he countered, that self-satisfied smile playing at his lips. ‘It seems to me that, rather than the Sun standing still and the Earth running around it, it is your head which runs around and your brains which do not stand still!’</p>
<p class="indented">He turned to the audience of Fellows for congratulation and was not disappointed; a chorus of guffaws erupted and it was some moments before I could make myself heard in response.</p>
<p class="indented">The disputation, I am sorry to say, was not a success, and I will not trouble my reader with any more of its substance. It continued in much the same manner; Rector Underhill advanced nothing but the old, tired arguments in favour of Aristotle – claiming no more scientific proof than the weight of scholastic authority in placing the Earth at the fixed centre of the universe, as if authority has never been mistaken, and at one point suggesting that Copernicus had never meant his theory to be taken literally but had only developed it as a metaphor to aid mathematical calculation. All these arguments I had heard and rebutted many times before, in better society than this, but I was barely given the chance that afternoon, since Underhill’s main concern was not to persuade the audience by his own skill in debate (most of them were already squarely of his opinion and had not the courtesy even to listen to my arguments) but to ridicule me and expose me as often as possible to the mockery of his peers. This, it seemed, was their idea of entertainment, and the manners of the crowd were so poor that for the most part they chattered and commented throughout both our speeches. I was part way through an impassioned argument involving complex mathematical propositions when I was interrupted by an alarming noise that sounded like the low growl of a dog; overly sensitive to such sounds since the morning’s events, I started visibly and turned, only to discover it was in fact the palatine noisily snoring, but by then, the thread of my argument was badly frayed. A few moments later, we were disturbed by a great scuffle as an undergraduate pushed his way through the ranks of the seated Fellows to attract the attention of one of them; it turned out that he sought Doctor Coverdale who, apparently responding to a summons, immediately left his place in the middle of a row, apologising in a theatrical whisper to all those between him and the door who were obliged to rise in their seats to allow him through. I would not have expected Coverdale to show any restraint on my behalf, but I was surprised that he would behave with so little courtesy to his own rector as to leave in the middle of the debate.</p>
<p class="indented">We proceeded laboriously towards an ending that was nothing like a conclusion; I put forward my own complex calculations to account for the relative diameter of the Moon, the Earth and the Sun in terms even an idiot could understand, and in response Underhill merely repeated the old scholastic misconceptions common to all those who conflate science and theology and believe the Holy Scripture to be the last word in scientific enquiry. He also made frequent pointed references to my status as a foreigner, implying that it necessarily bestowed inferior intelligence, and more than once noted that Copernicus too was foreign and therefore could not be expected to display the robust reasoning of an Englishman – apparently forgetting that the whole occasion for this sorry pretence at debate was to honour Copernicus’s royal countryman. I was glad to be done with it; I bowed tersely to the smattering of insincere applause and climbed down from my pulpit feeling bruised and belittled.</p>
<p class="indented">Afterwards, as the hall cleared, none of the departing Fellows would meet my eye. I remained seated morosely beneath the window, thinking that I would wait for them all to leave so as to avoid any further mockery – or, worse, commiseration – when I saw Sidney fighting his way down from the dais. He pushed through to me, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘This evening I was ashamed of my university, Bruno,’ he exploded, two spots of crimson flaming with indignation on his cheeks. ‘Underhill is a weasel – he didn’t once engage with the substance of your argument! I call it shameful – it was a display of pure blind arrogance.’ He shook his head, his lips pressed together as if he were reprimanding himself. ‘It is our least attractive trait as a nation, this belief in our own superiority.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have been too fortunate in counting you and Walsingham among my acquaintance,’ I said, shaking my head. ‘I imagined all Englishmen to be as liberal-minded and curious about the world. I see I was badly mistaken.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Mind you,’ he said, philosophically, ‘you don’t help yourself, Bruno – what was that opening speech all about?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It served me well in Paris.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No doubt. But it’s not really how we do things here. We tend not to warm to those who sing their own praises too fulsomely – I think that was when you lost your audience. And perhaps leave out the circumcised penises next time.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will bear that in mind,’ I said stiffly. ‘Though I doubt there will be a next time.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It has not been much of a visit for you thus far, old friend, has it?’ he said, with an affectionate cuff on the shoulder. ‘First the company of that Polish oaf, then a man is brutally done to death outside your window, and now you suffer this indignity from fools who could not begin to comprehend your vision. I am sorry for it, truly. But perhaps from hereon we can concentrate on our real task,’ he added, dropping his voice. ‘In any case, we are all invited to dine at Christ Church tonight, so let us empty their wine cellars, forget all about this dreary business, and make a night of it – what do you say?’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked up at him, grateful for his efforts but thinking that his buoyant company was the last thing I wanted that evening.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Philip, but I fear I would not be much of an addition to the table this evening. Let me retire to lick my wounds and I promise by tomorrow I will be ready for any adventure you propose.’</p>
<p class="indented">He looked disappointed, but nodded in understanding.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will hold you to that. In fact, the palatine has a fancy for hunting or hawking in the Forest of Shotover if this rain breaks, and of course I must bend to his whim. But I do not think I can bear it if you are not one of the party.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will see how I feel. Why don’t you take your new friend Gabriel Norris?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, I did invite him, but he has another commitment tomorrow,’ Sidney said breezily, missing the barb in my tone. ‘Not that I’m too sorry – that young braggart is going home with half my purse. Remind me never to play cards with him again.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, I will join you if I feel rested,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">Norris had suggested the wolfhound could have strayed from Shotover Forest; I was no huntsman, but it would be a chance to see if there was some connection. Sidney shook my hand, gave me another resounding thump between the shoulder blades – the English way of displaying manly friendship – and left me to wander the short distance back to the college alone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Dio fulmini questi inglesi</em>!’ I burst out as I rounded the corner into Brasenose Lane, kicking in fury at a stone in my path. ‘<em class="calibre2">Si comportano come cani di strada</em> – no, they are worse than dogs! Was ever a race so arrogant, small-minded and self-congratulating as the men of this miserable island? They could no more contemplate new philosophies or science than they could imagine eating food with flavour! It must be the endless rain that has turned their brains to pulp. To sneer at a man, not for the meat of what he says but because he had the good fortune to be born beyond these dismal shores! And how dare they presume to laugh at my pronunciation – where in God’s name do they imagine the Latin tongue came from in the first place? <em class="calibre2">Asini pedanti</em>!’ I cursed freely in this vein, in Italian, all the way to Lincoln gatehouse until my anger was partly vented; it was fortunate that there were no passers-by to take fright.</p>
<p class="indented">It was with a heavy heart that I pushed open the main gate and stopped by the porter’s lodge to ask Cobbett if I might borrow a lantern for my chamber. The old porter was dozing gently in his chair, a pot of ale on the table, the dog resting her head on his knee. I coughed and he spluttered awake, brushing himself down.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, pardon me, Doctor Bruno, I didn’t hear you come in. I was deep in thought there.’ He winked and I mustered a smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good evening, Cobbett. Might I trouble you for a spare lantern?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course, sir.’ Cobbett heaved his great bulk effortfully upright and shuffled off towards one of the wooden cupboards that lined the walls. ‘You’re back early, sir, if I may remark – I thought there was to be a great entertainment at Christ Church tonight for the royal visitation?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was tired,’ I said, hoping to avoid any questions about the disputation.</p>
<p class="indented">Cobbett nodded in sympathy.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not surprised, all the goings-on this morning. Let’s hope we can all sleep sound in our beds tonight, eh? Funny,’ he remarked, opening the lantern’s glass casing to light the candle from his own, ‘Doctor Coverdale come back early tonight as well. In a great tearing hurry, he was. I saw him rushing through the gate there and I said to myself, they must have finished proceedings in a rare haste tonight. Generally there’s no stopping them at these debates once they get a taste for the sound of their own voice – with the greatest of respect, sir. But then as no one else followed, I concluded he must have had business of his own.’ He finished with a throaty chuckle.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I fear Doctor Coverdale had more important matters to attend to than my poor speech,’ I said, unable to disguise the resentment in my voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, I hope God sends you good rest tonight, sir,’ Cobbett said, handing me the lantern, its flame jerking with the motion. ‘I suppose you will be staying with us until the enquiry now? You will be feeling quite at home here before long.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sure I will,’ I replied flatly, and bade Cobbett a good night, realising the import of his words. How long would I be detained here? I wondered, and would I be obliged by law to stay behind and testify even if Sidney and the palatine left on the appointed day?</p>
<p class="indented">All around the small quadrangle the umber light of candles burned in various windows, giving out a friendly glow, but I could not shake the sense of unease that had followed me from London. Something cruel was at work here, and I had a horrible intimation that it was not yet over. As I paused to look around me at the blank windows, I prickled with the sense of being watched.</p>
<p class="indented">My staircase was silent and so dark that without Cobbett’s lantern I would have had to feel my way as a blind man; so dark that I would have missed the paper that had been slipped under my door, had I not stepped on it and heard an unexpected rustle as I entered the room. I bent to retrieve it; one leaf, folded neatly in half, and when I opened it another, smaller slip of paper no wider than a ribbon fluttered out and fell to the floor. By the dim light of the lantern, I made out a series of concentric circles on the larger sheet of paper; intrigued, I impatiently set about lighting the candles in the sconces around the room to give me more light by which to examine this strange missive. Once I could see it clearly, my puzzlement only grew: the substance of the diagram was clear enough, but not its meaning. For this was unmistakeably a drawing of the Copernican universe, made by a skilled hand, with the seven planets tracing their orbits around the Sun; at least, so it seemed at first, but there, in the centre, where the figure of Sol should have been, was a representation not of the Sun but of a small circle with spokes, the exact symbol I had found dotted through Roger Mercer’s almanac.</p>
<p class="indented">Utterly perplexed, I reached for the second slip of paper, which had almost become lost between the floorboards, and saw that there was writing printed on it; on closer inspection, it was clear that it had been very neatly cut from a book, and the sentence that had been so carefully excised made me gasp aloud:</p>
<p class="indented"><em class="calibre2">I am the wheate or grayne of Christ, I shall be grounde with the teethe of wilde beastes, that I may be found pure bread.</em></p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter005" class="calibre4">FIVE</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Muffled by fog and distance, the church bells of Saint-Victor tolled the passing hours, summoning the friars to observe the holy offices first of Vespers, then of Compline. The temperature dropped as darkness enfolded the abbey; in my coffin-like space behind the crates, my limbs grew so chilled I felt I was being paralysed from the inside out, my feet so frozen that hot currents of pain began to needle through them and up my legs. My back developed a fierce, dull ache; from time to time I dared slide out and stretch or stamp to restore some blood to my extremities. Despite the discomfort, I must have dozed, waking with a start each time I began to tilt sideways, wrenched from monstrous dreams of being buried alive. I wished I had asked Cotin to leave his lantern; I could have passed the hours looking through the boxes of forgotten manuscripts. But that was folly; I would not have had time to conceal myself if the door opened, and the smell of candle smoke would give me away. Instead I remained hidden in the darkness, listening to the squeaks and pattering of rats and the slow creak of old timbers, reviewing what I thought I knew.</p>
<p class="indented">Paul Lefèvre had intimated to me during our conversation in the confessional that he believed the King would not hold power for much longer. Though he had quickly tried to deny that he meant anything specific, it seemed likely that he had some concrete intelligence of a planned coup by the Duke of Guise and the Catholic League. But a priest like Paul would be small fry to Guise; useful while he could be persuaded to attack King Henri from his pulpit, but hardly someone to whom Guise would have confided plans for an act of treason. So Paul must have come by that knowledge another way; the burned scraps of letter in his hearth suggested that he had heard something in the course of a confession that had disturbed him so greatly he had considered breaking the holy seal of the confessional in order to warn the King. Some terrible harm planned by someone or something known as ‘Circe’. Whatever he had learned had troubled him so much that it had been the last thought to pass from his shattered brain to his lips as the life bled out of him. But here my theory foundered on a lack of certainty. There was no way of knowing whether Paul had sent a copy of that letter to the King, or whether he had changed his mind but someone had still felt he needed to be silenced.</p>
<p class="indented">The nature of the letter also puzzled me. Paul was a zealous supporter of the Catholic League; you would suppose that he would support any plot to topple the degenerate King and replace him with a righteous Catholic. What could be so terrible about the harm intended by ‘Circe’ that it could have induced the fervent Paul to consider betraying not only the sacrament of confession but his loyalty to the entire cause of the League? And who could have confessed such a conspiracy to him? I did not have the answers to these questions. I could only guess that, somehow, the Duke of Guise had anticipated betrayal and taken measures that he hoped would prevent it. But if so, that meant he must also know about the confession; presumably that person too would have to be silenced. Perhaps the killer would be able to shed more light on the plot once he was in the custody of the royal guard.</p>
<p class="indented">I was jolted from my theorising by the sound of a key in the lock. Wedged tight into the recess, I leaned across to make sure I could see through the narrow gap between the two stacks of boxes. Ignoring the pain in all my joints, I held myself still, terrified that the slightest sound would give me away and ruin my advantage. Despite what I had promised Cotin, I had no intention of allowing the killer to leave and hide his evidence. I was confident that, with surprise on my side and the help of a weapon, I could easily overcome him and force him at knifepoint to the gate, where the King’s soldiers would be waiting.</p>
<p class="indented">The door creaked open and a faint circle of light appeared; behind it, the outline of a figure, the cowl of his habit pulled up over his head. I heard the door click shut and the light brightened; I realised he had draped the lantern with a cloth to dim it on his way through the grounds. I held my breath, every fibre tensed. He crossed immediately to the boxes of books, set down his light and crouched to pull away the first crate. Silently, I eased out from my hiding place and drew my knife. The light from his lantern puddled on the floor; I caught a glimpse of his profile as he straightened, clasping the bundle with the statue to his breast with both hands like a Madonna holding an infant. I stepped forward; the movement startled him and he whipped around to face me, frozen with surprise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Keep quiet, don’t move, and you won’t come to harm,’ I said, holding the point of the knife towards him. ‘I need you to come with me. Bring that with you.’</p>
<p class="indented">His face was still hidden in shadow, but I saw his eyes flick down to the statue, as if he had forgotten he was holding it. In an instant he seemed to recover his power of thought; he leaned back and, with considerable force, hurled the statue at me so that it struck me in the chin. I staggered backwards, touching my fingertips to my face, and in that unguarded moment he swung a punch that connected with the left side of my jaw. I dropped the knife; my mouth filled with blood as I struggled to recover my balance, but he reached out and pulled at the stack of crates beside us so that it toppled forwards. I managed to jump back as boxes of stone, glass and metal crashed across the floor, trapping me in the corner. I was fortunate that no flying debris struck me, but by the time I had clambered over the heap, he had already grabbed the lantern and plunged me into darkness as he closed the door behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">Cursing, I stumbled blindly across the room, spitting blood, relieved to find that he had not locked me in. Outside the mist was so thick now that I could not see more than four or five feet in front of me, but the lantern was just visible as a pinprick of fuzzy light between the bent shapes of trees ahead. I lurched after it, tripping on clumps of grass, branches clawing at my clothes, damp skeins of cobweb clinging to my face as trunks loomed out of nowhere and the light bobbed and grew fainter. Moonlight barely silvered the layers of vapour that hung heavy as smoke in the air. After a few paces I could no longer see the lantern at all. I thought I heard a low laugh from just behind my left shoulder, though it might as easily have been a magpie. I realised he had led me into the orchard deliberately to confuse me. There was no sound now but the stillness of the night and my own blood thudding in my chest. Turning again to what I believed was the direction of the path, I moved with caution, but before I found the edge of the trees I glimpsed the light again, jouncing up and down a few yards ahead. I ran towards it, only to see it disappear as I heard the sound of a gate slamming and the key turning in the lock.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre6">Merda</em>,’ I muttered. A few feet further on I found the path leading to the door in the wall; my quarry had slipped out while I was stumbling among the trees. I hesitated, trying to decide my best course. I had Cotin’s key; I could pursue him, but he might have hidden himself along the river track with the idea of ambushing me if I followed. He had already shown himself unafraid to kill a man on that path; I did not want to go the same way, and I was unarmed now. Besides, I thought, brightening – if all had gone smoothly, he would have run straight into the arms of the King’s soldiers. I hoped they would have the wit to hold him until I caught up with them. But there was still the matter of evidence; while he was away from the abbey, this was my chance to see if there was anything more than the cloak and statue that would serve to condemn him beyond doubt. Perhaps he had kept some correspondence hidden in his cell that would make explicit who had set him on to kill Paul – any such letter would be a thousand times more valuable than a bloodied statue. It was worth a try. I ran my fingers gingerly over my swollen lip; though I had still not had a clear view of his face, I could be fairly sure that punch was not thrown by a man with a crippled right hand. If Cotin was right, there was only one other friar with a key to the storeroom. At least that meant I had an idea of where to start.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned my steps away from the gate and followed the path back to the outbuilding. Feeling along the shelf behind the door where Cotin had found the lantern, my fingers closed over a stub of candle. I drew my tinder-box from the pouch at my belt and fumbled with frozen and trembling fingers to strike a spark from it. The room was a chaos of broken stone, metal and glass, strewn over the floor where he had pulled the crates down to slow me. Scrabbling one-handed while I tried to hold up the feeble light, I found my knife, then unearthed the statue, still tangled in its cloak, and bundled it under my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">The damp air snuffed my candle as soon as I stepped outside. After a couple of attempts to relight it I was forced to concede that I did not have the time to lose; I would have to rely on my sense of direction. If the King’s guards had not stopped my attacker, there was always the chance that he would run around the perimeter of the abbey wall and try to enter another way, but the main gate would be barred at this hour and surely he would not want to wake the gatekeeper and explain himself. My guess was that he would wait and return eventually through the back wall in search of the statue. I had no idea what time it might be by now, but I must not be found sneaking around the abbey when the friars were awakened for the office of Matins at two o’clock. I could not afford to end up wandering lost in the mist. From the storehouse I set out through the trees away from the wall that separated the abbey grounds from the river path and tried to steer myself in a straight line. As a novice, I had been taught to recite certain Psalms as a means of measuring time without the need for clocks or church bells, and though I no longer spoke them in worship, I still had them all by rote, and they proved useful when I needed to mark the passing time. So it was that, after around ten minutes of determined walking, one step after another, into the white blankness, I saw the bulk of the abbey church against the sky a hundred yards ahead. Relieved, I quickened my steps towards it and the cloisters that lay beyond; in my haste I collided with a tall figure who reared up out of the mist, arms outstretched over me. I stifled a cry and jumped back, dropping the statue and grabbing for my knife as my heart hammered at my ribs, but my assailant did not move. After a moment, my shoulders slackened and I let out a panicked laugh at my own folly. I had run into a stone angel, wings spread, empty eyes raised to heaven. Taking another step back I almost fell over an object at knee height; I turned to find a moss-covered cross and realised I had wandered into the abbey cemetery. Picking my way through the graves, I found a path that I could follow as far as the church. There had been plenty among my brothers at San Domenico who would have been gibbering prayers to the Virgin and all the saints had they found themselves alone in a mist-shrouded graveyard at this hour, but I had never shared that monkish fear of the unquiet dead. It was only the living who would creep up on silent feet and put a blade in your neck.</p>
<p class="indented">There was no trace of light from the windows of the library, but the door was unlocked, so I slipped in as quietly as I could and lit my candle. Shadows leapt back and I felt a pulse of affection at the sight that greeted me; Cotin had fallen asleep at his desk with his head on an open book, resting on the crook of his arm, his lamp burned down beside him. I crouched and shook him by the shoulder.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wha—?’ He jerked awake, turning unfocused eyes on me. I motioned for him to be quiet.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where’s Albaric’s cell?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Eh? Dear Lord, what happened to your face?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not important. I need to look in Albaric’s cell. You have to show me which one it is.’</p>
<p class="indented">He levered himself up, wincing at the complaints of his joints. ‘I had hoped not to see you again tonight.’ He eased his neck from side to side.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My apologies. We need to hurry.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, what hour is it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No idea. But he could return any moment.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is him, then? You are sure?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No. But it seems the most likely possibility. He had a key and there was nothing wrong with his hand.’ I ran my tongue along my swollen lip and tasted blood. ‘That’s why I want to see his cell.’</p>
<p class="indented">Cotin eyed the statue under my arm, muttered a half-hearted protest and motioned for me to follow. At the door, he blew out my candle, in case the light gave us away to the night watch, and we both pulled our hoods around our faces. Keeping to the shadows against the walls, he led me around the arcades of the cloister and into the courtyard behind. The friars’ dormitory, directly ahead, was a long building of unadorned stone with rows of individual cells on two storeys facing one another across a wide corridor. I followed him up the first flight of stairs to the upper level. From the recess of the staircase, he pointed to the left-hand row of doors and held up four fingers. My eyes had begun to grow accustomed to the dark; I handed him the statue and left him hidden on the stairs while I crept along until I came to the fourth door. I glanced about me to either side before putting my hand to the latch. The atmosphere was oddly silent here, not even the usual snores or grunts you might expect from a house of sleeping men. It was as if every friar were holding his breath in anticipation. All the doors I could see appeared to be closed fast, but in my experience that did not necessarily mean no one was looking.</p>
<p class="indented">I let myself into Albaric’s room without a sound, keeping my hood up, and struck my tinder-box until the damp candle caught flame. By its light I saw a plain table against the wall by the door, with a large leather-bound book lying on it. That would be a place to start, at least; letters might be hidden between pages or inside bindings. I picked up the book, trying to hold the candle steady, but the volume was too large to lift with one hand, and as I was shaking it by the spine it slipped from my grasp and landed with a loud slap on the table. I froze, every muscle taut and trembling, eyes fixed on the door as I waited to see if the noise had disturbed anyone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What in Jesu’s name—?’ said a voice behind me.</p>
<p class="indented">I whirled around with a gasp, to see Frère Albaric sitting up on the mattress against the far wall, tangled in a woollen blanket. He stared at me, equally amazed, his eyes dazed and puffy with sleep. His hair stood up in tufts around his tonsure; one cheek was marked with a crease from his sheet and I could see that he was wearing a linen nightshift. His face bore the naked vulnerability that comes from being jolted out of deep sleep. I had been so convinced that he must have been the man in the storeroom I had no more than glanced at the bed to register a heap of blankets. I recovered my presence of mind before he did and blew out the candle as I slipped back into the corridor, hoping he had not had a chance to see my face.</p>
<p class="indented">A hand shot out from the darkness and grabbed my arm as I emerged; I jumped again, but it was Cotin, pressed up against the wall.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Frère Joseph is not in his cell,’ he whispered, pulling me by the sleeve and pointing me to a door on the opposite side, towards the far end. I scuttled along, hoping that Albaric would conclude he had imagined a figure from his nightmares and fall back to sleep without feeling the need to raise an alarm.</p>
<p class="indented">I eased the door of Joseph’s cell shut behind me and leaned against it, trying to slow my breathing. When I had managed to light the candle again, I saw that the almoner’s room was laid out much as Albaric’s, though the few furnishings were more obviously expensive: a mattress on a wooden pallet under a small arched window, set high in the wall opposite the door; on the right-hand side, a table and on the left, a wooden trunk. At least this time the bed was empty; from the tumbled sheets it looked as if Joseph had left in a hurry. The table was also bare, save for a branched silver candlestick, but to my relief, the chest was not padlocked. I opened the lid and began to pull out whatever I could find: good quality linen undershirts; a pair of leather shoes; a rosary of amber beads, smooth as glass; a tortoiseshell comb … but nothing more. Not in a trunk open to anyone; I should have realised. I cast around to see where else he might have hidden personal effects. The room held no other furniture, no cupboards, no drawers. Where had I squirrelled away the writings I wanted to keep from prying eyes when I was a friar? My eyes lighted on the mattress.</p>
<p class="indented">I fixed my candle into the silver holder on the table and set it down by the bed so that I could grope along the underside of the mattress until I felt a split in the seam, just large enough to slip a hand inside; through the lumps of horsehair my scrabbling fingers closed around a sheaf of papers. I drew them out and untied the ribbon binding them as I brought them closer to the light. The topmost sheet was instantly recognisable; another crude sketch of King Henri mincing in women’s clothes while two sly-looking young men with lascivious pouts wrapped their fists around the sceptre he held erect in his lap, above a set of satirical verses about the Queen Mother’s desperate recourse to witchcraft to secure a Valois heir. The paper beneath was more unusual: it showed a series of drawings depicting a variety of imaginative forms of torture and execution, while a queen looked on, the name ‘Elizabeth’ emblazoned above her head. The text was an impassioned plea, shorn of all ribald jokes, urging the people of France to consider the plight of their fellow Catholics in England, and to rise up and exterminate heresy before they too suffered the same fate at the hands of the Protestants. The writer ended his polemic by calling on true Catholics to finish the work begun on the glorious night of Saint Bartholomew’s – an extraordinary exhortation for which he would certainly be executed, if his authorship could be proved. The style – and I could almost swear the handwriting – were identical to the ones I had found in Paul’s room. That, at least, was evidence of a connection between Frère Joseph and the murdered priest.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">But there was another paper beneath, of better quality and written in a different hand. As I read, I felt my eyes widen.</p>
<p class="letter-space-after"><em class="calibre6">Your fingerprints your mouth your tongue burn my skin long after you are gone. Only you know the secret places of my body, the way I ache for you, in the knowledge I should not. Yet for all the judgement and scorn arrayed against us, for all the punishment that might befall us if it were known, I would not have given up one single hour in your embrace. You consume me. My desire wills me to you like a hawk towards home.</em></p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Followed by more in this vein, though it was neither signed nor dated; hot words for a friar who had taken a vow of celibacy. Joseph was running a great risk in keeping such an inflammatory letter, but perhaps his high birth gave him immunity from routine searches. I held the paper up to my face and sniffed it; faint traces of perfume lingered behind the smell of stale horsehair. The writing was distinctive, the letters embellished with elaborate flourishes; an educated hand, but belonging to someone with a taste for ostentation. I decided to keep the note; Joseph de Chartres may be well connected, but proof of a forbidden love affair might make him vulnerable. I was not sure how much could be achieved without a signature to the letter, or any means of identifying his correspondent, but it would surely make him nervous to suspect that someone else had it in their possession, and that might give me leverage.</p>
<p class="indented">I tucked the papers carefully into the secret pocket sewn into the lining of my doublet – an alteration I had had made to all my clothes when I lived in London, for just such a purpose. Reaching again into the mattress to check I had not missed anything, I rummaged around until my fingertips touched another object; this time a leather purse, tied with a drawstring. I opened it and tipped the contents into my palm: two gold écus and a torn strip of paper, on which was scribbled, in the same hand as the pamphlets, <em class="calibre6">Brinkley</em>,<em class="calibre6"> 28 11 4h.</em></p>
<p class="indented">Was it a code? Who or what was Brinkley? It was an English name, if I was not mistaken. Many of the émigrés who had fled to Paris rather than renounce their faith under Elizabeth had established connections with the Catholic League; if Joseph de Chartres was involved in distributing propaganda against the King, he might also be collaborating with the English Catholics – the anti-Elizabeth pamphlet among his papers suggested as much. Or perhaps Brinkley was a reference to the mistress, and the money was for her. As I stared at them, it struck me that perhaps it was not a cipher at all, but a far more obvious explanation – 4h could mean simply a time, <em class="calibre6">quatre heures</em>, in which case the other numbers might be the date. The 28th of November was tomorrow. A rendezvous, then? Even if my guess were correct, I had no way of knowing where or with whom, but at least it was one more thin thread I could follow, now that I was certain that Joseph must be Paul Lefèvre’s killer. I touched a thumb to my bruised mouth. Evidently he had exaggerated the limitations of his crippled hand.</p>
<p class="indented">I was crouching to return the money to its hiding place when the cell door juddered open and light flooded the walls. I whipped around, startled; a figure filled the doorway, lamp held aloft. He appeared to be fully dressed, despite the hour.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Put down the weapon,’ he said, in a voice accustomed to giving orders.</p>
<p class="indented">I stood and held out my hands, palms up, to show I was not armed. He eyed the purse.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The one at your belt,’ he said, with a touch more steel. He was a solid man, tall and broad, nearing sixty but still possessed of a vigorous energy apparent in his florid cheeks and quick, sharp eyes under bristling brows. His abbot’s robes were trimmed with fox-fur and patterned in gold thread that winked in the light; a jewelled crucifix hung from his neck, so large it almost reached his belt and would have made a lesser man stoop. ‘Let us see, now,’ he continued, as I unstrapped my knife and dropped it to the floor, ‘carrying a weapon inside the abbey precincts – that is an offence in itself. Unlawful intrusion, theft, violent assault—’ he gestured to the blood on my lip. ‘Quite a list of charges to be going on with.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was I who was assaulted,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">He raised an eyebrow. I realised I would do better to affect a degree of humility.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Father Abbot – I can see how this must look. But I can explain. If you send someone to look outside the gate, you will find soldiers from the King’s personal guard who will vouch for me. My name is—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know exactly who you are, Doctor Bruno,’ the Abbé said. His look suggested this knowledge was not going to work in my favour. ‘As for the soldiers – there <em class="calibre6">are</em> armed guards here, but not, I fear, the ones you requested in this letter.’ He flicked his wrist up to show a piece of paper held between his first and second finger. My heart dropped to my stomach. ‘Do you imagine I allow messages in and out of this abbey without knowing what they contain? Especially ones addressed to the Louvre. Cotin should have known better. But perhaps he stood to gain as your accomplice.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Father Abbot, you must listen. I believe you have a murderer in your abbey.’ I looked him in the eye and spoke solemnly. If I betrayed a hint of alarm, I would be giving him the confirmation he wanted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have a <em class="calibre6">thief</em> in my abbey, that much seems beyond doubt.’ He sniffed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am not a thief, Your Grace, I swear.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is your money, is it?’</p>
<p class="indented">We both looked at the purse in my hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I pray you, send to—’ I hesitated. Not the King. Cotin was right – Henri would not risk inflaming further ill feeling among the religious orders by coming to the defence of a heretic accused of theft in defiance of a powerful abbot. As I had already worked out, he had chosen me precisely because he could dissociate himself from me if things became awkward. But I still had one friend with a degree of influence. ‘Jacopo Corbinelli, at the palace. You must know him – he is secretary to the Queen Mother and the King’s librarian. He will vouch for me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No doubt. You Italians always stick together. Though he would be a fool to soil his hands in this instance. And in any case, I am not your messenger boy.’ He crushed the letter Cotin had written for me in his fist and turned in the doorway, motioning to someone out of sight. Still believing I might negotiate my way out of the situation, I dropped the purse on the bed and picked up the candle. Without thinking, I bent to retrieve my knife – it was valuable and I did not want to leave it behind if I was to be escorted out under guard. But the Abbé glanced back as I was reaching for it and cried out with as much drama as if I had stuck the blade in his ribs. Before I could surrender the weapon, he had retreated and two men armed with pikestaffs barged into the room; one seized me by the hair while the other twisted my arm behind my back and wrenched the knife from my grasp. In the commotion I let go of my candle, which caught the edge of Joseph’s bedding; a small conflagration erupted and the man holding my arm yelped and let go, flapping his hands at his leg where the flames had singed his hose. I took advantage of the confusion to tear myself away from the other one, leaving a clump of my hair in his fist. I hurled myself towards the door and out into the corridor; by now most of the cell doors stood open and a row of pale, awed faces stared at me.</p>
<p class="indented">The Abbé stood blocking my way to the stairs; there was no sign of Cotin and I could only hope he had had the sense to vanish with the statue before anyone had seen him.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘Stop that man!’ the Abbé thundered. I glanced back, in time to see the arc of a pikestaff descending, a moment before I felt the impact of the blow and my knees buckled beneath me. I tried to speak but no sound emerged; my sight blurred as the soldier crouched over me and the world turned black.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">It remained dark when I opened my eyes some time later, to find I was lying on my side, face pressed to the ground. My senses were still dulled from the blow to my head, though not sufficiently to block out the fierce smell of excrement that assailed my nostrils as soon as I was conscious. Where was I? I raised my head an inch as pain seared up the back of my skull like a hot needle. Under my cheek, the prickling of dried straw. A stable, perhaps? But it was not the clean, grassy smell of horse dung making me retch; this stink was human. Mine? I could hardly tell. When I tried to roll over, I found I could not move my arms; my wrists had been bound together behind me. I struggled to my knees and twisted my right shoulder up to try and wipe the dirt, or caked blood, from my eyes on my sleeve, but it made no difference to the darkness. There was no source of light in the room. I was frozen through, shivering so hard that my teeth clattered together and I was in danger of biting my tongue. I slumped back on to my heels, rolled my shoulders to ease the pain and tried to join the jolted fragments of memory. I had drifted in and out of consciousness after I was struck; they had put me on a horse, or had I imagined that? With a hood over my head, so I had no idea where they had taken me. I forced myself to my feet, feeling the world tilt and sway unnervingly as if I were at sea. I could at least stand upright. Despite the filthy air, I breathed slowly and deliberately, in and out. The pain in my head advanced and receded, making my eyes swim. When I was reasonably certain that I was not about to faint or vomit, I called out.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is anyone there? Hey!’</p>
<p class="indented">From somewhere behind me came an answering moan that sounded as if it had been loosed by one of Dante’s lost souls. I let out a cry, startled to find I was not alone. Dear God, what was this – a dungeon? The darkness was so thick you could almost feel it sliding across your face. I staggered forward, step by halting step, until finally I collided with a wall, slimy to the touch. Facing away, I groped along the stones with my bound hands as far as I could, until I met a corner. I followed that wall too, battling my rising fear that there was no door here, no way out. I stood still and shouted again for help, stamping my feet on the stone floor, though this produced no effect at all. The formless lament from the depths of the room grew louder and more agitated the more I yelled for someone to come, until the pitch of it made the wound on my head throb as if it would burst open—</p>
<p class="indented">‘For the love of Christ, will you stop that? I’m trying to make myself heard here.’</p>
<p class="indented">The tortured noise broke off abruptly. I peered into the darkness but could make out nothing. In the silence I heard a shuffling in the straw and a soft trickle of water, which could have been the damp running down the walls or my companion relieving himself. I put the thought from my mind and resumed my shouting.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They won’t come.’ The voice from the corner scraped like a rusted hinge, as if it had not been used in years.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where are we?’ I cast around in the dark, desperate. ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p class="indented">There was a rasping sound, a cough or possibly laughter, followed by the wet spatter of a gob of phlegm ejected on to the wall or floor. ‘I don’t remember.’ A pause. ‘That’s why we’re here. They forget you, then you forget yourself.’ More hacking, as if he were amused by his own joke.</p>
<p class="indented">Forget yourself. <em class="calibre6">Dio mio</em> … ‘An oubliette? Is that where we are?’ The deepest pit of any prison, underground, where they throw those who will never see the sky again. Those best forgotten, as my unseen companion pointed out. Panic surged through my veins; I resumed my stamping and shouting with renewed urgency, fighting the insistent voice in my head telling me it was likely that no one who could help me knew I was here. My fellow prisoner took up his wordless keening again, softly this time, as if exhausted by his own grief. After another prolonged bout of yelling until my throat was raw with the effort, I began to understand why his voice sounded so broken. Presumably he, too, had screamed himself hoarse at first in the belief that someone would respond. I stopped to gather my breath, and was rewarded by the sound of a metal bolt rattling overhead.</p>
<p class="indented">A hatch swung open above me and a greasy yellow light swept around the walls, revealing a low-ceilinged, windowless pit. I squinted, turning my face away; though it was only one candle in a lantern, the glow was still shockingly bright after the long spell in darkness. Once my eyes had adjusted, I was able to peer upwards to see the lower half of a face, veiled in shadow, looming through the opening.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You listen. I’m only here to tell you that if you keep up that fucking noise, I will come back and shut your mouth for you.’ I could make out stumps of teeth and a prominent growth on the man’s stubbled cheek. ‘Understood?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wait,’ I managed to stammer, ‘there’s been a mistake. I shouldn’t be here.’</p>
<p class="indented">The gaoler cackled. ‘That’s right, friend. You and all the others. Never met one yet that thought he should.’ He withdrew, and the light with him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Please! I need to send a message to my friend. I will pay you handsomely if you help me.’ I lurched a step closer to the opening. The man leaned down, cocking his head as if he were considering the offer. His expression suggested he doubted my ability to deliver on this promise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Tricky. See, someone’s already paid me to keep you in here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will pay you more.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wouldn’t be so much use to me without a head, though.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That won’t happen. Please – just send a message to the Louvre, that’s all I ask.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, is that all?’ In the light from the lantern his face contorted into a grotesque grin. ‘Friend of the King, are you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In fact, yes. Only let me prove it.’</p>
<p class="indented">He let out another bark of laughter. ‘You’ll be right at home here, then. Among the nobility. You all right, Monsieur le Comte?’ He lowered the light through the hole and I turned to see the creature in the corner raise his head with a frightened whimper. I could not suppress a gasp; my fellow prisoner was hardly recognisable as a man. He was so emaciated that he seemed little more than a corpse. Blistered yellow skin stretched tight over his skull; wisps of long grey hair cobwebbed over a face that would have been hideous, had it not been so pitiful. The man tilted his nose up like a mole, sniffing the air, and I could see that his eye sockets were empty, the rims livid with scar tissue. He was almost naked, save for a few scraps of rag, the remnants of clothes that had rotted away. Unlike me, he was not restrained with ropes or manacles; perhaps he was so destroyed there was no need.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not pretty, is he?’ the gaoler remarked, with a cough. ‘Best you’re in the dark, so you don’t have to see him. Stay here long enough, you’ll look like that too.’ He backed away from the hatch, still laughing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No – please!’ I cried, feverish with desperation. ‘Send a message to the palace for me – I beg you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Tell you what – I’ll put a word in next time I’m taking dinner with the King. In the meantime, you keep quiet and I might throw you something to eat later if you behave.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, wait—’</p>
<p class="indented">But the flickering circle of light vanished and the wooden cover dropped back into place with terrible finality; his laughter was still audible as the bolt was shot into place. I called a few more times, but it was evident that he was not coming back. It was only now that I realised how painfully hungry and thirsty I felt; I was torn between the need to try and negotiate with him, and the fear of jeopardising my prospects of food. And possibly those of my companion, I thought, and I could not risk that; he looked as if one more day without eating might be the end of him – although perhaps that would be a kindness. I crawled across the straw in the direction of the poor wretch in the corner, making reassuring noises to disguise my own fear. I could hear him moving away from me as I approached.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Don’t be afraid,’ I whispered. ‘Listen. Your hands are free. Can you untie me?’</p>
<p class="indented">His only response was a choked sob. Curbing my impatience, I tried again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I won’t hurt you. Will you help me? Please. I can’t think clearly with this pain in my arms.’ I shuffled closer on my knees until I heard his ragged breathing beside me. The stink coming off him made me retch; not just of his own filth, but the rotting odour of infected flesh from the sores and lacerations I had seen all over his body. It was a wonder the man was still alive. I turned my back and lifted my bound hands until my fingers made contact with him. I waited, breathing through my mouth – though that made little difference. After a long moment, a bony hand clasped my wrist. I gritted my teeth; those who fear the dead walk out of their graves to visit the living on All Hallows’ Eve must imagine just such a touch as this. But with surprising gentleness, those claw-like fingers began to pick at the knot on the cord holding me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Are you really a count?’ I asked, as he worked. For a while he didn’t answer. I could tell the task was costing him considerable effort; it must have been painful to bend his fingers.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I had that name once,’ he croaked, when I no longer expected a response. ‘Now I am no one.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why are you here?’ I was determined to keep up a conversation, though he seemed to find speech difficult. But only this meagre human contact could keep me from despair, I knew, though it was probably too late for him.</p>
<p class="indented">Another long silence elapsed; I could not tell if he was ignoring me or merely concentrating.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Saint Bartholemew’s,’ he whispered, at last, and his voice cracked as he spoke. At the same time, I felt the rope slacken slightly around my wrists. I tried to pull them apart; he laid his hand on my arm. ‘Patience,’ he murmured, and resumed his plucking at the knot.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Saint Bartholomew’s night? You are here because of the massacre?’ I flinched, despite myself.</p>
<p class="indented">He remained silent as he eased the rope away from my hands and rubbed at the raw patches on my wrists where the bindings had broken the skin. Gingerly, I raised one arm and touched the back of my head; there was a tender lump where I had been struck, and my hair was crusted with dried blood, but the wound was no longer bleeding. The massacre of Saint Bartholomew’s happened thirteen years ago. Had he been here all this time? My mind baulked at the thought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They came for the wedding,’ he said eventually, in a distant voice. ‘From the south. All Huguenots, you see. They were guests in my house.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘My cousin. His wife. The little girls. They had new gowns for it.’ His voice faltered and his breath hiccupped again. If he had had eyes, they would have been shedding tears. I reached out and through the dark I found his hand. Swallowing down my revulsion, I let him fold those dreadful skeletal fingers around mine and gradually his distress appeared to subside.</p>
<p class="indented">No one in France could fail to shiver at the mention of Saint Bartholomew’s night. The twenty-third of August, 1572, when Catholic mobs rampaged through the city, putting every Protestant they could find to the sword. The Seine ran crimson with blood for days after. Catherine de Medici had tried to force an end to the wars of religion by marrying her wild and beautiful daughter Margot to the leader of the Huguenots, the Protestant Henri of Navarre. The marriage was not approved by the Pope, and many devout Catholics were furious at the prospect of such an alliance, but Catherine pushed ahead with the wedding regardless, inviting the most prominent Huguenot nobles in the country to Paris for the celebrations, more extravagant and decadent than any of her famed entertainments. After three days of feasting, dancing and pageantry, the bells of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois rang out at midnight – a prearranged signal for Catholic troops to kill all the Huguenot leaders in Navarre’s entourage, off guard, undefended, many of them in their bedchambers. No one, even now, could say for certain who planned the assassinations or gave the initial command, but the bloodlust spread quickly through the streets; anyone known or suspected to be Protestant was cut down where he stood, or dragged out of bed to be murdered along with his family. Women, children, babies, grandmothers; corpses piled up in the gutters and clogged the river.</p>
<p class="indented">I was still in Italy at that time, but my friend Philip Sidney had been living in Paris and told of barricading himself into the English embassy along with Sir Francis Walsingham and his young family as the mob tried to break down the doors. Neither ever forgot the horror of that night: the screaming, the smell of blood, the sight of heads, limbs, entrails scattered in the streets the next morning as if on a battlefield. The shovelling up of corpses, so many that there was not room in Paris to bury them all, the unclaimed dead left to rot along the banks of the Seine. The memory of it drove every decision Walsingham made with regard to the defence of England; he believed the same horrors would come to London if Catholic forces invaded. When King Henri talks of an uprising, it is another Saint Bartholomew’s that he fears – as does every citizen of Paris, Catholic or Protestant. It is a fear that the Catholic League has learned to exploit, as the pamphlet I had found in Joseph’s room made clear.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What happened to your cousin?’ I asked the Count.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was <em class="calibre6">her </em>doing,’ he said, with unexpected vehemence, clutching at my hand. I felt his spittle fleck my cheek. ‘The soldiers came, demanding I give them up. I said I had not seen them. But they broke the doors down and ransacked my house. They found them all. Even their servants.’ He paused to draw a rattling breath. ‘I said I had not <em class="calibre6">seen</em> them,’ he repeated, in a hollow voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you were punished,’ I murmured, understanding. ‘For not seeing.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He took my eyes. And I thanked God, because then I was spared the sight of the little children lying in their gore. Would he had taken my life too. But he will not let me die. Nor will he let me live. He says he still has a use for me in here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who do you mean? Who blinded you?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">He heaved a great sigh. ‘You <em class="calibre6">know</em> who. Young Henri.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The King?’ I drew back, staring.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No. You are confused, boy. <em class="calibre6">Charles</em> is the king.’ The old man gripped my hand tighter. ‘I mean Henri Le Balafré.’</p>
<p class="indented">The Scarface. The popular nickname of Henri, Duke of Guise, on account of his prominent war wound.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you said it was <em class="calibre6">her</em> doing. Whose? Do you mean Catherine?’</p>
<p class="indented">It was asserted as fact by many that the Queen Mother had issued the order for the Protestant leaders to be killed, to isolate her new son-in-law and ensure he knew where his loyalties now lay. In her defence, people said, she had not anticipated how the flame of murder would catch and consume the entire city, and spread through France until perhaps seventy thousand Protestants lay slaughtered. But the uncomfortable fact remained that, before the bells rang out at midnight, someone’s agents had slipped silently through Paris, marking every Protestant home with a white cross, ready for the Angel of Death. There were plenty of others, of course, who pointed the finger at Guise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No more now,’ the Count said, his voice drained.</p>
<p class="indented">I let go of his hand and felt him slump against the wall beside me. He had been in this pit for so long he had no idea King Charles was dead, and his brother now on the throne. But his memory seemed sharp enough when it came to the terrible events that had brought him to this place. If it was true that he was being kept here by the Duke of Guise, then we must be in a Guise prison, and I had no prospect of sending word to anyone with the influence to save me. Another wave of panic overwhelmed me; I had to stand and pace the limits of that confined space before the pounding in my chest and head would subside. Perhaps after some weeks the King would notice I had disappeared, but would he make the effort to find me? Would he dare to confront Guise for my liberty, if I were still alive by then? I forced myself to cling to the gaoler’s words about food; if I was to be fed, they surely did not mean to kill me immediately. Cotin had said that the Abbé wanted me questioned about Paul Lefèvre; it was no great leap to suppose that it was Guise who was interested in the answers, and that the Abbé had handed me over. Perhaps I was only here as a prelude to interrogation – a thought which did not bring comfort. When I had brought my breathing under control again, I crouched beside the Count.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You were at court when Charles was king?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Another kind of prison,’ he murmured. It appeared he had not lost all his wits, then.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you ever hear mention of Circe?’ It was a long shot, I knew; the man had been shut away from the world for thirteen years. Much had changed at court since then, but perhaps not that much.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Circe.’ His voice drifted off again, as if he were searching his memory. He let out a bitter laugh. ‘I know that name.’</p>
<p class="indented">A small flame of hope flickered. ‘What does it mean? Is it a person? A woman?’</p>
<p class="indented">He took a long time to answer.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She is a witch,’ he said, at last. ‘A temptress. You must know this. She robs a man of his will, until he is no better than a beast.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know the story from the <em class="calibre6">Odyssey</em>, yes,’ I said, trying to hide my disappointment. ‘The enchantress who turned Odysseus’s men into pigs. But is there another Circe? Someone in Paris?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A temptress,’ he said, again, more forcefully this time, his voice weighted with contempt. ‘But they all are, behind the mask. They bewitch you, then betray you. You will learn, boy.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">He fell silent. I could not tell if he was speaking of Homer’s mythical enchantress, or someone specific, or women in general. If the latter, he need not have feared; I had already learned that lesson the hard way.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Perhaps I slept; it was difficult to tell down there in the unchanging dark. I tried to keep my mind occupied, anything to steer it away from the edge of despair. I had no idea how much time had passed before I was jolted back to awareness by the sound of the bolt and the sudden intrusion of light from the hatch.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oi. You. The foreign whoreson.’ The gaoler leered into the opening; I could see only his mouth and chin. ‘Seems Dame Fortune is smiling on you tonight, my friend.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I can’t remember when I felt luckier,’ I said. I guessed from his sarcasm that things were about to take a turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Shut your mouth and get on your feet against that wall while I fetch the ladder. Governor’s orders. Someone’s just paid your bail.’</p>
