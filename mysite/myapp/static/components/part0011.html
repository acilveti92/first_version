				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack checked Captain Sloames’s washstand for a third time. The carefully arranged toiletries were all in their allocated place, the pots of pills and the jars of potions and creams ordered and precise. He had stropped the razor, cleaned the brushes and combs, picked the stray hairs from the towel, filled one porcelain jug with hot water and another with cold. He made sure the washbowl was without stains or watermarks and the sheet on the floor was laid out evenly and blemish-free. He was certain that Sloames would have no cause to find fault this morning.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good morning, sir.’ Jack took a deep breath and pulled back the thin curtains that had been fighting an uneven battle against the early-morning sunlight. It was past ten yet Jack had delayed waking his master, knowing full well that he had not struggled home until the small hours of the morning after another heavy night of drinking in the officers’ mess. However, a meeting with the battalion adjutant had been arranged for noon and despite Jack’s silent prayers, Sloames had not stirred of his own volition.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A groan came from deep under the bed’s tousled coverings.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Coffee, sir?’ Jack stood dutifully at the foot of the bed, a cup of the first medicinal coffee of the morning in his hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good morning, Lark.’ Sloames’s muffled voice was feeble. ‘What time is it?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Past ten, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good God.’ Sloames pushed his way clear of the covers, emerging into the sunlight blinking furiously. ‘You mentioned coffee?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir.’ Jack stepped forward and carefully placed the china cup of steaming black coffee in Sloames’s trembling hand.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames peered at him over the brim of the scalding liquid. ‘You look like an overeager hound, Lark. Whatever is the matter? Goodness, my head.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’ll soon feel better, sir.’ Jack did his best to sound composed. He did not want Sloames to think he was anxious. ‘I have prepared your second-best uniform for your meeting with Captain Ramsay.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Very good.’ The coffee worked its restorative power and colour returned to Sloames’s cheeks, warming his former deathly pallor. ‘Good coffee.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, sir. The mess had fresh beans this morning.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames handed the empty cup back to his orderly before taking his head in both hands and ruffling his hair vigorously. ‘God, I feel awful.’ He stopped and looked up. ‘By God, that was a night. I suppose I should’ve learnt my lesson by now!’ Sloames smiled ruefully at his orderly, abashed yet obviously proud of his own fecklessness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled back at his officer, his charm impossible to ignore. Like all officers, Sloames was a hard drinker, the officers’ mess famous for its riotous nights. More often than not these evenings ended with some horseplay or mischief that would have the colonel wondering at his officers’ sanity. Only the other week a precious teapot had been smashed in an impromptu game of indoor cricket, much to the delight of the officers and to the despair of the colonel’s wife.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With a loud groan, Sloames pushed himself up from the bed. He staggered to the washstand and Jack leant backwards to make enough room for Sloames to pass without their bodies touching.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames made a quick appraisal of his toiletries. ‘Damn you, Lark! Can you do nothing right?’ He spat a thick wad of phlegm into the washbowl.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir?’ Jack stepped forward, his heart pounding as he tried to work out what he had done wrong.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames laughed at Jack’s horrified expression. ‘Just jesting, Lark. Just jesting. Everything is perfectly in order.’ He turned and threw two handfuls of water over his face. ‘You really are a hopeless cove.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack did his best to smile. He helped his officer through his morning wash routine, passing and taking items as they were needed or discarded.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Have you heard the rumours?’ Sloames lifted his chin high and started to scrape away the unwanted hairs, carefully trimming round his thick mutton-chop whiskers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Rumours, sir?’ Jack was immediately interested. For the officers’ orderlies, gossip and tittle-tattle were the common currency of their lives, sought as eagerly as the scattering of forgotten coins that could be slipped unnoticed into a diligent servant’s pocket – and as jealously husbanded.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do not play the innocent with me.’ Sloames looked at his orderly from the corner of his eye. ‘The rumour that we are to be posted.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’d heard something about that, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That doesn’t surprise me. Would it astonish you if it were true?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I suppose so, sir. I thought we’d be stuck here forever.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Would that suit you? Or have you the taste for adventure?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’ve never given it much thought, sir, if I’m honest.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Truly? I must confess that I think of little else. What could be worse than stagnating in this Godforsaken place? What glory is there to be won in Aldershot? What legacy will be left if I languish here and waste the prime years of my life?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There’s plenty of time, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’re wrong there.’ Sloames waved the razor at Jack to emphasise his point. ‘I’m fast approaching thirty years of age. Thirty! My life is slipping away. My father had fought a dozen battles in Spain and faced down the damn Frogs at Waterloo by the time he was my age. Whereas what have I done?’ Sloames gave Jack no time to answer, not that he would ever be unwise enough to offer a suggestion. ‘Nothing! I crave glory, Lark. Glory.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was keen to steer the conversation away from his master’s frustrated ambition and back towards the news that the battalion could be about to move. ‘So is the battalion to be posted overseas?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames nodded. ‘We are bound for the West Indies. To Jamaica, in fact.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The Indies!’ Jack could not contain his dismay. All soldiers dreaded this posting. Duty in the West Indies would be a death sentence to many. Yellow fever, dysentery and all manner of other Devil-inspired illnesses waited to strike down a newly arrived redcoat. Jack craved going overseas. But, dear God, not to the Indies. To go there was to die.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames paused in his shaving to stare at his orderly. ‘Your face betrays you. You no more want that destiny than I do.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, sir.’ Jack met Sloames’s stare as evenly as he could while his soul screamed at the injustice of the cursed news.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘All is not lost. There is hope. I have written to Horseguards expressing my willingness to exchange. I am sanguine of my chances. In my letter, I expressed a keen intention to serve my country on the field of battle. There is talk of a war in the East and I am hopeful there will be a less martially inspired soul who feels their talents would be best employed by remaining away from the rigours of a campaign.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I wish you luck, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There is no need for you’ll be coming with me. We’ll journey to the fields of battle together. What say you to that?’ Sloames tossed his razor into the bowl with a flourish and turned to face his orderly, his face alive with the prospect of going to war. ‘Can you see the future unravelling before us? We shall leave this mundane existence behind us and go to war.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack swallowed hard. Molly’s rumours had proved to be true.</p>
