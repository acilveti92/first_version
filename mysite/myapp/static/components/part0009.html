				<p class="h1-main-head-1-after-awh">Six months earlier. Aldershot Barracks, England</p>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The officer groaned with relief as he eased his heavy scarlet coat off his shoulders, the thick bullion epaulets jangling as he tossed it on to the iron bed that dominated the small room. He let out a sigh of tired exasperation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Lark!’ the officer barked. He listened for any sound that showed his servant was rushing to answer the summons. To his annoyance, he heard nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Lark!’ the tall officer bellowed for a second time, his voice rising in anger.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The officer’s servant half ran, half stumbled into the small bedroom, wiping his hands furiously on a stained lint cloth as he entered.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You don’t have time for that now, Lark.’ The officer’s face betrayed his annoyance despite his best attempts to keep it under control. ‘Where is my best uniform?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘In your cupboard, sir.’ Jack Lark was new to the ways of being an orderly. He still had much to learn.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What good is it there?’ Captain Arthur Sloames ran a hand over his thick, black, mutton-chop whiskers and through the mop of unruly hair that he would soon spend some time attempting to subdue. ‘You should have it out and ready.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sorry, sir.’ Jack looked around for a convenient spot to dump the stained cloth he was carrying. Seeing nowhere suitable he stuffed it into the waistband of his grey fatigues before making towards the tall, mahogany wardrobe that stood in the corner of the small room.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You cannot do it now, you fool. I have no intention of attending on the dowager countess this evening stinking like a damn navvy. Go and wash your hands thoroughly. I’ll do it myself.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Jack muttered a curse under his breath. He had forgotten to have his master’s finest uniform ready. The list of chores to be done in a single day was taking him too long. He knew he would have to work harder if he were to remain in his new position. He turned to hurry from the room, determined to wash quickly and make up for his error. He would not throw away the chance he had been given. An orderly was a step up from being an ordinary redcoat and Jack was desperate to succeed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Wait.’ Sloames snapped the curt command. ‘You can help me with my boots before you go.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The young captain turned his back and offered up his foot for Jack to hold. The two men were of a similar height, both a shade under six feet tall, yet their faces betrayed their relative status as eloquently as the badges of rank that adorned their uniforms. Sloames’s fleshy face and thick waistline betrayed his privileged lifestyle, his blue Oxford uniform trousers straining across his generous backside. Where Sloames was portly, Jack Lark was gaunt, his hard face and wiry physique the result of a youth spent in London’s slums. His ill-fitting fatigues may have hung from his sparse frame but his rolled shirtsleeves revealed a pair of finely muscled forearms. Jack may have lacked his officer’s bulk but there was strength in his sinewy build, strength that he needed as he strained to pull the tight, calf-length boots from his master’s feet.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You must try to improve, Lark,’ Sloames grunted as the first boot was tugged free. ‘I’d have thought you would’ve begun to get the hang of things by now.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sorry, sir.’ Jack bit his lip as he took a firm hold on the second boot. ‘I lost track of time.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What were you doing?’ Sloames sighed with pleasure as his right foot found freedom.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I was polishing your sword, sir. Coxy, I mean Private Cox, told me you would be likely to inspect it to make sure I was keeping on top of everything.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames chuckled. ‘He was right. You would do well to listen to Cox. He is a good man. Major Hume is fortunate indeed to have him. Let us hope you are as good one day.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’ll try my best, sir.’ Jack stood up and looked his officer in the eye. ‘Sorry about the uniform.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sloames dismissed Jack’s apology with a wave of his hand. ‘Quick now. Wash up and hurry back to help me get dressed. The colonel hates to be late and I cannot risk keeping him waiting.’ He fixed Jack with a warm smile. ‘Even us captains have to do as we are told.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘You’ll throw this chance away if you’re not careful.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack twisted away from Molly, his pleasure at seeing her waning in the face of her criticism.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I know, Molly. I’m not soft in the head.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, you will be if you mess this up.’ Molly stepped back into Jack’s arms, ignoring his churlish response. ‘You have to make something of yourself or we’ll never get anywhere.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">She and Jack had been together for nearly three months. He came to visit her in the garrison laundry often, his new life as an officer’s orderly giving him a freedom he could have only dreamt of as a simple redcoat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I won’t mess it up.’ Jack’s pride had been stung. He knew he had forgotten his master’s instructions and Captain Sloames was well within his rights to admonish him but he had hoped Molly would be more sympathetic.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’d better not. I can’t waste my time on a redcoat. I want to make something of my life, even if you don’t.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m not a waste of time. Sloames picked me to be his orderly, didn’t he?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, just don’t make him regret it.’ Molly moved back and brushed at his lapel where a few of her hairs lay. ‘I know you like being a servant but it’s not that much of a step up, is it? It’s not like being a corporal, or a sergeant.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m not a servant. I’m an orderly. It’s different.’ Jack’s fragile pride was offended. ‘It keeps me away from Colour Sergeant Slater and that is good enough for me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t know why you’re so frightened of Slater. He’s not that bad. I think he’s a fine figure of a man and he’s always nice to me when he comes in here. And <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">he</span>’s a sergeant.’ Molly reached for Jack’s face, her finger sliding over Jack’s smooth and unfashionably hair-free cheeks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Slater’s not a fine figure of a man.’ Jack looked at Molly warily, sensing she was showing more than a passing interest in his company’s colour sergeant. ‘He’s a bastard. If that’s what it takes to become a sergeant then it’s not for me, thank you very much.’ Jack’s words belied the ambition that burned brightly inside him. To be a sergeant would be the pinnacle of his time as a soldier. It was a position he was determined to achieve, his role as an orderly merely a stepping stone on his climb up the ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, I can just see you with them stripes. Why, you could even become an officer and have your own servant.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Orderly,’ Jack rebuked her. ‘I’m not about to become an officer. It’s not for the likes of me. You have to be born with a silver spoon in your muzzle to become an officer. If you have the money, you can become an officer. If you don’t then forget it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Some do it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Some do. But they never go far. Quartermaster is about all they’re good for. And even that’s as rare as finding gold in horseshit.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You give up too easy. You’ll never get anywhere if you don’t try. I can see it even if you can’t – you this big handsome officer and me your lady,’ Molly giggled at the wild fancy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled at the notion. ‘It’s never going to happen.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Molly’s hands disappeared behind her back, untying the knots that held her apron in place, her teasing smile making Jack’s heart race as he began to hope the afternoon’s visit would not be completely wasted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘My mam says you lot are going to be posted.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What?’ Molly’s darting train of thought often left Jack lumbering to keep up with her.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You lot is going to be posted. Mam says that Billy who looks after Major Dansen told her.’ Molly tossed her apron to one side and started to undo the buttons of her blouse.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Billy Burton don’t know shit.’ Jack tore his eyes from the glimpse of flesh and took hold of Molly’s hands to stop her undoing any more buttons. Her words had changed the focus of his thoughts. It was exciting news if it was true. The battalion had been stationed in Aldershot on garrison duty ever since he joined it four years previously. It was dull and Jack chafed at the routine life that ground out through the days and months. A posting would mean going abroad, seeing the world and, with any luck, doing some proper soldiering.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, my mam says he said it, so there. You don’t have to believe me.’ Molly pouted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Against his tanned skin the red rawness of her hands stood out vividly, the countless hours spent in hot water dealing with the battalion’s laundry taking its toll even on her young, seventeen-year-old skin.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I believe you. It’s that fool Billy I don’t trust.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I hope you don’t get posted. I wouldn’t know what to do if you up and left.’ Tears welled in Molly’s eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack brushed the tears from Molly’s cheeks. ‘Don’t fret. There’s always talk. Nothing is going to happen. It never does.’ Molly nestled into his arms, consoled and safe in his embrace. Jack rested his chin on the unruly curls pinned on top of her head. His heart raced, his hopes coming alive at the idea of leaving. For a posting might mean facing the harshest test a soldier could imagine: battle.</p>
