Nick Eichmann.”</p><h2 id="h21" class="calibre9">THE BLIND JEW’S DAUGHTER</h2><p class="calibre1" id="p277">In the late fall of 1957, Isser Harel received a strange message from <span class="ref-pnum">Frankfurt</span>, Germany. It said that Dr. Fritz Bauer, attorney general of Hesse, requests to convey some secret information to Mossad. Isser knew of Bauer, a much-respected figure in Germany. A tall, charismatic man with a pugnacious jaw, he was known for aggressively pursuing Nazi <span class="ref-pnum">criminals</span>. His leonine mane of white hair gave him a vague resemblance to David Ben-Gurion. Bauer, too, was Jewish, and a born fighter. In 1933, with Hitler’s ascension to power, he was thrown into a concentration camp. But the experience did not break his spirit. He later escaped to Denmark and then to Sweden. At the end of the war he decided to <span class="ref-pnum">devote</span> his life to the pursuit and punishment of Nazi criminals. And he <a id="pagebreak-rw_60"></a>was outspoken about his disappointment with West Germany’s <span class="ref-pnum">authorities</span>, who did little to uproot Nazism.</p><p id="p278" class="text-indent">In November 1957, Isser sent Shaul Darom, an Israeli security officer, to meet with Bauer. He arrived in Frankfurt and had a long conversation with the attorney general. A few days later, Darom walked into Isser’s office in Tel Aviv. “Dr. Bauer told me,” Darom said, “that Eichmann is alive, and he is hiding in Argentina.”</p><p id="p279" class="text-indent">Isser started. Like millions of Jews, he knew SS Colonel Adolf Eichmann as the embodiment of Nazi horror. The Obersturmbannführer Eichmann had personally directed “the final solution”—the systematic annihilation of European Jewry. He had devoted his life to the meticulous massacre of six million Jews. He had disappeared after the war, and nobody knew where he was; he was said to be living in Syria, Egypt, Kuwait, South America …</p><p id="p280" class="text-indent">Darom recounted in detail his conversation with Bauer. A few months earlier, Bauer had received a letter from Argentina, sent by a German <span class="ref-pnum">émigré</span>, half-Jewish, who had suffered under the Nazis during the war. He had read newspaper reports about Bauer’s relentless pursuit of Nazi criminals and knew that on top of that list of wanted men was Adolf Eichmann. When his daughter, Sylvia, told him she was dating a young man, Nick Eichmann, he was stunned. He thought that young Nick must be related to the missing mass murderer. He wrote to Bauer that he could lead his agents to Eichmann’s hideout; Eichmann was said to be living in Buenos Aires under a false identity.</p><p id="p281" class="text-indent">Bauer already knew that Eichmann had escaped from Germany after the war. His wife, Vera, and his three sons had stayed on in Austria, but a few years later they vanished. Eventually, Bauer found out that they had <span class="ref-pnum">emigrated</span> to Argentina, where Vera had remarried. Bauer was convinced that she had joined Eichmann and her second marriage was fictitious. “Her <span class="ref-pnum">second</span> husband” had to be Eichmann himself, who had been waiting for her.</p><p id="p282" class="text-indent">Bauer feared that if he asked the German government to request <span class="ref-pnum">Eichmann’s</span> extradition from Argentina, he’d lose him. He didn’t trust the <span class="ref-pnum">German</span> judicial branch, still full of former Nazis. He also suspected a few employees at the Buenos Aires German embassy. Bauer feared that even <a id="pagebreak-rw_61"></a>before an official extradition demand was handed to the Argentineans, somebody at the embassy or in Germany would warn Eichmann and he’d vanish again.</p><p id="p283" class="text-indent">Bauer spoke frankly with Shaul Darom. He wanted Mossad to find out if this man in Buenos Aires was indeed Eichmann; and, if so, Israel should demand his extradition or launch a covert operation and abduct Eichmann.</p><p id="p284" class="text-indent">“I am speaking to you after many days and nights of soul-searching,” Bauer admitted. “Only one man in Germany knows about my decision to give you this information, minister-president of Hesse Georg August Zinn (a Social-Democrat and a future president of Germany’s federal council, the Bundesrat).”</p><p id="p285" class="text-indent">Shaul Darom, now back in Israel, put on Isser’s desk a single sheet of paper, revealing Eichmann’s hideout. Isser’s eyes focused on one sentence: “4261 Calle Chacabuco, Olivos, Buenos Aires.”</p><p id="p286" class="text-indent">In early January 1958, a young man strolled down Calle Chacabuco. This was Emmanuel (Emma) Talmor, a member of Mossad special operations. Isser had sent him to check the accuracy of Bauer’s message. Emma didn’t like what he saw. Olivos was a poor neighborhood, inhabited mostly by <span class="ref-pnum">laborers</span>. On both sides of the unpaved Calle Chacabuco stood decrepit shacks, including number 4261. In its tiny courtyard Talmor noticed a fat, shabby woman.</p><p id="p287" class="text-indent">“I don’t believe that that could be Eichmann’s house,” Talmor said to Isser in his Tel Aviv office a few days later. “I’m certain that Eichmann transferred a ton of money to Argentina, like all the Nazi big shots, who prepared their escapes long before the Reich fell. I can’t believe he lives in such a hovel and such a slum. Nor can that fat woman in the courtyard be Vera Eichmann.”</p><p id="p288" class="text-indent">Talmor’s objections didn’t convince the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em>. Isser wanted to continue investigating, but he needed to contact Bauer’s source. He got in touch with Bauer, who immediately revealed the name and address of his informant: Lothar Hermann. He had now moved to another town, Coronel Suarez, about three hundred miles from Buenos Aires. Bauer sent Isser a letter of introduction, asking Hermann to do everything to assist the bearer of the letter.</p><p id="p289" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_62"></a>And in February 1958, an overseas visitor came to Coronel Suarez—Efraim Hoffstetter, head of investigation with the Tel Aviv police; he <span class="ref-pnum">happened</span> to be in Argentina for an Interpol conference and agreed to cooperate with Isser. But, being cautious, when he knocked on the door at Libertad Avenue, he introduced himself as a German, Karl Huppert. In the living room he saw a blind man, plainly dressed, his hands resting on a massive wooden table. As Hoffstetter walked in, the blind man heard his footsteps and turned toward him, groping for his hand. This was Lothar Hermann.</p><p id="p290" class="text-indent">“I am a friend of Fritz Bauer,” Hoffstetter said. He hinted that he was connected with Germany’s secret service.</p><p id="p291" class="text-indent">Hermann told him he was Jewish and had been a policeman until the Nazis took power. His parents had been murdered and he had been sent to Dachau, where he had lost his sight; he later emigrated to Argentina with his German wife. When he stumbled upon the name of Eichmann, he had contacted Bauer. His only motive, he claimed, was to help punish the Nazi criminals who had massacred his <span class="ref-pnum">family</span>.</p><p id="p292" class="text-indent">“You see,” he said, touching the arm of his daughter, Sylvia, who had entered. “She is the one who found Eichmann for you.”</p><p id="p293" class="text-indent">The girl blushed and hesitantly told Hoffstetter her story.</p><p id="p294" class="text-indent">Until a year and a half ago, she said, her family had lived in the Olivos neighborhood in Buenos Aires. There she’d met Nick Eichmann, a nice young man with whom she had had a few dates. She didn’t tell him that she was of Jewish origin, since the Hermanns were known as an Aryan family. But Nick didn’t mince his words. He had once remarked to her that the Germans should have finished the job and annihilated all the Jews. And on another occasion he mentioned that his father had served as an officer in the Wehrmacht during World War II and had fulfilled his duty to the Fatherland.</p><p id="p295" class="text-indent">Nick freely shared his views with Sylvia, but never invited her to his home. Even after her family left Buenos Aires and they exchanged letters, he withheld his home address, and had her write to him at a friend’s  address.</p><p id="p296" class="text-indent">This odd behavior triggered Lothar Hermann’s suspicions that Nick could be Eichmann’s son. He traveled with his daughter to Buenos Aires <a id="pagebreak-rw_63"></a>and took a bus to Olivos. Sylvia, with the help of some friends, found Nick Eichmann’s address, and even managed to enter the house on Calle <span class="ref-pnum">Chacabuco</span>. But Nick wasn’t home. There she met a balding man who wore spectacles and sported a thin mustache; he told her he was Nick’s father.</p><p id="p297" class="text-indent">Hermann now told Hoffstetter that he would agree to go again to <span class="ref-pnum">Buenos</span> Aires with Sylvia, to help pursue this investigation. Sylvia was needed to accompany her blind father everywhere, and to write and read his <span class="ref-pnum">correspondence</span>. Hoffstetter gave him a list of items he needed for the <span class="ref-pnum">definitive</span> identification of Eichmann: his photograph, present name, workplace, official documents about him, and his fingerprints. Hoffstetter and <span class="ref-pnum">Hermann</span> then established a secure system for corresponding, and Hoffstetter gave Hermann some money for expenses. Finally, he took a postcard out of his pocket and tore it in two. He gave one half to Hermann. “If somebody brings to you the other half,” he said, “you can tell him everything. He will be one of us.”</p><p id="p298" class="text-indent">Hoffstetter left them, returned to Israel, and reported to Isser.</p><p id="p299" class="text-indent">A few months later, Hermann’s report arrived at Mossad <span class="ref-pnum">headquarters</span>. He reported with enthusiasm that he had found out everything about Eichmann. The house on Calle Chacabuco had been built by an Austrian, Francisco Schmidt, ten years earlier. Schmidt had rented the house to two families: Daguto and Klement. Hermann emphatically claimed that Schmidt was Eichmann. He believed that Daguto and Klement only served as a cover. Isser asked his agent in Argentina to verify Hermann’s report. The man cabled back: “There is no doubt that Francisco Schmidt is not Eichmann. He does not live and has never lived in the house on Calle Chacabuco.”</p><p id="p300" class="text-indent">Isser concluded that Hermann was not reliable, and decided to end the investigation.</p><h2 id="h22" class="calibre9">THE MISTAKE</h2><p class="calibre1" id="p301">Isser’s decision was a huge mistake and it could have ruined Israel’s <span class="ref-pnum">opportunity</span> to capture Eichmann. One couldn’t help but wonder about the <a id="pagebreak-rw_64"></a>incompetence that plagued the early stages of the operation. How could a covert, complex investigation have been entrusted to an elderly, blind, and unskilled man? How could Mossad have taken seriously his mistaken identification of Eichmann? How could Isser have ignored the fact that Sylvia had visited Calle Chacabuco and met Nick Eichmann’s father? <span class="ref-pnum">Instead</span> of sending to Buenos Aires a professional investigator who could have checked the identities of the two tenants and the landlord, Isser simply walked away. This grave error, in particular, was unlike Isser.</p><p id="p302" class="text-indent">A year and a half later, Fritz Bauer came to Israel. He didn’t want to meet Isser Harel, whom he blamed for having failed to capture Eichmann. He went and met directly with Attorney General Haim Cohen, in <span class="ref-pnum">Jerusalem</span>. He let his anger explode when he described to Cohen the disgraceful handling of this investigation by Mossad.</p><p id="p303" class="text-indent">Haim Cohen summoned Isser and Zvi Aharoni, the Shabak chief <span class="ref-pnum">investigator</span>, to Jerusalem. Bauer was waiting in his office and accused Harel of botching the investigation. He also threatened that if Mossad was unable to carry out the mission, he would have no choice but to ask the German authorities to take it on. But it was not his threat that persuaded Harel to reopen the case. It was a new piece of information that Bauer had brought with him: two words that appeared to solve the mystery. Eichmann’s <span class="ref-pnum">fictitious</span> name in Argentina, Bauer revealed, was Ricardo Klement.</p><p id="p304" class="text-indent">All at once, Isser realized where he had gone wrong, and where his men had erred. Eichmann was actually one of the tenants on Calle Chacabuco. Not Schmidt—Klement.</p><p id="p305" class="text-indent">Hermann’s daughter had indeed dated Eichmann’s son, and the <span class="ref-pnum">Eichmann</span> family did live on Calle Chacabuco. But Hermann didn’t know that Eichmann had changed his name to Klement, and instead had mistakenly pointed him out as Francisco Schmidt. If Isser had done his job and sent skilled agents to investigate Hermann’s story, he would long ago have <span class="ref-pnum">discovered</span> Eichmann’s true identity.</p><p id="p306" class="text-indent">Isser now suggested to Cohen and Bauer that Zvi Aharoni be put in charge of the investigation. Aharoni was a tall, lean man with a clear <span class="ref-pnum">forehead</span>, a square mustache, and a razor-sharp mind. A German Jew himself, <a id="pagebreak-rw_65"></a>he was personally close to Cohen—but less so with Isser. Aharoni was still angry that, in 1958, when he had come to Buenos Aires on another case, Isser hadn’t tasked him with checking out the Hermann testimony. But that had to be forgotten. Today Isser badly needed Aharoni’s expertise.</p><p id="p307" class="text-indent">And so, in February 1960, Aharoni landed in Buenos Aires. He asked a friend, a local Jew, to have a look at the house on Calle Chacabuco. The man came back upset. The house was empty, he reported. A few painters and masons were refurbishing one of the two apartments—in fact, the <span class="ref-pnum">former</span> flat of the Klements. But they had left; destination unknown. Aharoni now had to devise a way to trace Klement without raising suspicion.</p><p id="p308" class="text-indent">In early March, a young Argentinean in a bellboy’s uniform came to the house on Calle Chacabuco. He was carrying a small, gift-wrapped <span class="ref-pnum">package</span> addressed to Nicholas Klement. It contained an expensive lighter and a perfumed card with a short inscription: “Dear Nick, greetings for your birthday.” It looked like a birthday present sent by a woman who wanted to remain anonymous.</p><p id="p309" class="text-indent">The messenger entered the flat, where a few painters were working, and asked for the Klement family, but most of the workers had no idea who the Klements were. One of the painters, though, told the bellboy he thought they had moved to the San Fernando neighborhood, on the other side of Buenos Aires. He then led the bellboy to a nearby workshop, where Nick Eichmann’s brother worked. He was a blond man named Dieter; but though his manners were pleasant, he refused to disclose the Klements’ new address. Nevertheless, the talkative Dieter told the bellboy that his father was temporarily working in the faraway city of Tucumán.</p><p id="p310" class="text-indent">The bellboy returned to Calle Chacabuco and kept pestering the <span class="ref-pnum">painters</span> with incessant questions. Finally he got to a man who vaguely recalled a new address for the Klements. “You should take the train down to San <span class="ref-pnum">Fernando</span> station,” he said. “Then you’ll take bus 203 and get off at Avijenda. Across the street you’ll see a kiosk. On its right, a bit apart from the other houses, you’ll see a small brick house. That’s the Klement home.”</p><p id="p311" class="text-indent">The delighted messenger hurried back and reported to Aharoni. The next day Aharoni took the train to San Fernando, followed the painter’s <a id="pagebreak-rw_66"></a>instructions, and found the house at once. At the nearby kiosk he stopped and inquired about the name of the street.</p><p id="p312" class="text-indent">“Calle Garibaldi,” the old vendor told him.</p><p id="p313" class="text-indent">The investigation was back on track.</p><h2 id="h23" class="calibre9">CALLE GARIBALDI</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara23">In mid-March, Aharoni put on a business suit and headed to a house on Calle Garibaldi, across the street from the Klement home. “I represent an American company,” he said to the woman who opened the door. “We manufacture sewing machines and we are looking to build a factory in this area. We would like to buy your house.” And then he added, pointing at the Klement home: “And that house as well. Would you like to sell?”</p><p id="p314" class="text-indent">While chatting with the woman, Aharoni kept pressing a button <span class="ref-pnum">concealed</span> in the handle of a small case he was carrying. It activated a hidden camera that took pictures of the Klement house from various angles.</p><p id="p315" class="text-indent">The next day Aharoni checked the city archives, and found that the lot on which the Klement home sat belonged to Ms. Vera Liebl de Eichmann, proof that Vera hadn’t married again, and, following Argentinean <span class="ref-pnum">custom</span>, she had registered the deed in both her maiden and married names. Ricardo Klement apparently chose not to be mentioned in official <span class="ref-pnum">documents</span>.</p><p id="p316" class="text-indent">Aharoni returned to Calle Garibaldi several times, on foot, by private car or small truck, and took photos of the house, Vera, and of the little boy he saw playing in the yard. He did not see Klement, but he decided to wait for a special date: March 21. Aharoni’s file indicated that this would be the twenty-fifth wedding anniversary of Adolf Eichmann and Vera Liebl. He expected Eichmann would return from Tucumán, to celebrate this with his family.</p><p id="p317" class="text-indent">On March 21, Aharoni returned with his camera. In the courtyard, he saw a thin, balding man of average height, with a thin mouth, a big nose, and a mustache; he was wearing spectacles. These features all matched the description in his intelligence file.</p><p id="p318" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_67"></a>Eichmann.</p><p id="p319" class="text-indent">In Israel, Isser drove to Ben-Gurion’s house. “We have located <span class="ref-pnum">Eichmann</span> in Argentina,” he said. “I think we can capture him and bring him to Israel.”</p><p id="p320" class="text-indent">Ben-Gurion immediately responded. “Bring him dead or alive,” he said. He thought for a moment and added: “It would be better to bring him alive. This will be very important for our youth.”</p><h2 id="h24" class="calibre9">THE ADVANCE TEAM ARRIVES</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara24">Isser formed the operational team. All of its twelve members were <span class="ref-pnum">volunteers</span>. Some were Holocaust survivors, with concentration camp numbers tattooed on their forearms. The core of the team was the operational unit of the security services. At its head were the two top agents of the Shabak. Rafi Eitan was appointed commander. At his side was Zvi Malkin, whom Eitan described as “brave, physically strong, and endowed with tactical creativity.” A balding man with bushy eyebrows, strong jaw, and deep, <span class="ref-pnum">melancholy</span> eyes, he was known as the best spy-catcher of the Shabak. He never carried a gun (“one may be tempted to use it”), he relied on “common sense, inventiveness, and improvisation” and had unmasked several top Soviet agents. He’d spent some of his childhood in Poland, and <span class="ref-pnum">immigrated</span> with his family to Israel after a bloody pogrom in the village of <span class="ref-pnum">Grasnik</span> Lubelski. Only his sister Fruma and her family had stayed behind; all of them and Zvi’s other relatives perished in the Holocaust. He grew up in Haifa and fought in the Independence War. Among his many talents were painting, writing “compulsively,” and acting. During a stay in New York he had become close with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, and had learned a lot from him about acting. “In many of the Mossad operations in which I participated,” he later said, “I played as if I were on stage, using disguises and makeup. In other operations I felt as if I was directing a play. I wrote out my operational orders like screenplays.”</p><p id="p321" class="text-indent">Another team member was Vienna-born Avraham (Avrum) Shalom, a stocky, tight-lipped man who was Eitan’s deputy, and a future Shabak <a id="pagebreak-rw_68"></a>director. Some of the others were Yaacov Gat, a discreet Paris-based field operative; Moshe Tavor, a former soldier in the British Army and a member of the secret “Avengers” group that hunted Nazi criminals at the end of the war, some of whom he had personally killed; and quiet, self-effacing <span class="ref-pnum">Shalom</span> Danny, a talented painter and “a genius” in document forging. Some claimed that he had escaped a Nazi concentration camp by forging an <span class="ref-pnum">authorization</span> on toilet paper.</p><p id="p322" class="text-indent">Most of the men were married, with families.</p><p id="p323" class="text-indent">The team was also well composed professionally. Efraim Ilani knew <span class="ref-pnum">Argentina</span> well and was familiar with the streets of Buenos Aires. He was a skilled locksmith, a man of great physical strength, and an agent with a very “honest” face who could inspire trust in anyone. Yehudith Nissiyahu, a religious woman and the best female agent in Mossad, also volunteered. Yehudith was quiet, shy, unobtrusive, rather overweight and plain. She was married to a Labor Party activist, Mordechai Nissiyahu. She hosted one of the authors of this book several times, and there was nothing in her <span class="ref-pnum">behavior</span> that appeared out of the <span class="ref-pnum">ordinary</span>.</p><p id="p324" class="text-indent">Dr. Yona Elian, a physician who had participated in several Mossad operations in the past, would be there to assist in bringing Eichmann back to Israel. Zvi Aharoni, the investigator, also joined. But the first volunteer to join the team was Isser himself. He loved to lead his men in dangerous operations abroad. But this time, he knew that in the course of taking <span class="ref-pnum">action</span>, immediate decisions at the top level would need to be made. And this could also have far-reaching political consequences. It was therefore crucial that the Israelis be led by someone who could make political decisions if necessary. Isser felt he had to assume command.</p><p id="p325" class="text-indent">At the end of April, an advance team of four agents entered Argentina from different directions. They smuggled essential equipment into the country: walkie-talkies, electronic tools and instruments, medical <span class="ref-pnum">supplies</span>, and also a part of Shalom Danny’s ambulant lab, equipped to <span class="ref-pnum">produce</span> passports, documents, and affidavits.</p><p id="p326" class="text-indent">They rented an apartment in Buenos Aires (code-named “the Castle”), <a id="pagebreak-rw_69"></a>where several team members would live and work, and stocked it with food. The following day the four rented a car and drove to San Fernando, arriving there at seven forty <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.</p><p id="p327" class="text-indent">Darkness had fallen and they got a big surprise. While driving slowly on route 202, they suddenly saw, walking directly toward them, Ricardo Klement! He paid them no attention, simply turned and entered his house.</p><p id="p328" class="text-indent">The agents concluded that Klement probably came home every evening at approximately the same time, and his capture could be carried out on this deserted dark stretch between the bus station and his home.</p><p id="p329" class="text-indent">That night, they wired Israel, in code: “Operation feasible.”</p><h2 id="h25" class="calibre9">A PLANE FOR ABBA EBAN</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara25">Isser felt he was in luck. He learned that on May 20 Argentina would <span class="ref-pnum">celebrate</span> the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence. <span class="ref-pnum">High-ranking</span> delegations would be coming from all over the world to participate in the festivities. An Israeli delegation headed by Minister of Education Abba Eban would also come. Abba Eban was happy to learn that El Al would be putting at his disposal a special plane—a Britannia “Whispering Giant.” Nobody told Eban that the real reason for El Al’s generosity was Operation Eichmann.</p><p id="p330" class="text-indent">Flight 601 to Buenos Aires had been scheduled for May 11. The plane crew was carefully selected and Isser had revealed the secret only to two of El Al’s senior officials, Mordechai Ben-Ari and Efraim Ben-Artzi. The pilot, Zvi Tohar, was advised to take a qualified mechanic with him, in case the plane suddenly had to take off without the assistance of an Argentinean land crew.</p><p id="p331" class="text-indent">On May 1, at dawn, Isser landed in Buenos Aires with a European passport. A freezing wind swept the airport runways. In Argentina, it was almost winter. Eight days later, on the evening of May 9, several <span class="ref-pnum">Israelis</span> slipped into a new apartment building in Buenos Aires. They went up to an apartment that had been rented a few days earlier (code-named <a id="pagebreak-rw_70"></a>“Heights”). All members of the operational unit were present. Earlier, they had settled in various hotels around town. The last to enter was Isser; for the first time, “the twelve” were together.</p><p id="p332" class="text-indent">Since coming to Argentina, Isser had established an ingenious mode of communication with his team: in his pocket, he carried a list of three hundred cafés in Buenos Aires, with their addresses and their hours of <span class="ref-pnum">operation</span>. Every morning he would set out on a walking tour, going between these cafés, following an itinerary and a timetable he had designated <span class="ref-pnum">beforehand</span>. This way his men knew exactly where he could be found at every <span class="ref-pnum">moment</span> of the day. The one big inconvenience in this system was the gallons of strong Argentinean coffee that the <em class="calibre7">ramsad</em> had to absorb in these daily circuits. From the cafés Isser directed preparations for the abduction.</p><p id="p333" class="text-indent">These were days of feverish activity: bringing and setting up equipment needed for keeping a prisoner; renting cars for surveillance and for the <span class="ref-pnum">capture</span>; renting additional apartments and secluded villas out of town, where Eichmann would be held. The most important villa (“the Base”) was on the way to the airport. It was rented by two Mossad agents posing as tourists. One of them was Yaacov Meidad (Mio), a stocky, German-born man who had lost his parents in the Holocaust and fought in the British Army during the war. The woman who played the role of his companion was Yehudith Nissiyahu. Within the villa the agents built a hiding place for Eichmann and his guard, if the local police were ever to investigate. A second flat was prepared as an alternative.</p><p id="p334" class="text-indent">The plan now was for Eichmann to be captured on May 10, the plane to arrive on May 11, and on May 12, to set off for Israel.</p><p id="p335" class="text-indent">But a last-moment change destroyed the plan. Because of the great number of visitors coming for the anniversary celebrations, the Protocol Department of the Argentinean Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Israeli delegation that they would have to delay their arrival until May 19, at two <span class="smallcaps">P.M.</span> For Isser that meant either delaying Eichmann’s capture till May 19—or executing the plan on May 10 and then waiting in hiding with their captive for nine or ten days. That could be very risky, especially if, at his family’s request, an intensive search was organized for the missing man. <a id="pagebreak-rw_71"></a>There was a real danger that Eichmann and his Israeli abductors might be found by the police.</p><p id="p336" class="text-indent">Despite reservations, Isser decided to move ahead as originally planned; but because of his people’s fatigue, he chose to push it back one day. D-day was set for May 11, and H-hour for seven forty <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.</p><p id="p337" class="text-indent">The operational plan was now laid out and ready in minute detail: Eichmann returned from work every evening at seven forty <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>. He got off bus 203 at the kiosk and walked home along Calle Garibaldi. The street was dark, traffic was sparse. The operation would be carried out by agents in two cars: one team for the abduction, another for security and <span class="ref-pnum">protection</span>. The first car would be parked at the roadside with its hood raised, and the agents would appear to be repairing it. When Eichmann passed by them, they would jump him, overpower him, and throw him into the car. It would then at once dart forward, with the other car following. The doctor would travel in the second car, to be close by in case the captive needed to be drugged.</p><p id="p338" class="text-indent">Isser, in a strict tone, gave precise orders. “If you run into any kind of trouble,” he said, “you do not let go of Eichmann even if you’re stopped. If the police arrest you, say that you are Israelis, acting on your own, to bring this Nazi criminal to justice.” All those who escape arrest, he added, leave the country according to the current plan.</p><p id="p339" class="text-indent">He also instructed Meidad and Yehudith Nissiyahu to move into the villa and act like a couple of tourists. “Every so often come out and make yourselves comfortable on the lawn with snacks and newspapers.”</p><p id="p340" class="text-indent">All the other agents were ordered to leave their hotels and move to designated safe houses.</p><h2 id="h26" class="calibre9">COUNTDOWN</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara26">May 11, morning.</p><p id="p341" class="text-indent">The operational unit completed its preparations. Even before H-hour, the men had started covering their tracks. Most of the rented vehicles were <span class="ref-pnum">returned</span>. All members of the group had their disguises in place—makeup, <a id="pagebreak-rw_72"></a>false mustaches, beards, and wigs. Each got new documents that suited their new faces. The twelve who had arrived in Buenos Aires a few days back—who walked the streets, rented cars and apartments, checked into hotels, surveyed the house on Calle Garibaldi—vanished; twelve others, looking different, carrying different documents with different names, took their place.</p><p id="p342" class="text-indent">Isser, too, left his hotel, checked his luggage at the railroad station, and returned to the city. Today, as every day, he would keep moving between the cafés. His movements today were in a business and entertainment area, where the cafés were at barely a five-minute walk from one to the next.</p><p id="p343" class="text-indent">1:00 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—Isser, Rafi Eitan, and a few of the lead operatives met for a final briefing in a big restaurant in the city center. All around them, merry Argentineans laughed, drank, and devoured local grilled meats. At 2:00 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>., the team dispersed.</p><p id="p344" class="text-indent">2:30 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—In a large midtown parking garage, the agents took the <span class="ref-pnum">capture</span> car that had been there for a few days, and drove it to “the Base.” The second car set off from another garage.</p><p id="p345" class="text-indent">3:30 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—The two cars were stationed by “the Base,” ready to move.</p><p id="p346" class="text-indent">4:30 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—Last briefing in “the Base.” The operational unit guys changed clothes, took their papers, and prepared to leave.</p><p id="p347" class="text-indent">6:30 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—The two cars departed. Four agents were in the capture car: Zvi Aharoni as the driver; Rafi Eitan, the commander; Moshe Tavor and Zvi Malkin. Three more agents were in the second car: Avraham Shalom, Yaacov Gat, and Dr. Elian, who carried a case with drugs, instruments, and sedatives.</p><p id="p348" class="text-indent">The cars arrived separately and met at a crossroads, not far from the <span class="ref-pnum">Klement</span> house. The agents checked the area and established that there were no checkpoints or police forces nearby.</p><p id="p349" class="text-indent">7:35 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—The two cars parked on Calle Garibaldi. Thick darkness had settled over the place already. The capture car, a black Chevrolet sedan, was parked at the sidewalk, turned toward the Klement house. Two agents got out and raised the hood; Aharoni remained at the wheel, and the fourth man crouched inside the car, watching the spot where Eichmann was <span class="ref-pnum">expected</span> to emerge from the dark. One of the men put on thin gloves, in <a id="pagebreak-rw_73"></a>case he had to touch Eichmann; the very thought of touching him filled him with disgust. Across the street was the second car, a black Buick. Two agents got out and busied themselves around the car. The third remained in the driver’s seat, ready to turn on his lights and blind Klement as he <span class="ref-pnum">approached</span>. The trap was set.</p><p id="p350" class="text-indent">But Klement didn’t show.</p><p id="p351" class="text-indent">7:40 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—Bus 203 stopped at the corner, but nobody got out.</p><p id="p352" class="text-indent">7:50 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—Two more buses came, one after the other. Klement was in neither. Anxiety swelled through the agents. What had happened? Had he changed his habits? Did he smell danger and flee?</p><p id="p353" class="text-indent">8:00 <span class="smallcaps">P.M.</span>—At an earlier briefing, Isser had told the group that if Klement didn’t show by eight, they were to abort and leave. Rafi Eitan, though, <span class="ref-pnum">decided</span> to wait until eight thirty.</p><p id="p354" class="text-indent">8:05 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—Another bus stopped at the corner. At first the Israelis saw nothing. But Avrum Shalom, who was in the second team, suddenly <span class="ref-pnum">discerned</span> a silhouette coming along Calle Garibaldi. Klement! He turned on his lights, aiming a blinding beam at the approaching figure.</p><p id="p355" class="text-indent">Ricardo Klement was walking toward his house. The dazzling lights struck him in the face and he averted his eyes. He kept walking. He noticed a car by the side of the road—probably engine trouble—and a few people beside it. At that moment, a man by the Chevrolet turned to him. “<em class="calibre7"><span class="ref-pnum">Momentito</span>, señor</em>” (Just a moment), he said. It was Zvi Malkin, using the only two words he knew in Spanish.</p><p id="p356" class="text-indent">Klement reached for the flashlight in his pocket, one he often used in this dark part of the street. Then it all happened with lightning speed. <span class="ref-pnum">Malkin</span> feared Klement was drawing a gun. He leaped on Klement and threw him on the dirt at the roadside. Klement let out a loud, shrill shout. From the car, another man, and another, sprung on him. Strong arms took hold of his head and covered his mouth. They pulled him into the back of the car and laid him, stunned, on its floor. The driver started the car and it darted forward. Barely half a minute had passed between the moment <span class="ref-pnum">Klement</span> appeared and the car’s departure.</p><p id="p357" class="text-indent">Seconds later, the other car took off and followed.</p><p id="p358" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_74"></a>Agile hands quickly tied Klement’s hands and feet. And somebody stuck a rag in his mouth. His glasses were removed and replaced by opaque black spectacles. A voice barked in German, close to his ear: “One move and you’re dead!” He obeyed; for the entire trip he didn’t budge. Meanwhile, two hands slipped under his clothes and felt his skin. Rafi Eitan’s hands were searching for his scars—one under the left armpit, one on the right side of his belly. Eitan looked at Malkin, and nodded. They shook hands. Eichmann was in their grasp.</p><p id="p359" class="text-indent">Eitan thought he had his feelings under control. But then he suddenly realized that he was humming the song of the Jewish partisans in the war against the Nazis, and repeating the refrain: “We are here! We are here!”</p><p id="p360" class="text-indent">The car was moving very fast, then suddenly stopped, its engine still running. Klement could not know that it was for a train barrier. The two capture cars had to wait long minutes while an endless freight train passed. This felt to the agents like the most critical moment in the entire <span class="ref-pnum">operation</span>. Their cars were surrounded by other cars, all waiting for the barrier to be raised. Outside voices could be heard, but Klement didn’t dare move. None of the Argentineans alongside them noticed anything strange lying on the car’s floor. Minutes later, the barrier was raised and the cars all smoothly moved forward.</p><p id="p361" class="text-indent">20:55 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—The two cars came to a stop in the driveway of “the Base.” Klement, trudging like a blind man between his captors, was ushered into the house. He did not object when the men holding him started undressing him. They demanded in German that he open his mouth. He obeyed. They checked inside it, searching for a poison capsule perhaps lodged between his teeth. Still wearing opaque glasses, he didn’t see a thing, but felt hands checking his body again and touching his scars. An expert hand slipped under his left armpit and touched the tiny scar that remained, when, a few years ago, he had tried to remove the small tattoo of his blood type, <span class="ref-pnum">customary</span> among SS officers.</p><p id="p362" class="text-indent">Suddenly a voice rang out in German.</p><p id="p363" class="text-indent">“The size of your hat … your shoes … date of birth … father’s name … mother’s name …”</p><p id="p364" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_75"></a>Like a robot, he answered in German. Even when they asked, “What is the number of your Nazi Party card? Your number in the SS?” he couldn’t stay silent.</p><p id="p365" class="text-indent">45326. And another number, 63752.</p><p id="p366" class="text-indent">“Your name?”</p><p id="p367" class="text-indent">“Ricardo Klement.”</p><p id="p368" class="text-indent">“Your name?” the voice repeated.</p><p id="p369" class="text-indent">He shivered. “Otto Heninger.”</p><p id="p370" class="text-indent">“Your name?”</p><p id="p371" class="text-indent">“Adolf Eichmann.”</p><p id="p372" class="text-indent">A silence settled around him. He broke it. “I am Adolf Eichmann,” he repeated. “I know that I am in the hands of the Israelis. I also know some Hebrew, I studied with a rabbi in Warsaw …”</p><p id="p373" class="text-indent">He recalled some verses of the Bible and started reciting them, trying to speak the Hebrew words with the proper pronunciation.</p><p id="p374" class="text-indent">No one else spoke.</p><p id="p375" class="text-indent">The Israeli boys stared at him, stupefied.</p><h2 id="h27" class="calibre9">A MESSENGER TO SDEH BOKER</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara27">Isser was moving from one café to another. It was late at night when he entered another café and slumped in a chair facing the door. Suddenly he saw two of his men at the entrance. He jumped up. “We got him,” Aharoni said, beaming. “He’s been definitely identified and he’s confessed that he is Adolf Eichmann.”</p><p id="p376" class="text-indent">Isser shook their hands and they left. Now he had to go back to the <span class="ref-pnum">railroad</span> station, pick up his suitcase, and check into a new hotel under his new identity, as if he had just arrived in Buenos Aires. The night air was cool and crisp and he decided to walk. He had been running a slight fever and suffering from a cold, but now he felt wonderful. He walked, alone in the dark, enjoying the cool night air and feeling uplifted—the kind of <span class="ref-pnum">intoxication</span> he would never forget.</p><p id="p377" class="text-indent">The next day a car stopped by a wooden cabin in kibbutz Sdeh Boker. A <a id="pagebreak-rw_76"></a>thin man, wearing glasses, came out of the car, showed his ID to the guards, and entered Ben-Gurion’s study. This was Yaacov Caroz, Isser’s close aide.</p><p id="p378" class="text-indent">“Isser sent me,” he said. “We got a cable from him. Eichmann is in our hands.”</p><p id="p379" class="text-indent">The Old Man was silent. Then he asked: “When is Isser coming back? I need him.”</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line12"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara28">Looking at the distraught faces of his men, Isser realized how Eichmann’s very presence in their company was depressing them. The German monster was next to them, now, separated by only a thin wall—and that unnerved these tough people and filled them with disgust. They couldn’t get used to looking after a man who, in their eyes, was the symbol of evil; who, for many of them, had been the murderer of their closest relatives—fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, all vanished in the crematoriums. And <span class="ref-pnum">taking</span> care of Eichmann meant tending to his needs twenty-four hours a day. They couldn’t give him a razor, so they shaved him; they couldn’t leave him alone for a second, lest he commit suicide; they had to be with him even when he went to the toilet. Yehudith Nissiyahu cooked and served Eichmann’s meals, but refused to wash the dishes from which he ate. Her repulsion for him overwhelmed her. Zvi Malkin, sitting in a corner, fought his disgust by drawing sketches of Eichmann on an old copy of <em class="calibre7">A Guide to South America</em>. The guards, who changed every twenty-four hours, were on edge, and Isser felt he had to give each of them a day’s leave. Let them walk about Buenos Aires, he thought, taste the bustling life of this big city, and for a few hours forget the obscene reality at “the Base.”</p><p id="p380" class="text-indent">These were becoming the ten longest days of their lives—hiding <span class="ref-pnum">themselves</span> in a foreign country, and living in fear of a tiny mistake that could trigger a police raid and an international scandal.</p><h2 id="h28" class="calibre9">PLANNING THE ESCAPE</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara29">Eichmann sat in a bare room, with no windows, illuminated day and night by a lone bulb. He was obedient and readily fulfilled his guards’ <span class="ref-pnum">instructions</span>. <a id="pagebreak-rw_77"></a>It seemed as if he had resigned himself to his fate. The only one who spoke with him was Aharoni, who interrogated him about his life prior to his capture. Eichmann answered all the questions. He told Aharoni that after Germany’s defeat in May 1945, he had assumed the identity of a Luftwaffe private, Adolf Karl Barth. He later posed as a lieutenant in the Twenty-second Waffen-SS Cavalry Division, Otto Eckmann, and was <span class="ref-pnum">incarcerated</span> in a POW camp. At the end of that year, when his name was <span class="ref-pnum">introduced</span> in the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazis, he escaped from the camp. As Otto Heninger, he hid until 1950 in Zelle in Lower Saxony and that same year escaped to Argentina, via Italy, using one of the escape routes of Nazi criminals.</p><p id="p381" class="text-indent">Nine years had passed since he disembarked in Argentina, dressed in a white shirt, bow tie, and winter coat, wearing sunglasses and sporting a pencil-thin mustache. He spent four months with friends in the Jurmann pension in a Buenos Aires suburb and four more months at the home of a German contact named Rippler. Only then did he risk moving around alone and left Buenos Aires for Tucumán, a small town about six hundred miles away. There he was employed by Capri, a little-known construction firm, said to be a cover company whose mission was to supply fugitive Nazis with jobs.</p><p id="p382" class="text-indent">On April 4, 1952, Eichmann received his Argentinean ID card in the name of Ricardo Klement, born in Bolzano, Italy, unmarried, mechanic by profession.</p><p id="p383" class="text-indent">A year before, in early 1951, Eichmann, using a false name, had sent a letter to his wife in Austria. He informed her that “the uncle of her children, the man she believed dead, actually was alive and well.” Vera Liebl <span class="ref-pnum">immediately</span> recognized his handwriting and told her sons that Uncle Ricardo, their dead father’s cousin, had invited them to join him in Argentina.</p><p id="p384" class="text-indent">She obtained a legal passport for herself and for her children. The <span class="ref-pnum">secret</span> Nazi machine kicked into feverish action and took care of blurring and erasing Vera’s tracks. When Israeli secret agents finally got their hands on the “Vera Liebl” file in the Austrian archives, what they found was an empty folder the contents of which had seemingly evaporated.</p><p id="p385" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_78"></a>In June 1952, Vera Liebl and her three sons, Horst, Dieter, and Klaus vanished from their home in Austria. In early July they surfaced briefly in Genoa, and on July 28 they came ashore in Buenos Aires. On August 15, they got off the train in the dusty Tucumán station.</p><p id="p386" class="text-indent">“Vera Eichmann,” Moshe Pearlman wrote in his book, “still carried in her memory the picture of the dashing Nazi officer, who looked so <span class="ref-pnum">impressive</span> in his dress uniform and shining boots. But the man who waited for her on the Tucumán platform was a middle-aged man, modestly dressed, his face pale and wrinkled, his expression depressed and his walk slow. This was her Adolf.”</p><p id="p387" class="text-indent">Eichmann the Terrible had become unrecognizable. He had gotten thin and was balding, his cheeks were sunken and his face had lost the air of arrogance that had been so characteristic of him. He appeared resigned and anxious; only his thin lips still suggested cruelty and malice.</p><p id="p388" class="text-indent">In 1953, Capri went bankrupt and Eichmann had to search for a job. First he tried opening a laundry in Buenos Aires with two other Nazis, then worked on a rabbit farm, and later in a fruit juice cannery. Finally, with the help of another secret Nazi organization, Ricardo Klement was appointed a foreman at the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Suárez. By then he had started believing that he would end his life peacefully. Until May 11, 1960.</p><p id="p389" class="text-indent">Meanwhile, Eichmann’s sons searched for him in hospitals, morgues, and police stations; they turned for help to the Fascist-Peronist youth <span class="ref-pnum">organization</span> Tacuara, which joined the search. But Eichmann’s sons soon concluded that the Israelis must have captured their father. They then tried but failed to convince the pro-Nazi organizations to take some drastic <span class="ref-pnum">action</span>, perhaps kidnap the Israeli ambassador and hold him until their father was released; but the Argentineans refused.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line13"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara30">Isser instructed his men about what to do if the hideout was located by the police. If they raid “the Base,” Isser said, Eichmann should be rushed to the secret chamber that had been prepared inside the house. If the police set out to do a thorough search, Eichmann was to be whisked out of the <a id="pagebreak-rw_79"></a>house by a side exit that had been specifically set for such an emergency. Several agents were to escape with Eichmann, while the others were to do anything possible to hinder the search, despite the risks that might involve.</p><p id="p390" class="text-indent">To whoever would be with Eichmann, Isser said, “If the police find the hideout and break in, handcuff yourself to him and throw away the keys, so they won’t be able to tear you away from him. Tell them that you’re <span class="ref-pnum">Israeli</span>, and together with your friends you have captured the world’s most hated criminal, Adolf Eichmann, in order to bring him to trial. Then give the police my real name—Isser Harel—as well as my false identity, and the name of the hotel where I am staying. If they get hold of you and of Eichmann—I’m to be arrested as well.”</p><p id="p391" class="text-indent">A few days later, Eichmann agreed to sign a document, stipulating that he was willing to be taken to Israel and put on trial there. It read:</p><div class="extract" id="extract1"><p class="text-indent" id="text-indent1">I, the undersigned Adolf Eichmann, of my own free will hereby <span class="ref-pnum">declare</span>: now that my real identity has been discovered, I recognize that there is no further use in trying to evade the course of justice. I agree to be taken to Israel and stand trial before a qualified tribunal. It is understood that I shall be given the assistance of an advocate and that I shall be permitted to lay before the court, without travesty of the facts, an account of the last years of my service in Germany, so that a truthful description of those events may be passed on to the future generations. I am making this declaration of my own accord. Nothing has been promised to me and I have not been threatened. My desire is to find inner peace at last.</p><p class="text-indent" id="p392">As I am unable to remember all the details, and may become <span class="ref-pnum">confused</span> when stating the facts, I ask that the relevant documents and testimonies be placed at my disposal to help me in my efforts to <span class="ref-pnum">establish</span> the truth.</p><p class="text-indent" id="p393">Adolf Eichmann, Buenos Aires, May 1960.</p></div><p class="text-indent" id="text-indent16">This declaration, of course, had no legal validity. <a id="pagebreak-rw_80"></a></p><h2 id="h29" class="calibre9">THE PLANE ARRIVES</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara32">May 18, 1960, 11:00 <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>.</p><p id="p394" class="text-indent">A formal ceremony took place at Lod International Airport near Tel Aviv. Many high-ranking personalities, including the chief of staff General Laskov, the director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the <span class="ref-pnum">Argentinean</span> ambassador to Israel, came to see off the impressive delegation to Argentina, for the one hundred fiftieth anniversary celebration. The El Al “Whispering Giant” took off, also carrying some regular passengers, bound for stopovers along the way.</p><p id="p395" class="text-indent">Few of the passengers noticed that in Rome three more civilians came aboard. After a couple of hours, these new passengers had become El Al crew members and were moving in the aisles in El Al uniforms. Actually, they were Mossad agents en route to assist their colleagues in Buenos Aires. One of them was Yehuda Carmel, a bald fellow with a prominent nose and a thin mustache. He was not very happy about this trip. He knew he had been chosen not because of his talents but because of his outward appearance. A few days earlier he had been called to his boss’s office, where he saw two photos on the desk—his own and one of an unknown man. They looked very similar. When he was told that the unknown man was Adolf Eichmann, he shuddered. He was even more shocked when he was told that he had been chosen to serve as Eichmann’s double. Isser’s plan was to bring Carmel to Argentina as an El Al crew member, to take his uniform and documents, and then use these to get a drugged <span class="ref-pnum">Eichmann</span> on the plane. Carmel carried an Israeli passport in the name of Ze’ev Zichroni.</p><p id="p396" class="text-indent">Isser had also prepared a backup plan. He summoned, with the help of a go-between, a young kibbutz member, Meir Bar-Hon, who was <span class="ref-pnum">visiting</span> relatives in Buenos Aires. Meir was asked to come to Bar Gloria on Bartolome Mitre Avenue, where two men were waiting for him: Isser and Dr. Elian. Isser instructed him: “When you return to your relatives’ home, call a doctor and tell him that you were in a car accident, and that you are suffering from dizziness, nausea, and general weakness. The doctor will <a id="pagebreak-rw_81"></a>likely conclude that you are suffering from a concussion and will put you in a hospital. On May 19, in the morning, you’ll tell him that you feel much better and you’ll ask to go home. You’ll be discharged and the hospital will provide you with a document certifying you have been treated for a concussion.”</p><p id="p397" class="text-indent">Dr. Elian then briefed Meir on the specific concussion symptoms that he should present.</p><p id="p398" class="text-indent">Meir left Bar Gloria and followed Isser’s instructions. He lay there and moaned for three days in a big Buenos Aires hospital. On May 19, he was discharged. An hour later, Isser held in his hands an official hospital <span class="ref-pnum">document</span> issued to Meir Bar-Hon, certifying that he had been discharged after being hurt in a car accident.</p><p id="p399" class="text-indent">So, if the plan to smuggle Eichmann out of Argentina as an El Al crew member were to fail, Isser would have him put on a stretcher and carried to the plane as Meir Bar-Hon, a patient still suffering from a serious concussion.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line14"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara33">May 19.</p><p id="p400" class="text-indent">That afternoon the El Al plane landed in Buenos Aires. Protocol officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, enthusiastic local Jews, and children carrying little blue-and-white flags stood on both sides of the red carpet laid by the gangway.</p><p id="p401" class="text-indent">A couple of hours later, Isser conferred with the pilot, Zvi Tohar, and an El Al executive and fixed the takeoff time: May 20, at midnight.</p><p id="p402" class="text-indent">Isser presented his plans. After a short discussion they agreed to go for plan A: Eichmann would be brought aboard as a crew member who had been taken ill. His double, Yehuda Carmel, had already turned over his uniform and documents in the name of Ze’ev Zichroni, an El Al navigator, to the Mossad team. Shalom Danny, the team’s master forger, doctored the documents so as to fit Eichmann perfectly. Carmel was given new <span class="ref-pnum">documents</span> and told that he would leave Argentina sometime soon.</p><p id="p403" class="text-indent">That evening a beehive of activity took over “the Base.” After a week of strained waiting, the Mossad agents sprang back to life. Eichmann was drugged and fell asleep. The agents meticulously stripped the house. The <a id="pagebreak-rw_82"></a>various instruments and devices were all disassembled, the personal <span class="ref-pnum">effects</span> packed, and the house fully restored to its previous state. By the early hours nothing remained that could even hint at the role the villa had played in the last eight days. And similar actions took place in all the other safe houses.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line15"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara34">May 20.</p><p id="p404" class="text-indent">Isser left his hotel for the last time, hailed a cab to the railroad station, and checked his luggage. Then he resumed his café routine of the previous days. The El Al people were the first to report to him, and together they prepared a detailed timetable.</p><p id="p405" class="text-indent">At midday the final stage began. Isser paid his check at the final café he visited, picked up his luggage, and drove to the airport to oversee the <span class="ref-pnum">escape</span> operation. He walked through the terminal, looking for a place where he could best set up his command post. He wandered through the <span class="ref-pnum">shopping</span> and ticketing areas, and finally discovered the cafeteria for airport <span class="ref-pnum">employees</span>. Outside it was bitterly cold and the cafeteria teemed with clerks, ground crew, and flight personnel, who all came in for a hot drink or a light meal. Isser was delighted. This was ideal. Nobody would notice him or become aware of his hurried and hushed consultations with his men. Isser waited until a chair was vacated, and from that position he now began to supervise the final moves on Argentinean soil.</p><h2 id="h210" class="calibre9">“HI, EL AL!”</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara35">9:00 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—In the safe house, all was ready. Eichmann was washed, shaved, dressed in an El Al uniform, and had in his pocket an ID in the name of Ze’ev Zichroni. His face was so well made up that even his own son wouldn’t have recognized him. The doctor and two agents were also in El Al uniforms. The doctor injected Eichmann with a drug that didn’t put him to sleep but only blurred his senses. He was able to hear and see and even walk, but he couldn’t speak and didn’t quite understand what was happening.</p><p id="p406" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_83"></a>Aharoni, also wearing an El Al uniform, took the wheel of the car, and an agent sat beside him. Eichmann was put in the backseat, between the doctor and another Mossad agent. The car set out.</p><p id="p407" class="text-indent">At the same time two other cars departed from a popular hotel in the city center. These cars carried the real El Al crew. Their trip to the airport was meticulously synchronized with the progress of the Mossad vehicles.</p><p id="p408" class="text-indent">In his improvised command post, Isser received minute-by-minute <span class="ref-pnum">updates</span>. He ordered his men’s baggage to be brought to the airport. He had prepared individual escape routes for each one, but if the main plan <span class="ref-pnum">proceeded</span> smoothly, they would all leave Argentina on the El Al aircraft. Not far from Isser, Shalom Danny was sipping from a steaming mug of black coffee. Passersby had no idea that this customer had a lot of cheek: he had set up his forgery lab under their very eyes, and was busy doctoring the passports of the Mossad agents, putting in all the necessary stamps and inscriptions to allow for their easy departure.</p><p id="p409" class="text-indent">11:00 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—A man materialized next to Isser. All the cars, Mossad, and El Al had arrived, he reported. Isser hurried to the parking lot and checked the El Al cars. The crew members were silent. They sensed that they were participating in something extraordinary, but had no idea what it was. They listened to Isser’s instructions quietly and asked no questions. Isser looked inside the third car, where Eichmann was dozing between his <span class="ref-pnum">escorts</span>. “Go,” he said. “Good luck!”</p><p id="p410" class="text-indent">The three cars moved ahead, while Isser returned to the terminal. The convoy reached the Argentinean Airlines barrier; the Israeli aircraft was parked in their lot. “Hi, El Al!”—one of the Israelis merrily called. The guards recognized him and were, in fact, used to the Israelis going in and out of their lot all day. They cast a weary look at the passengers in the three vehicles, all dressed in El Al uniforms. In two of the cars, the passengers were singing, laughing, and loudly chatting, while those in the third car were asleep in their seats.</p><p id="p411" class="text-indent">The barrier was raised and all three cars drove toward the plane. Their doors opened and the dozen or so uniformed men moved in a cluster toward the gangway. Eichmann trudged along in the middle, largely <a id="pagebreak-rw_84"></a>concealed by the others. Two men held him, helped him up the stairs, and placed him by a window in first class. The doctor and the security team spread out on the seats around him and pretended to be asleep. If <span class="ref-pnum">Argentinean</span> immigration officers were to come and check their papers, they were to be told that these are the men who work the second shift, and need to rest before the next leg of the flight.</p><p id="p412" class="text-indent">11:15 <span class="smallcaps">P.M.</span>—Isser, back in his seat at the cafeteria, heard the <span class="ref-pnum">characteristic</span> rumbling of the “Whispering Giant”’s engines. The plane taxied to the terminal and stopped at its departure gate. Isser walked swiftly to the <span class="ref-pnum">Departure</span> Hall and looked around. In odd corners he saw his men, standing beside their luggage. Isser walked around to them, and as he approached each of the agents, he whispered: “Get on the plane.” They moved casually and joined the line to passport control. All had their passports ready. And Shalom Danny had done a fine job with them.</p><p id="p413" class="text-indent">11:45 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—Having passed immigration and customs without any <span class="ref-pnum">problems</span>, the group went through the departure gate and walked toward the plane. Isser was the last to pick up his luggage, go through the checkpoints, and get on the plane, which almost immediately moved out onto the runway.</p><p id="p414" class="text-indent">0:00 hours; the night between May 20 and 21. The plane stopped. A delay was ordered by the control tower. The agents were all tense with <span class="ref-pnum">anxiety</span>. Had something happened? Had a last-minute tip reached the <span class="ref-pnum">Argentinean</span> police? Would they be ordered to turn back? But after a few minutes of terrifying anxiety, the plane was finally cleared. The “Whispering Giant” took off over the silvery waters of Rio de la Plata. Isser breathed a sigh of relief.</p><h2 id="h211" class="calibre9">“I HAVE TO INFORM THE KNESSET…”</h2><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara36">May 22. The plane landed at Lod Airport early in the morning.</p><p id="p415" class="text-indent">At nine fifty <span class="smallcaps">A.M</span>. Isser came directly to Jerusalem. Ben-Gurion’s <span class="ref-pnum">secretary</span>, Yitzhak Navon, immediately ushered him into the prime minister’s office.</p><p id="p416" class="text-indent">Ben-Gurion was surprised. “When did you arrive?”</p><p id="p417" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_85"></a>“Two hours ago. We got Eichmann.”</p><p id="p418" class="text-indent">“Where is he?” the Old Man asked.</p><p id="p419" class="text-indent">“Here, in Israel. Adolf Eichmann is in Israel, and if you agree, we’ll <span class="ref-pnum">deliver</span> him to the police right away.”</p><p id="p420" class="text-indent">Ben-Gurion fell silent. He didn’t burst into tears, as some journalists later reported, nor did he laugh triumphantly, as others wrote. He didn’t hug Isser, or show any emotion.</p><p id="p421" class="text-indent">“Are you sure that this is Eichmann?” he asked. “How did you <span class="ref-pnum">identify</span> him?”</p><p id="p422" class="text-indent">Isser, surprised, answered yes. He detailed for Ben-Gurion all the <span class="ref-pnum">criteria</span> by which Eichmann had been identified, and stressed that the prisoner himself had admitted that he was Adolf Eichmann. But the Old Man was not entirely satisfied. Not enough, he said. Before he would authorize any further steps, he wanted one or two people who had known Eichmann to meet him and formally identify him. He needed to be one hundred percent sure, and he wouldn’t say a word about this to his government until then.</p><p id="p423" class="text-indent">Isser called his office and ordered his staff to find some people who could identify Eichmann personally. In no time, they located two Israelis who in the past had met Eichmann. They were brought to the cell where he was being held, spoke with him, and formally identified him.</p><p id="p424" class="text-indent">At midday, an Israeli envoy burst into a restaurant in Frankfurt and rushed to one of the tables, where a white-haired man, visibly nervous, sat alone. “Herr Bauer,” he said, “Adolf Eichmann is now in our hands. Our men have captured him and brought him to Israel. At any moment we can expect a statement in the Knesset by the prime minister.”</p><p id="p425" class="text-indent">Bauer, pale and deeply moved, got up. His hands were trembling. The man who had given Mossad Eichmann’s address in Argentina, the man without whom Eichmann would likely have never been caught, couldn’t <span class="ref-pnum">restrain</span> himself anymore. He burst into tears, grasped the Israeli’s shoulder, hugged him, and kissed him.</p><p id="p426" class="text-indent">4:00 <span class="smallcaps">P.M</span>.—At the Knesset plenary session, Ben-Gurion took the <span class="ref-pnum">speaker</span>’s podium. In a firm, clear voice, he read a short statement: “I have to inform the Knesset that the security services of Israel have just recently <a id="pagebreak-rw_86"></a>laid hands on one of the greatest of Nazi criminals, Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible with other Nazi leaders for what they called ‘the final solution,’ that is to say the extermination of six million European Jews. Eichmann is at present under arrest here in Israel. He will soon be put on trial in Israel, in accordance with the law on the crimes of the Nazis and their collaborators.”</p><p id="p427" class="text-indent">Ben-Gurion’s words were received with shock and wonder, which turned into huge, spontaneous applause. Amazement and admiration spread through the Knesset and throughout the world. At the end of the Knesset session, a man got up from his seat, behind the government bench. Few knew his face or his name. It was Isser Harel.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line16"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara37">The trial of Adolf Eichmann opened in Jerusalem on April 11, 1961. One hundred and ten Holocaust survivors were the witnesses for the <span class="ref-pnum">prosecution</span>. Some had never before spoken of their past, and now told their <span class="ref-pnum">horrendous</span> stories. It was as if the entire State of Israel was glued to the radio and followed with great pain and horror the dreadful story that emerged from the testimonies. And it felt as if the entire Jewish people identified with the prosecutor, Gideon Hausner, who confronted the Nazi criminal as the representative of his six million victims.</p><p id="p428" class="text-indent">On December 15, 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death. His appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court, and pardon was refused by President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. On May 31, 1962, Adolf Eichmann was informed that his end was imminent. In his cell, the condemned man wrote a few letters to his family and drank half a bottle of red Carmel wine. Toward midnight, the Reverend Hull, a Nonconformist minister, entered Eichmann’s cell, as he had on previous occasions. “Tonight I shall not discuss the Bible with you,” Eichmann said to him. “I have no time to lose.”</p><p id="p429" class="text-indent">The minister left, but then an unexpected visitor walked into <span class="ref-pnum">Eichmann</span>’s cell. Rafi Eitan.</p><p id="p430" class="text-indent">The abductor stood facing the condemned man, dressed in a prisoner’s light brown uniform. Eitan said nothing. Eichmann looked at him, and said in German: “I hope that your turn will come after mine.”</p><p id="p431" class="text-indent"><a id="pagebreak-rw_87"></a>The guards led Eichmann to a tiny room that had been converted to an execution chamber. He was placed on a trapdoor and a noose was slipped over his neck. A small group of officials, journalists, and a doctor, all <span class="ref-pnum">allowed</span> to be present at the execution, heard his last words, spoken in the Nazi tradition: “We’ll meet again … I have lived, believing in God … I obeyed the laws of war and was loyal to my flag …”</p><p id="p432" class="text-indent">Two police officers behind a screen simultaneously pressed two <span class="ref-pnum">buttons</span>, only one of which worked the trapdoor. Neither knew who had the controlling button, so the name of Eichmann’s executioner remains <span class="ref-pnum">unknown</span>. Eitan didn’t see the actual execution, but heard the thud of the trapdoor.</p><p id="p433" class="text-indent">Eichmann’s body was incinerated in an aluminum oven in the prison courtyard. “Black smoke rose toward the sky,” wrote an American reporter. “No one said a word, but it was impossible not to recall the crematoriums at Auschwitz …”</p><p id="p434" class="text-indent">Shortly before dawn on June 1, 1962, a swift boat of Israel’s coast guard passed beyond Israel’s territorial waters. The engine was turned off, and while the boat drifted silently a police officer cast Eichmann’s ashes into the Mediterranean.</p><p id="p435" class="text-indent">The wind and the waves dispersed the remains of the man who twenty years earlier had merrily declared: “I’ll jump laughing into the grave, happy at having exterminated six million Jews.”</p><p id="p436" class="text-indent">At the deathbed of his mother, Zvi Malkin thought of his massacred relatives, of his sister Fruma and her small children, perished in the <span class="ref-pnum">Holocaust</span>. He bent toward his mother and whispered to her: “Mother, I got Eichmann. Fruma is avenged.”</p><p id="p437" class="text-indent">“I knew you wouldn’t forget your sister,” the dying woman whispered.</p></div>
