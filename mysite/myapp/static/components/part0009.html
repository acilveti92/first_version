				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The British officer gripped the window frame tightly as the dak gharry lurched and scrabbled its way closer to the city of Bhundapur. He held fast until the wild pitching ceased, the action instinctive after so long incarcerated in a seemingly never-ending procession of carriages, palkis and dolis. His exhausting journey had taken weeks, and now, as he finally neared his destination, the officer felt the stirring of unease deep in his gut.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He tugged nervously on the hem of his scarlet shell jacket with the green facings of his new regiment before running his hand over his unfashionably short hair. He had dressed at the caravanserai where he had spent the night. Unlike so many of the British officers he eschewed any form of facial hair and that morning he had shaved closely, meticulous in his preparation, the ritual of preparing for the day ahead deeply ingrained. Now he was anxious that he looked travel-worn and unkempt, so he brushed at his uniform, doing his best to straighten out the inevitable creases and remove the most obvious specks of dirt.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He was reaching the end of the last leg of a journey that had started far away on the Crimean peninsula. Months of travel had led to this moment, to the last hours before he caught up with his fate. He patted the pocket of his scarlet coat, checking for the umpteenth time that his documents were still in place. They had brought him this far. The next few hours would tell if they would see him safely ensconced in his new home and in his place as a commissioned officer in one Her Majesty’s regiments.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The precious papers, now creased and worn, named the officer as Captain James Danbury of Her Majesty’s 24th Regiment of Foot. A captain was a man of station and importance. One who would be expected to take his place in the British establishment that ruled a land so far from home.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The 24th’s newest officer sat back amidst the cushions and pillows of the dak and thought on what he knew of his new command. The 24th was a regular army regiment. It was stationed in India to bolster the forces of the East India Company, the mercantile company that administered and ruled the country in the name of the Queen. The East India Company ostensibly borrowed, and paid for, the regular troops who were spread amongst the three presidencies into which the country was divided.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Each presidency boasted its own army. The bulk of each force was made up of native infantry regiments composed of locally recruited soldiers, led by British officers. Alongside these native regiments were a number of European infantry battalions, whose ranks were filled by British and Irish recruits. The officers of both held commissions granted by the East India Company, rather than by the Queen. It led to a social distinction between the Queen’s officers in the regular army regiments, and those only holding a commission granted by the EIC. The officer had only been in the country for a few short weeks, but already he had learnt that snobbery was rife, the intricate layers of society guarded with a diligence and a jealousy that would shock even the snootiest London matriarch.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The man possessing the papers of Captain Danbury would take his place in the 24th’s hierarchy, assuming command of a company of redcoats. It was a precious responsibility, but not one with which he was unfamiliar. He had commanded a company in the Crimea, at the tumultuous battle at the Alma River. There he had learnt what it truly meant to lead men, the responsibility that came with the shiny gold buttons and being called ‘sir’. Being an officer was a position that few deserved and even fewer earned. Yet the man in the dak gharry had travelled thousands of miles for the opportunity to once again command the men so cruelly titled ‘the scum of the earth’, risking his life for the sake of a tattered parchment and the power it ordained. For Captain James Danbury was dead. His name, identity and uniform now belonged to Jack Lark, an impostor, who sat in the lurching dak gharry, his guts screwed tight with tension as he anxiously waited to discover if his newest identity would pass muster, or if he was simply being transported to denunciation and a cold, lonely dawn on the scaffold.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack cursed as the dak lurched, forcing him to grab at the seat opposite to avoid being thrown into an undignified heap on the floor. As he recovered his poise, he saw a small, dark-faced child capering in the scrubby field beside the road, clearly entranced by an imaginary game. Jack smiled as he watched the boy at play, envying him his freedom.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He looked past the boy, his attention taken by a forbidding tower on the skyline. It dominated the small village that clustered around its skirts, casting a long shadow across the sorry collection of drab mud and thatch houses. The tower was battered, a relic of a distant past. Yet there was a dignity to it, a grace that belied the pockmarked walls and broken stone. It had endured through the centuries, its lonely vigil immune to the machinations of men. It was a symbol of what had been, and Jack shivered as an uneasy chill ran down his spine. He hid his own past away, refusing to dwell on the dark memories that lurked in the corners of his mind, and forced himself to think of what was to come. He had journeyed far, chasing a future that was not his own. He was fast approaching the time when he would confront it and discover his fate.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Sujan saw the tiger, yet he felt no fear. The huge beast crept through the thick grass and would have passed by unnoticed were it not for the warrior who guarded his family’s goats so diligently.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Only the bravest could take up their spear and move silently towards the mighty hunter, whose power terrified lesser men, men who would run screaming in fear at the merest glimpse of his shadow. Sujan hefted his weapon, feeling the balance in its beautifully crafted shaft. The weight was reassuring in his hand, and his fingers curled around the lovingly polished wood, his fingertips caressing the intricate carvings that had taken the best craftsmen in the village days of toil to create. Slowly, patiently, he eased his way to where the huge animal had stopped, its mouth open as it tasted the air. He took no chances as he manoeuvred stealthily to free up a clean shot for his spear, taking his time, his eyes never leaving his target.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Then the tiger saw him, and roared.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A weaker man would have fled, his precious goats left for the beast to devour. Yet Sujan rose fearlessly from his haunches, his muscles stretched tight as he pulled back his arm. With every ounce of his strength he flung his spear at the huge animal, an involuntary grunt forced from his lips. Driven by a skill only the mightiest of warriors possessed, the spear exploded through the grasses, the razor-sharp tip at its point tearing through the tiger’s powerful body, embedding itself in the animal’s heart, killing the fearful beast in an instant.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Seeing his foe struck down, Sujan leapt to his feet, his arms flung wide in celebration, his face creased in a triumphant scowl, his voice screeching in delight. The high-pitched wail scared an ancient vulture into reluctant flight from where it had watched the contest from a nearby rock, the sudden movement silencing the hero’s wild roars of victory.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Sujan walked forward, bending low to retrieve the thin, splintered stick, the only weapon his grandfather trusted him with to guard the ten flea-bitten goats in the family herd. With his hand scratching busily under his langoti, Sujan turned his back on the boulder he had slain. The fearsome tiger was nothing more dangerous than a moss-covered rock that had taken the small boy’s fancy as he idled away the long afternoon waiting for his grandfather to appear to help him drive the meagre herd back to their home on the far side of the village. At seven, Sujan was left alone for most of the day with just the sinewy goats for company and his eager imagination for entertainment.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The small boy pulled aside his loincloth, carelessly emptying his bladder into a thorny bush as he tried to conjure up another game to while away the lonely tedium of another hour. He looked around sharply as he heard the sound of a dak, his thin stream of urine meandering across the dusty soil as he turned.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His face twisted with hatred as he saw the dak gharry bouncing its way along the trunk road to Bhundapur. He caught a glimpse of a white face staring in his direction – another firangi officer on his way to join the foreigners’ camp outside the city. The officer lifted a hand in greeting, his cold grey stare disconcerting even from a distance.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Sujan turned away, spitting into the dust, just as his grandfather did whenever he talked of the pale firangi who had come from the cold lands to rule over them. Sujan did not understand why men like his grandfather had allowed the foreigners to take control of their country, but he had learnt not to ask. He was cuffed around the head too often enough already. At least the white men and their fat women were good for the village. They came in small parties to stare at the tower, the loud, red-faced men and their shrieking, brazen woman gazing in wonder at the place where the villagers had taken the bodies of their dead relatives since time immemorial. The firangi were easy prey for the sharp-minded locals, who charged an extortionate fee for their meagre offering of hospitality and grew fat on the money. No other village in the valley could hope to match their wealth.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Sujan finished pissing and went back to his goats, yelling at one that was drifting too far on its tireless quest to find food. He looked at the sky and saw that it would be hours yet until his grandfather returned, so he closed his eyes and tried to conjure the image of a wandering vagabond, an interesting challenge for the warrior who was charged with defending his family’s precious herd.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He opened his eyes as he heard the sound of movement. He expected to see another dak on its long journey to the British cantonment at Bhundapur, but his eyes widened in horror as instead he saw his imagination given life, though he had never conceived of a horde such as the one that had appeared over the crest of the ridge to the south of the village. Forgetting his goats and the duty his grandfather had beaten into him since he had first learnt to walk, the boy ran.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">For the wild men had come down from the hills. The bandits, the dacoits and the thugs. The landless men. The bitter and the disappointed. The unloved and the unwanted.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">They came in a mob, a wave of hatred that washed across the dusty ground, smothering the sun-bleached soil with fear. The villagers watched in horror as the end of their precious existence arrived, their wealth and pride the bait that had lured the monster from out of the darkness. The silent tower now set to bear witness to the bandits’ desire for vengeance on those who had condemned them to the bitter life of the banished.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">They were led by the one they called the Tiger. Some said he was not a man at all, but a god, or a prince of the darkness that shrouded the godless. No mortal man could stand against him. Those that tried were killed. Struck down by his merciless hand or by his word, a curse from the lips of the Tiger certain to bring only lingering agony followed by death.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Yet men flocked to his banner, intent on theft, on rape and on revenge on the world that had forgotten them. The Tiger offered them all a home. A sanctuary. Uniting them in hatred against the Maharajah of Sawadh, who had condemned them to their loveless fate and who ruled their land with an iron rod. Men found guilty of any crime were sentenced to mutilation, death or banishment, the living death that was so much more painful than a swift beheading or precise strangulation.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Now the Maharajah had learnt of their band. He had pledged their annihilation, his honour stained by their very being. So the bandits lived a life of fear, always moving on, never staying in one place for too long as they tried to outrun the retribution that was sure to find them. The village and its precious tower would offer them rich pickings, providing food and shelter for a week, perhaps two. They would strip it bare, using its people and feeding on its abundant supplies before they moved on to the next place. They did not fear the tower or its white-robed priests. The Tiger and his men had long left behind the superstitious world of religion and its many and various gods.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Their souls were already lost, and they swept through the village like a plague.</p>
