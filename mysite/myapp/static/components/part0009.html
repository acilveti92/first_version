			<div class="calibre1"></div><p id="_idParaDest-9" class="ct3"><a id="_idTextAnchor002" class="calibre3"></a>The Adventure of <br class="calibre4"/>the Magical Menagerie</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">It has long been a dictum of my internationally celebrated friend Sherlock Holmes that work is the best antidote to sorrow. As his biographer, therefore, I have been given occasion to wonder whether the almost superhuman effort he himself expends over his cases is relevant to this credo. When at work, he is an indefatigable automaton: dashing hither and thither consulting all relevant parties, weighing the value of data to hand provided by the police, and more often discovering clues everyone else has overlooked. When idle, however, he is a listless creature, hollow-eyed to a degree which ever causes me the deepest sympathetic consternation.</p>
			<p class="bt">Perhaps the maxim and the man have no literal relation to one another. Holmes has many times accused me of owning too poetic a nature for my own good; were I to broach the subject with him, howsoever obliquely, he would lift an icy brow while inquiring whether I was not a trifle feverish and suggesting I lie down. And yet, so mournful does he appear when inactive that I shall never rule out the possibility of some tragedy having befallen my friend. It remains to be seen whether he shall ever give his tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak, as it were, but I can state with personal assurance that his adage is wisdom and, on March the 15th of 1897, he proved it to me.</p>
			<p class="bt">As was usual during that season, I had a letter from Mrs. Cecil Forrester, a former client of my friend but, far more important, the former employer of my late wife. Mary had for years worked as a governess before we wed, and had been far better disposed to that difficult work than some, for her nature was so tender and gentle that even the most colicky newborn would settle into her arms and coo like a dove.</p>
			<p class="bt">This facility of hers had been treated by the Forrester household not with cold approval but with heartfelt affection, particularly by the wife, who called Mary her “darling girl” and shared every intimacy of cohabitation and companionship with her. The two had remained devoted to each other even after our wedding separated them geographically, just as I continued to join in adventures with my vastly more eccentric friend, and Mrs. Forrester each March since 1894 had written me a heartfelt missive suggesting that if I ever needed an audience for my reminiscences, she would prove not only a devoted listener but a willing participant. It was typical of Mary’s closest friend that she should not abandon me following our shared bitter loss, and whenever in Mrs. Forrester’s company, I thought with warmth how glad I was that Mary may have been poor when we met save for the mysterious pearls that were her inheritance, but nevertheless was perfectly comfortable in her situation.</p>
			<p class="bt">Unfortunately, Mrs. Forrester’s well-intentioned overture ever filled me with harrowing dread of our postman, Mr. McPhail (who deserved no such sentiment, as he was a florid, jolly fellow with four children and a fifth on the way). When the letter addressed in her handwriting arrived I was alone at Baker Street with a vexing case of catarrh—still in my dressing gown, my chin and hair in a pitiable state, all my handkerchiefs soiled, staring at untouched toast and the film of white clouds pasted over the sky beyond our window. On the two other occasions when I had received this apparently annual correspondence, Holmes and I had both been from home; since his miraculous return, he had been the most sought-after man by the police and the most loathed by the underworld in the history of England, and I had been at his side all the while.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes, however, had gone to consult with his brother Mycroft over some abstruse encoding work at Whitehall regarding which he could tell me nothing whatsoever; I was alone. I was, in addition, irrationally petulant over the fact. It would be the basest self-flattery to suggest that this was due to mere illness, for I am no stranger to physical hardship. The sea of melancholy in which I was floating had soaked me to the bone. By the time I heard my fellow lodger’s brisk step upon the stair and his lean form had burst into the room, scattering his beloved latest editions as if he were a potentate showering the masses with gold, the skies beyond the window had darkened to the somber bluish coal of twilight’s end, and the fire had died untimely. I was spread lengthwise upon the settee patently doing nothing whatsoever, to my own considerable disgust.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes whistled, his grey eyes pinned to one of the newspapers. “Dear me. A fiver says you and I will be called to the Norfolk coast over this business of the Viking manuscript, Watson. A complete eleventh-century ballad cycle discovered just when the Earl is rumored to be selling half his securities? The mind balks at such felicitous coincidences. At least the barometer suggests we’ll have no difficulty in traveling there. The nine-twenty-three express from Charing Cross ought to do nicely, though I suppose there is no use in getting an early start when I don’t yet know which party involved will inevitably consult me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I merely coughed, he glanced up, taking in the scene with his usual lightning precision. Admittedly, genius was not required to create a narrative from the rapidly dimming room, the dismal condition of the fire I had neglected, the supply of kerchiefs, my own state of undress, and the letter which I had slid unopened onto the mantel so that I might glare at it unreservedly. As Holmes himself would put it, the greenest C Division constable would have solved the mystery quick as blinking.</p>
			<p class="bt">My life is one of perpetual surprises. Whatever I had expected to happen next, I did not expect Sherlock Holmes to tilt his chiseled features as if in thought, slap the newspaper against his hand, drop it with its brethren upon the rug, and quit the room.</p>
			<p class="bt">When I heard his bedroom door shut, I confess my already hunched shoulders slumped fully into the cushions. The combination of sorrow, sickness, and idleness had already so depressed my spirits that this latest development suggested I give the entire day up as lost and hope for an improved tomorrow. By the time I had determined to do just that, however, Holmes was back, now clad in his blue dressing gown, with its ties valiantly fluttering as he announced, “I will not tolerate this sort of abuse.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My bleary eyes widened to saucers as he briskly opened the scuttle and stoked up the blaze. That task finished, he donned his slippers and whirled about seeing to various lamps until our parlor glowed as yellow as the inside of an egg.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What abuse might that be?” I rasped incredulously.</p>
			<p class="bt">Guilty as I already felt over my own black humor, I supposed that he meant the dark, chilly, and altogether inhospitable atmosphere to which I had subjected him. Instead of answering, however, he flung himself out of the room with fully as much alacrity as he applies to unidentified footmarks.</p>
			<p class="bt">This rankled tremendously. However insalubrious Holmes found Baker Street that day, surely I found it trebly worse. I was about to quit the sofa in favor of demanding satisfaction of my friend when he returned bearing the ever-tantalizing tin box which houses reports of his earliest cases. This he dropped to the floor so disgustedly that Mrs. Hudson must have supposed the sky was falling.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It absolutely will not do, Watson,” Holmes declared imperiously. An instant later he had sunk neatly behind the box, in one fluid movement crossing his legs as if he were a Buddha presiding over a temple. “Even men whose time is of less value than my own prefer to be engaged upon work related to their actual vocations—one does not enlist the secretarial services of costermongers or the nautical skills of ornithologists. Speaking directly to this principle: I am a consulting detective, not a secretary for a third-rate shipping concern.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I regarded him in no little awe. “What on earth are you on about?”</p>
			<p class="bt">His hand waved in an impatient spiral before lifting the box lid. “Athelney Jones has lost the paperwork regarding a shared case. Naturally he has. The man ought to be daily congratulated for selecting the correct left and right boots for his respective feet. Now he needs to write a secondary report, and of course, <span class="charoverride3">I </span>could tell you at once that the business hinged entirely upon the fellow’s having had a twin brother in the diamond cutting business, but surely you’ll agree Inspector Jones owns considerably more energy than acumen.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When once Sherlock Holmes has embarked upon his tirades, those not enthralled despite their customary verve and nuance could no more stop them than they could a charging elephant. My money, in fact, should be upon the gargantuan mammal’s being felled long before my friend wearied of invective. I watched as he rummaged through the box whilst muttering in his rapid tenor, “Pointless waste of a perfectly pleasant evening. Is it to be my job to file the Yarders’ paperwork now, after solving their cases for them? That was Gregson . . . this one Hollingberry . . . Heavens, Doctor, but we spend a great deal of our lives with Lestrade. . . . Ha, Jones!” His face fell immediately, however. “Confound it, this is a Jones case to be sure, but it’s one from before your time which introduced me to Old Mr. Sherman. Come to think of it, the matter must hold some interest for you—you surely remember Sherman’s dog Toby, from the business of Jonathan Small and the Morstan treasure.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s steely eyes swept up to mine. “Should you like me to recount the case for you? Supposing you’re not too done in.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I realized precisely what my friend had just orchestrated, I confess I was forced to clear my throat for reasons other than illness. He knew all about poor Mrs. Forrester’s yearly letter commiserating over Mary’s—née<span class="charoverride3"> </span>Morstan’s—passing; in one fell swoop, he not only had said in his peculiar sideways fashion that he knew why I was so low, but had offered an obvious way to honor my late spouse without any maudlin sentiment entering the picture, nor any work on my part other than to sit back and listen.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are altogether extraordinary,” was my answer when I could speak.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes formed a sudden acute interest in the mantel clock. “If you prefer—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should prefer nothing more in the world! Let us hear it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Still he hesitated, uncharacteristically doubtful of his own scheme. “It’s not too late to make it to Covent Garden if you dress quickly, and <span class="charoverride3">Aïda</span> is supposedly—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Heavens no—my nerves are as tight as your fiddle strings and my bones ache whenever I shift a muscle. Bring me a little brandy and lemon if you would, and tell me how you came to meet that remarkable Sherman fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Wordlessly, though his brow cleared, Holmes hopped to his feet and took his time in procuring a pair of toddies. I was quite myself again when he returned, settling on a cushion with his back to the sofa and his long legs stretched before him as he flipped through the case file.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, then. I have mentioned,” said he whilst lighting his pipe, “that in the period before I found myself possessed of a biographer to trumpet my name, I spent much of my time in the British Museum. They were good days, but they were, as was quite usual for me, rather solitary and desultory. You know that, saving yourself, I have no knack for camaraderie, but far more vexing was the fact I had no template of consulting detectives before me so that I might follow their course of study. It was a pretty conundrum which went hand in glove with inventing my own profession. You see, I’d no idea what sort of information would prove essential in future. Anyone who observed me there might have told you I was an intellectual wastrel, or else a helpless idiot, for I skipped from topic to topic like a butterfly, memorizing mammalian footmarks and types of rope and the Thames’s tidal schedule. I often wearied of being cooped up indoors, and that is when I hit upon creating a comprehensive mental map of London’s streets.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I perennially wonder how you formed one in the first place, let alone keep it up to date.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The detective’s eyes twinkled mischievously. “If you prefer that I learn the solar system . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good Lord, no. We should have perished several times over if not for your knowledge of winding little crevices. Pray go on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I was memorizing Lambeth in April.” My friend’s voice had grown almost wistful; he has an iron nature, but if there is one subject upon which he speaks romantically, other than music, it is London, for he adores the place. “The sawyers’ mills, the barges bobbing on the bloated river, the stately pleasure gardens, Westminster Palace looming across the water. I had good reason to focus upon that area. According to the papers, a disproportionate number of robberies had taken place there recently and, as a fledgling investigator, I wanted a look at the houses which had been targeted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I walked past each in turn—Union Road, Larkhall Lane, Gaskell Street. They were quite innocuous dwellings, with freshly doused steps and budding flowers in the window boxes, modestly well-off but far from wealthy. Noting the dearth of scratches around the door locks, I inferred that the cracksmen involved were far from inexperienced. But this seemed a futile enough lead, and I had no pretext to offer the residents when requesting an interview. It was trying, Watson. Save for the fact I felt about these crime scenes as a child would staring at sweets through a window, I could do nothing but play the gawking loafer.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A part which has availed you well since, at the least.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“True enough. Just a moment. You know how I loathe dining on Tuesdays—ought I tell Mrs. Hudson it shall be hot soup for you at eight? Capital. Anyhow, I had moved along and canvassed most of Vauxhall when I arrived at the queer address to which I sent you for Toby. The road was Pinchin Lane, and the most extraordinary commotion was occurring outside number three.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘You daren’t cross us, Tom Sherman! Let us in!’ a great brute of a fellow boomed as he shook his fist at the dingy red brick building. A little ginger-headed chap huddled close by, and something about him seemed equally menacing even as he cringed. The pair of them appeared coarse and cruel in a way that the merely impoverished never do despite all of them being customarily clad in the same rough wool and thick-soled boots.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘This ’ere wiper says you’ll not cross me neither!’ the resident of the first floor shrieked from above, waving a brown burlap sack in his fist. ‘This wiper is a particular friend o’ mine, d’ye hear me? None closer! He’s as good as me brother! And he’ll be biting the pair o’ you in the face if you don’t shove off. I’ll drop ’im on yer pates quick as blinking!”</p>
			<p class="bt">Laughing heartily at my friend’s mimicry skills, I took a sip of hot brandy and lemon. The fire crackled nicely by now, and—owing to the fact that Sherlock Holmes almost never bothers with such mundane activities as lighting all the lamps—the room seemed in its subtle difference of illumination to have an almost theatrically homelike effect. I settled farther back into my nest of cushions and adjusted the afghan over my legs.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Old Sherman and his bag of ‘wipers,’ ” I reflected. “I remember it as if I’d met him yesterday.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Piquant, is it not?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Decidedly. I’d never seen such a display in my life.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll admit that when I sent you to him, knowing your spirit of adventure as I do, I hoped you’d be treated to the usual performance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very kind of you. Although when he threatened to throw serpents on my head, he at least did me the gentlemanly courtesy of offering to first count to three,” I added, chuckling.</p>
			<p class="bt">“<span class="charoverride3">You </span>may well laugh, my dear Watson,” Holmes returned with feigned asperity. “<span class="charoverride3">You</span> had my name to offer as a password. Here <span class="charoverride3">I</span> was, an aspiring detective stumbling upon a live housebreaking. Were I to walk away, I should never regain my confidence. Were I to approach, vipers would fall from the very heavens.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend Sherlock Holmes, who pretends to fear nothing between Southwark and the Sahara, almost visibly cringes at the mere mention of snakes. He reserves the word itself for the most vile of epithets directed at the most degraded of criminals. On the unforgettable occasion when we kept vigil at Stoke Moran, I quite feared that the strain before he finally glimpsed the swamp adder would do him permanent mental harm. When he did spy the venomous creature, he lashed at it as if a demon had been loosed from Hell itself and he were trying to drive it back again. I would twit him over this quirk, but, as it is endearingly uncharacteristic, I instead keep my peace.</p>
			<p class="bt">I observed, “Of course you approached them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes tapped his pipe stem against his prominent chin as he smiled at the memory. “Naturally. It was irresistible. The creeping little chap, I soon learned, went by Jack o’ the Devil for his scarlet pate, and the gigantic lout was called Plaid Charlie. So many different plaids never have I seen on a single man at once, Watson—waistcoat, trousers, jacket, tie, all different colors and patterns to boot—and he weighed at least three stone more than I ever have. He also wore a cracked bowler over bushy black side-whiskers, and, when he saw me, he grinned as if happy at the chance of a fresh fight.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘What’s this, then? A toff on the lookout for a free hiding?’ he leered, showing rather less than a perfect roster of teeth.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh, I beg your pardon,’ said I. ‘I merely lacked a plaid undershirt, and wondered whether you might assist me in procuring one.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“As Plaid Charlie’s nostrils flared like a bull’s, I studied my options other than pugilism, and my eyes lit upon Old Tom Sherman hanging out of his window. He’s a gaunt chap, you’ll recall, and seemed composed of sticks and strings, with a much-pleated neck like a leathery curtain and spectacles tinted an eccentric shade of Prussian blue, though his hair back then was a sandy brown color. Then I spied the display upon the lower story and gaped at the taxidermy in various stages of slaughtering one another. The panorama was violent, delirious, like nothing I’d ever imagined. You saw it for yourself—within the dried moss and grasses and tree branches was set a mongoose killing a snake, an owl sinking its claws into a stoat, a ferret carrying a baby rabbit.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, and a hawk snatching up a pretty blue and green lizard of a species I’ve never seen in any museum. It did seem a more exotic ode to Nature’s whims than I should have expected in that oddly whimsical house.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite so.” Sherlock Holmes set his pipe aside on the case file and drew one leg up with his hands clasped around his shin, reminiscing. “Well, I asked myself whether I was a detective or a toff, as Plaid Charlie would have it, and I chose the former, asking Old Sherman his name and why these men were troubling him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘They’re both blackguards, that’s why!’ Sherman howled. ‘Troubling decent folk is a blackguard’s stock in trade, innit now? That there’s Plaid Charlie and Jack o’ the Devil come to do me injury, and I a civilized naturalist defending me ’ome!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh, how cruel to say that!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Jack o’ the Devil finally spoke, removing a filthy beaver hat to reveal more of his fiery hair and an extraordinarily broad smile. I’ve scarce ever encountered such a repulsive individual, Watson, and you will concede that I meet more than my share of that sort. His voice was highly unnerving—a mixture of the pleading and the invidious, grating through his throat—and he bowed repeatedly up and down. He meant the motion to be coaxing, I imagine, but in fact it was intensely disturbing. I was reminded of a wicked marionette with a tuft of red yarn attached to its wooden pate and a queerly wide grin painted across its face, bobbing about a miniature stage.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Don’t even think that, Old Sherman, for all yer old partner wants is a word or two. Don’t break me ’eart so, I beg. ’Tisn’t Christian of ye.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘This man is your partner?’ I called up, attempting not to note how loosely Mr. Sherman held his bag and the prisoner within.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Former partner!’ shrieked the proprietor. ‘The wretch was sacked! The villain was sent packin’ and I meant it to be fer good and all. Watch the wiper, for ’ere she comes!’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend smiled ruefully. “At this juncture, Watson, matters were growing a trifle unfriendly, and nary a constable in sight. As I had been memorizing less than harmonious neighborhoods, I was armed with a weighted stick, and thus I decided that the best course would be to adopt a more forceful manner.”</p>
			<p class="bt">For my own part, I failed to picture Sherlock Holmes as anything less than forceful, but bade him continue.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘You are obviously unwelcome,’ I called out. ‘Be off before I whistle for reinforcements—I am a plainclothes detective inspector, and were I not already engaged, I should have you in darbies.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh ho!’ cried Plaid Charlie. ‘You, a ’tec! And I’m Mary Magdalene!’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As you can imagine, Watson, it was immensely flattering that, even at such an early age, no one could possibly confuse me with a Yard inspector. The memory still gratifies me. But while I thanked him in my heart, I sought to lend my story some credence and nevertheless advanced, my walking stick at the ready.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I’ve business of my own to see to,’ I repeated to Plaid Charlie. ‘However, I observe that, while your attire is sagged at the knees and elbows and your boots are cracking, your cravat is made of fine silk and fastened with a Celtic-patterned gold tiepin matching the description of an item stolen from Exton Street not two days hence. Your cowering companion, despite his similarly shabby togs, is wearing ivory kidskin gloves which I should wager have been worn twice at most, if the cleanliness of the fingertips is any indication. Given the evidence against you, I suggest you bless your maker for a few more days of freedom and get out of my sight.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘What if,’ Plaid Charlie snarled, ‘we thought that snuffing yer lights ’ere and now was a better lay, you scrawny jack?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“At this time, he deemed it best to take a swing at me. I’ve no doubt he could have taken my head clean off, Doctor, save for the fact that I had been studying defensive techniques, and that large brutes often severely underestimate their opponents; for the first time, I congratulated myself on my choice of at least one of my studies, for aptitude with a singlestick proved then and there to have been a prudent selection. A snapping block with the cane followed by a left hook and then a sweep under his leg laid him out in the street. But I knew it could not be for long and glanced back to find Sherman. He stood in the now-unlocked doorway wildly beckoning me to come inside.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This seemed wisdom despite my callow hubris, so I dashed for shelter. As I went, however, I heard a terrible hissing voice calling, ‘Your name then, Inspector, for this affront will haunt you.’ It was Jack o’ the Devil, and a shiver runs through me whenever I recall it.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Stopping on the threshold, I lit on the name of the only detective inspector I had ever consulted with and cried out, ‘You’ll rue the day you crossed Athelney Jones!’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes paused in his narrative, either because his sense of timing is so apt or because I was laughing so hard I could scarce breathe—laughter which turned quickly into wheezing, which led to coughing, which led to some concern on my friend’s part. The fit would not seem to pass, but I could not regret it, so preferable did the ache in my lungs feel to my former sullen misery. Water was fetched, and sipped.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My God, it’s priceless. How old were you?” I managed finally.</p>
			<p class="bt">The faint flush which praise always brings to Holmes’s thin face had appeared. He resumed his perch on the floor before my knees and rested an elbow on the settee’s edge with an impish twinkle in his gaze.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Twenty-two. Ridiculous, was I not?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I shall defer answering. Come, what did you think of Sherman’s shop?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes shook his head. “You’ve seen that magical menagerie, Watson. It had not changed in the interim and still has not to this day. All the walls were lined with cages, a veritable zoo, and several of the beasts within reared up at the appearance of a stranger. The tables were littered with the macabre tools of the taxidermist—sewing needles and skinning knives and mysterious awls—and the air was pungent with chemicals and manure, but for all these defects it was incongruously cheerful. Well, perhaps some would not say so. Still, my young self was rather taken with the place. Perhaps I thought it as odd as I was. I recall a monkey chattered from the rafters, disturbing the dozen or so plumed birds who also resided there, a pair of conjoined twin weasels bared their teeth and hissed as one at me, and what appeared to be a tamed fox shied away upstairs at my approach.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Where, then, is the viper?’ I asked with due caution after Sherman had bolted us safe within.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Cor, he’s only a corn snake—there’s no harm in ’im, sir, no harm in the world. ’E’s as gentle as that wee bunny yonder. And I’d not risk ’im harming ’imself in a fall fer all the world. But if you wave a wiper, it gets ’em to thinking, supposing as they try to muscle you, eh?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was on my lips to question this reasoning further when a stair creaked from on high and a small woman—very small, almost a child’s size, but well over forty years in age—came shuffling down from the living quarters. She was dressed as plainly as Mr. Sherman, with a cloud of auburn hair streaked with grey and gleaming brown eyes, and she held in her arms a beautiful mottled spaniel pup.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘It’s all right, luv,’ Mr. Sherman called to his wife, for so she was, ‘you can come down. It’s safe enough now, and the door bolted and all. This young inspector ’ere drove the wolves away.’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There is a Mrs. Sherman?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, but there was.” Holmes cast a glance to ensure I was at ease; I smiled encouragingly. “You would have liked her, Watson. In any case, the pup she was holding had escaped and was sniffing my trouser legs and boots, doubtless learning as much as it could of the streets I’d been walking for hours, when Mr. Sherman remarked, ‘You don’t look like any policeman as I ever saw, sir. But you’ll be wantin’ to know what that row signified?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“I succumbed to base temptation and said yes, and here is what Old Sherman told me: Jack o’ the Devil had once been his assistant at bird-stuffing. As repellent a man as he was, he was deft at the work, and business was thriving enough to make him quite valuable. Old Sherman had something of a reputation for dramatic staging, which led to both local and mail orders. Whenever a request came in for a fowl, Jack would do the more menial dressing with tremendous skill and speed, and Old Sherman—who really is something of an artist, Watson—would arrange and put the finishing touches on the pieces.</p>
			<p class="bt">“When Jack o‘ the Devil took up with Plaid Charlie, a known cracksman, Mr. Sherman didn’t like it, but he could hardly tell his assistant who to share a pint with of an evening. So he clucked and hummed but said nothing to the purpose. Then the single treasure the Shermans owned other than their exotic animals, a diamond brooch passed on from Mrs. Sherman’s mother, went missing. Old Sherman decided he’d had quite enough and sent Jack o’ the Devil packing. Now it seemed that Jack would not be shaken off and wanted his position back, and I had interrupted what must have become a violent altercation.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I listened, rapt. “Did you decide to pursue the sinister connection between Jack o’ the Devil and Plaid Charlie?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Excellent hypothesis, but wrong: I lingered. You know how reclusive I am, but the dog had taken a liking to me—whining and pawing and generally making a spectacle of herself. After bragging for ten minutes that Molly the spaniel already had the best tracking nose in London despite her youth, Mrs. Sherman would not allow me to depart before I had taken tea. They were poor in funds despite their revenues on account of the veritable zoo they maintained, but they laid out a feast of tea cakes and some very passable Darjeeling and I found myself loath to deny them. In fact, I confess I stayed still longer talking of obscure byways in biological science with Mr. Sherman, and then the training of tracking dogs with Mrs. Sherman, and when I departed I left my address, though by then I was too ashamed to leave my name.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you know, I <span class="charoverride3">would</span> have liked Mrs. Sherman,” I decided warmly. “Go on, old fellow. The next day you began your campaign?”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend’s eyes shone with mischief. “The next day I was knocked up by the police at my lodgings in Montague Street because Plaid Charlie had been murdered the previous night.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Gaping at him, I lowered my brandy to my lap. “Good heavens, Holmes! <span class="charoverride3">Your </span>lodgings? Whatever for?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You see, they had already taken a culprit for the murder into custody.” Holmes’s expression was as aloof as a statue’s, but his entire torso wriggled with anticipation. “The suspect stridently insisted that he was innocent, and that the only man who could help to save his character was Inspector Athelney Jones. So who should arrive at my wretched little hovel but . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Inspector Athelney Jones and Mr. Sherman!” I exclaimed, and then we both collapsed into laughter once more until we had quite exhausted ourselves.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, you can’t imagine it, Watson,” Holmes crowed, sweeping his arms wide. “It was <span class="charoverride3">delicious.</span> I only wish you could have been present. There were my seedy digs, with their chemical apparatus, a bed, a desk, a wardrobe with two suits in it, and a chair, and there was poor Mr. Sherman and an apoplectic police inspector.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘What’s this, now!’ Jones cried. He was only slightly thinner then, Watson, and his face already as red and shiny as an apple. ‘Oh, here’s a fine business! I arrest a fellow for murder, and I have <span class="charoverride3">my</span> name thrown in my face!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Let me—’ I began.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘ “Athelney Jones,” he says! “Athelney Jones will set it right!” Then I ask him to <span class="charoverride3">describe</span> this Athelney Jones, and—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Just a moment—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘A moment, my eye, Sherlock Holmes! Then he says he has the <span class="charoverride3">address</span> of this Athelney Jones, and—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I can explain everything!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Explain impersonating a police inspector you’ve met once in your life, and harassed with your crackbrained theories no less!’ he cried. ‘Oh, ho, ho! Now, <span class="charoverride3">here’s </span>a pretty business!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘This gentleman was being threatened by one of the cracksmen you are seeking in Lambeth, Inspector,’ I attempted. The odds were against me, Watson, but this time the fates blessed my enterprise and I was able to complete a few sentences. ‘I intervened, and as they fled, I shouted that they would rue the day they crossed Athelney Jones. So you see it is actually quite a flattering mistake.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Is this true?’ the policeman demanded of Old Sherman.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I won’t pretend I wasn’t quaking in my boots a bit by this time, Watson. But Mr. Sherman said yes, there must have been some error, and when he winked at me, I understood that the kind old fellow had thought me only an eccentric good Samaritan, never a policeman at all. He had merely played along with the ruse out of a reluctance to insist on my real identity after I had helped him. Inspector Jones walked up and down booming and flailing his arms a while longer before he finally turned to speak with a constable and I had the chance to corner Sherman.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I’m innocent as snow, but I dread to say where I was last night and there’s no one as witnessed me anyhow,’ the poor soul whispered. The shadows beneath his blue glasses were dreadful to look at, my dear fellow, and his steady artisan’s hands were all atremble. The change that had been wrought in him from the time of our pleasant impromptu tea the day before was most alarming. I could tell the man honestly feared for his life, and when I think of Jones’s acumen, not to mention his bluster, I cannot fault his keen instinct for self-preservation. ‘You’re a right sharp young lad. I ’eard what you said to those villains about the crib they done cracked. God knows we’re strangers, but I’ve a feeling about you, a feeling it’s ’ard to put into words fer all I’m old enough to be yer father. Please, fer ’eaven’s sake, try to solve this or I’ll swing for it.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“It had been so long since I’d sat down to a friendly table with anyone, Doctor—come to think of it, it must have been since college, and my brief acquaintance with Victor Trevor before he went abroad to try his luck at tea farming in faraway Terai—that I never considered refusing, nor stopped to warn myself that an utter greenhand could potentially have done poor Mr. Sherman more harm than benefit. I was all eagerness, arrogance, and optimism. Of course I promised him I should do all I could, and after Athelney Jones had wagged his finger in my face a few more times, and bullied poor Old Sherman into a police wagon, I was off like a rabbit.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“To Sherman’s?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, to the news-agents’ at the corner.” Holmes shrugged sheepishly. “I hadn’t the money to subscribe to every edition then, and so had no notion what the true facts of the murder were, and I’d no desire to listen to another word of Jones’s unparalleled poppycock. Briefly, the case went as so: Plaid Charlie was found knifed in his rooms. The knife was peculiar, the sort used for delicate work with wild game, and had ‘Sherman’ carved on the handle. The word ‘VENGEANCE’ had been scrawled on the wall above, and a stuffed rat was left on the dead man’s chest. It did not take Athelney Jones long to knock up the neighbors and learn Old Sherman was threatened that day, and the inspector drew his version of the natural conclusion.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But that’s entirely preposterous. Why should—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, I know,” he assured me, chuckling. “Then I raced to find Mrs. Sherman. She related the following conclusive facts, though she was so upset at first I could hardly understand her. First, that Plaid Charlie had been not merely a cracksman but a notorious fence of stolen gems. Second, that Mr. Sherman had been passionately poring over his records of late to see where the birds Jack o’ the Devil worked on had been delivered. And third, that there had been another house broken into the night before. So now you must see everything.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I did not, but the atmosphere was so congenial, I felt in no hurry. Sherlock Holmes often sat up all night untangling the threads of a ­problem—why should not I follow his expert example? My friend smoked placidly, and I watched giddy sparks fly away up the flue, and I had just despaired of the attempt when I cried, “By Jove!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I ought not to be so free with my methods,” Holmes affected to grouse. “I shall be out of a profession.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I sat up fully in my excitement, gripping his sinewy shoulder. “Plaid Charlie needed a better way to rid himself of recently stolen jewels and hatched a scheme with Jack o’ the Devil to sew them into taxidermy.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes fairly beamed at me. “Go on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“They then waited until the stones were thought forever lost and acted as cracksmen, taking a number of items so as not to arouse suspicion when the real object was the decorative bird. And Old Sherman was right. It was Jack o’ the Devil who stole Mrs. Sherman’s brooch,” I continued breathlessly. “He sewed it into another bird before he lost his position.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I shall not contradict you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Sherman had been trying to discover its whereabouts and foolishly made his own first attempt at housebreaking, likely because he knew his story preposterous on the face of it and feared to peach on such a dangerous duo to the Yarders. That is the reason he was loath to give you an alibi. He had wanted his wife’s keepsake back but was embarrassed of his method—telling the truth only meant confessing to a second crime.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And?” my friend prompted, waving his pipe in enthusiastic circles. “Who in fact killed Plaid Charlie?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well,” I puzzled, reclining again, “it must have been Jack o’ the Devil, fabricating evidence which pointed to Old Sherman, but why?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah.” Holmes nodded. “Because he supposed that with her husband in the dock, Mrs. Sherman would lose her livelihood, and would hire him back, enabling him to hide his plunder in the fowl again. The man was utterly mad, Watson—killing Plaid Charlie was proof of it. He wanted to become the greatest fence in London and so slaughtered his favorite income source without even blinking. His nasal, grating voice, that leering smile like a gash, the endless servile ducking—he is the seventh most abhorrent man I have ever put behind bars.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What did you do?” I asked avidly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nothing of consequence.” My friend affected complete nonchalance. “I tracked Mr. Sherman’s path the previous night with Molly the spaniel.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I held up my hands. “Just a moment—you mean to tell me that after Sherman had already left his house thousands of times, Molly could trace only the most <span class="charoverride3">recent—</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, she could have, undoubtedly—but she didn’t.” Holmes smirked. “I provided a reverse demonstration, as I thought the good Inspector Jones might appreciate a dramatic conclusion, and I was already developing something of a taste for them. We started at the house Sherman had broken <span class="charoverride3">into</span> the night before, with one of his boots—it was child’s play for Molly to trace his steps backward and discover the stolen bird hidden at the rear of the shop. I whisked off the tarp he had hid it in, opened the carcass, found Mrs. Sherman’s brooch, <span class="charoverride3">et voilà.</span> Alarms for the murder and the theft happened five minutes and two miles apart, so Old Sherman’s alibi was proved.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Wonderful!” I marveled. “But how did it turn out?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Rather splendidly. I was able to cause Jack o’ the Devil’s arrest and subsequent prosecution—his cockiness was so absolute, he had neglected to notice blood on his own clothing, and Molly the spaniel handily proved he had been in Plaid Charlie’s rooms the night previous, which added a bit of circumstantial reinforcement if nothing more. Athelney Jones called me a lucky young rake and told me to join the Yard to learn my craft, which offer I declined. Old Sherman was charged with housebreaking; when we returned the repaired bird, that was reduced to trespass, happily. I visited his jail cell as quickly as I could and told him everything.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh, bless you!’ he cried, wringing me by the hand. ‘You’ve cleared my good name, sir.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I cleared it a trifle,’ said I, dubiously.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Now, never say as Old Sherman don’t know a friendly turn when it’s done ’im. I’ll have six months’ stint at most, likelier four. What’s your real moniker, lad?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh, I beg your pardon. Sherlock Holmes,’ I answered. ‘And forgive me for—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Not another word about that!’ he exclaimed. ‘Whatever I can do for you in future, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I shan’t ’estitate a single tick o’ the clock. And you’ll ’ave as many lessons in zoological anatomy and naturalism as that great brain o’ yours can sponge up, by God, for who can say what use such might prove to a criminologist? I’ll teach you everything I know, lad, and gladly too.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Shall you?’ By this point, my dear fellow, I confess myself to have been somewhat perplexed. ‘But you’re impris—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I’ll not ’ear a single syllable against it!’ he shrieked. ‘Ye’ve done a service, ye have, ye noddle-headed thing, and ye’ll take some hearty home-cooked meals and a serving of education fer it if me wife and I have to shove it down yer scrawny neck like I’d stuff one o’ me dressed weasels, so ’elp me.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“So there you have it, Watson. Old Tom Sherman taught me every­thing I know about practical naturalism as applies to detection after his parole, his wife taught me all about canine tracking and training and made us tea on countless occasions, and whenever I need a dog’s nose, I have the very best in London at my disposal.”</p>
			<p class="bt">We fell into a comfortable silence, Holmes meditating upon the last of his smoke rings and I upon the ceiling.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, was Molly the spaniel Toby’s mother?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Grandmother,” he corrected.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Did Jones take the credit?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course. It was in all the papers, but I was quite content with adding another obscure branch of knowledge to my rainbow array of studies.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Another thought occurred. “Who helped Mrs. Sherman with bird-stuffing while her husband was incarcerated?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How the deuce should I know?” he retorted, and then stretched extravagantly and rolled to his feet.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It <span class="charoverride3">was </span>you,” I accused him, chuckling.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend said nothing, and said it with his back turned to me, which was every bit as good as an affirmative.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What fresh work have we tomorrow?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes lounged at the mantel refilling his pipe, and his languid expression brightened instantly. “Oh, you’ve just reminded me, I’ve a lovely problem for us tomorrow. Come to think of it, we’re lucky the Viking manuscript lot are dragging their heels so dreadfully. Are you well enough to be ready at half ten? Someone has been anonymously mailing Lady Marianne Chandler a lock of hair every day for a fortnight—and according to her letter, each lock is from a different person. She insists every individual cutting is entirely unique and is needless to say quite disturbed in mind over it. Of course, the regular force can do nothing in the absence of any crime, so she has turned to us to study over the collection. Picturesque, don’t you think?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is.” More meaningfully I added, “Thank you. For the story, and for the work.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes’s deep-set eyes narrowed as he frowned. “Not at all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come now, Holmes. I may not be a detective, but it is obvious what you were just doing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And what I was doing was nothing significant.” He lifted one shoulder coolly. “I can offer only the sole anodyne which brings me such vivid scraps of relief from the doldrums—a crime to solve or accounts of crimes past. Twisted puzzles, shocking revelations, a solution tied up with a ribbon and placed in a tin box. A slender consolation indeed. Surely my personal choice of distractions is ludicrously inadequate under the circumstances. Is it not? Well, well, never mind answering that. I shouldn’t, if I were in your place. As regards your own situation, you know I have no experience of such emotions, and thus would be the worst candidate on earth to entrust with your confidences. I can now ring for your soup, and there my usefulness ends.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sighing, I finished my brandy. I wanted to contradict him, for he was egregiously wrong on two counts. First, he was not the worst person on earth to trust with confidences, for he never pitied the giver of them, only listened with focused impatience or silent sympathy, which is why such a hubbub of strangers continually clattered up and down our staircase begging for his help. He was, in fact, the foremost keeper of confidences in London—and he had created the profession, no less. Second, be the person a mother, a brother, a sister, a friend, or some other beloved ghost, I by 1897 knew him to be mistaken in suggesting he lacked for feeling entirely.</p>
			<p class="bt">The discussion ended there, however; Sherlock Holmes rang for my soup and then launched into a detailed and lively account of Lady Chandler’s mysterious follicular woes. So I poured us more brandy and held my peace as ever on the subject of his own sorrows, and the letter which had started it all sat forgotten on the mantelpiece next to my friend’s jackknife.</p>
