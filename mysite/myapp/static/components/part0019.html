<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter014">FOURTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">The room we now entered was built below street level, so that we had to descend three stone steps on to flagstones strewn with rushes, which quickly soaked up the rainwater that streamed from our clothes. A low ceiling, ribbed with dark timbers, made the shop feel close and intimate; Florio and I, being short of stature, could stand upright but Jenkes had to hunch his shoulders so as not to clip his head, a posture that gave him a slightly obsequious air, as if he were permanently half-bowing. There was little light in the room, the grimy diamond-paned windows either side of the door admitting scant daylight in this gloomy weather, though a pair of candles burned in a wall-sconce behind the ware-bench opposite the door. They were of good wax, too, as they did not give off the filthy smell of the cheap tallow kind that lit my chamber at Lincoln. In fact, the narrow shop smelled more like home than any place I had been since my arrival in Oxford, for it smelled of books; a warm scent of new leather and paper, and the mustier traces of old vellum and ink, a heady mixture that brought on a sudden pang of nostalgia for the scriptorium at San Domenico Maggiore where I had spent so many hours of my youth.</p>
<p class="indented">Carved wooden book stacks lined each side of the shop showing the bookbinder’s art: each was filled from floor to ceiling with volumes bound in coloured leather and organised according to size, placed with their fore-edge outwards so that the brass clasps glinted under the darting flames of the candles. Along the bench where Jenkes now stood, rubbing his hands and looking from me to Florio with an expression of greedy anticipation, examples of different types of binding and format were ranged, from the old-fashioned wooden boards encased in calfskin that would keep a parchment manuscript from cockling, to the newer Paris bindings of double paste-board for lighter books of paper, that needed no brass clasps but were tied together with leather thongs or ribbons. All were secured, like the books in Lincoln library, by a brass chain attached to a rod running beneath the bench. Behind this bench, opposite the street door, was another door which gave on to a larger interior room, no better lit than this one, which, from the little I could see within, appeared to be the workshop. I thought I glimpsed the shadow of someone moving, out of sight, and supposed that Jenkes must have apprentices at work.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And this is Signor Filippo Nolano, is it not?’ Jenkes greeted me with a feline smile, holding out a surprisingly delicate hand, which I shook with some reluctance, feeling Florio’s curious eyes on the side of my face. ‘I wondered when we would be seeing you here, after you followed me from the Catherine Wheel the other day.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I – that is …’ I was unsure how to meet this accusation, especially with Florio’s amazed stare burning into me.</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes waved his hand as if to dismiss my small offence.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No matter. But Signor Nolano, I cannot help noticing that our friend here, Signor Florio, seems surprised to hear me address you so. Perhaps he knows you by a different name?’ He raised one eyebrow theatrically, steepling his fingertips together. He had a habit of speaking almost without moving his lips, so that every sentence had the air of a confidence that could not quite be spoken aloud.</p>
<p class="indented">I looked him in the eye, feeling myself at a disadvantage; not only was I in his shop, soaked to the skin, but he had clearly made it his business to find out about me even as I had thought myself to be tailing him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘For many years I travelled in places where it was not safe to give one’s own name,’ I said, setting my shoulders back and attempting to hold myself with some dignity. ‘It has become a habit when among strangers, that is all.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes smiled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘A man would go to any lengths to avoid the Inquisition, I am sure, Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded carefully, trying not to betray any surprise. Florio continued to frown, bemused.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I hope you will not long think of us as strangers. But there are places even in our glorious free realm where a man would do well to watch his words. What drew you to the Catherine Wheel, I wonder?’</p>
<p class="indented">I shrugged.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was hungry. I saw the sign and went to look for hot food.’</p>
<p class="indented">At this, Jenkes threw his head back and guffawed, revealing his crooked teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You soon learned your lesson there, I think. Though it was mischievous of you to tell young Humphrey that you would not give that food even to your dog.’ He stopped laughing just as abruptly as he had begun, leaving a sudden silence hanging in the air.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You speak Italian?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I speak seven languages, Doctor Bruno, though you would not think it to look at me, would you? I do not have the visage of a scholar, I know. But then you know better than to judge a man by his looks. I fancy you are another who is more than he seems. Do you know what they say of me in Oxford?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not,’ I said bluntly. He clearly took pride in his notoriety and I had no wish to flatter his vanity further. I was gratified to see that he looked somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They call me a disciple of the Devil, Bruno,’ he informed me, a half smile playing about his thin lips. ‘Folk songs are made about me to frighten children. They say I killed three hundred men with a single curse. What do you say to that?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I say that gaol fever spreads rapidly in certain conditions,’ I replied evenly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are right, of course. But how, then, was I not touched?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Evidently you have the constitution of an ox,’ I said, glancing at the whorls and knots of scarred skin where his ears had once been. ‘You are no more a sorcerer than I am, or Florio here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No more a sorcerer than you?’ Jenkes watched me for a moment, then burst into another of his sudden gales of laughter. ‘I like your friend, Signor Florio, he is quite the comedian,’ he said, with an air of indulgence. Poor Florio seemed uncomfortable with the undercurrent of antagonism between me and Jenkes, and continued to glance nervously between us.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Have you my Montaigne, Master Jenkes?’ he asked mildly. ‘I do hope so, for I have come out in this treacherous weather for it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Treacherous indeed,’ Jenkes said, sending me the briefest flash of his cryptic smile. ‘Two volumes arrived with a cargo at the end of last week, my dear Florio, and despite this apocalyptic weather, the cart made its way through from Plymouth on Saturday. Let it never be said that I disappoint those who place their faith in my abilities. If you will bear with me a moment, I will find them.’ He gave another brief bow, and keeping his head low, ducked through the doorway into the workshop behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">Florio turned to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I must beg from you an oath of secrecy, Bruno,’ he whispered, laying a hand on my arm, his eyes wide and earnest. I nodded breathlessly, thinking he was still referring to the matter of his note, in which we had been interrupted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have decided to take upon myself a great and solemn task, which will commit my name to posterity as well as that of the great humanist genius I serve – a far greater work, I may say, than my own silly collections of proverbs could ever be.’ He clutched my sleeve tighter, his eyes shining. ‘I am going to bring the essays of Michel de Montaigne to English readers!’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does he know?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">He lowered his gaze, somewhat subdued.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have written to the great man proposing my humble services as his translator, but as yet I do not have his imprimatur, it is true,’ he said. ‘I have asked Master Jenkes to order the French editions for me so that I could send Monsieur de Montaigne a sample, in the hope of winning his approval. But as I’m sure you can imagine, until it is complete, this is a labour of love that will be both time-consuming and expensive, and so you understand now why I had to write to you as I did—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Any book you desire, from any country – just ask Rowland Jenkes, and if I cannot find it, it does not exist,’ Jenkes announced, springing from the shadows like a showman and holding up a slim volume in each hand, each bound in dun calfskin and tied with leather strings. He fixed me with a conspiratorial eye. ‘<em class="calibre2">Any</em> book, Doctor Bruno, for the right price.’ His eyes wandered pointedly to my belt, where Walsingham’s purse was hidden beneath my jerkin. I made no move to acknowledge the look, but I felt suddenly exposed; he already seemed to know more about me than I would have credited, and I wondered if his source was Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">He handed the volumes to Florio, who cradled one in the crook of each arm and looked down at them as lovingly as if they were newborn twins.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You bring in a good many books from the Low Countries, then?’ I asked, as casually as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">‘France, the Low Countries – Spain and Italy sometimes, if there is demand. There are many in Oxford who crave certain material that cannot be got except from abroad. And occasionally the opportunity to traffic the other way arises too.’ He continued to level at me the same half-meaningful, half-mocking stare, as if appraising me for some employment. ‘But I expect you have heard that already, Bruno. Perhaps that explains why you followed me?’</p>
<p class="indented">I did not reply; Florio had begun hopping from one foot to the other in agitation, his face pent-up as if he might burst into tears at any moment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Whatever is the matter, my dear Florio?’ Jenkes asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I – it is only that I did not expect two volumes at once, Master Jenkes, and I fear I cannot – that is, I may need to leave one in your care for a month or two, though I beg you not to sell it, for I will have the money eventually, but—’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes waved the apology aside.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have not the space for unclaimed books, Florio – better you take both now and pay me when you can.’</p>
<p class="indented">Florio’s face lit up with the surprise of a child given sweetmeats.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Master Jenkes – I assure you that you will not have to wait long for your payment, especially if certain developments unfold as I hope.’ Here he threw me an encouraging glance, as if to imply that I understood his meaning; he was mistaken, however, for I remained in the dark. If this was a reference to his enigmatic note, did he mean to imply that he hoped to profit from the deaths at Lincoln? I could only stare blankly at him in response as he fumbled at his belt for the coins he had brought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, Bruno – our business is done,’ he said, when the payment had been made and his new purchases wrapped carefully in oilskin against the weather. ‘Shall we brave the flood once more?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A moment, please,’ Jenkes intervened, as I turned to look at the torrents still sluicing down the window panes. The sky seemed to have grown even darker. ‘I would not wish to detain you longer, Master Florio, but there are matters of business I would discuss with Doctor Bruno, if he could spare me a moment of his time?’ He raised the snaking eyebrow again to convey that he meant more than he was willing to say in front of Florio, who hesitated briefly, then appeared to remember the generous credit Jenkes had just extended and decided to take the hint.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course – I must be back at college in any case. Doctor Bruno – if we do not drown on the journey, shall we speak further this evening?’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded; Florio clutched his parcel closer to his chest, pulled up the hood of his cloak and, with a final meaningful glance at me, stepped out into the downpour.</p>
<p class="indented">Left alone in the small shop with Jenkes, I shuddered involuntarily as the door banged shut behind Florio; the draught had chilled me in my wet clothes, but not as much as the intense stare the bookbinder now turned on me in the wavering shadows of the candles.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come – you will catch a fever standing there and the world will say I cursed you,’ he said with a dry smile, gesturing for me to pass through the door behind the ware-bench. ‘In here we may speak freely, Doctor Bruno, and you may warm yourself. I will heat some sweet wine.’ He crossed to the street door, took a ring of keys from his belt, and locked it. Seeing me hesitate, he turned back, one hand on the door jamb. ‘You may watch me drink it first, if you prefer. But I thought you did not believe in my diabolical powers?’</p>
<p class="indented">The watchful glint in his eye was momentarily displaced by self-mockery; despite myself, I returned his smile and followed him as he ducked through the doorway into the back room. Perhaps I should have been more apprehensive, but though I did not believe the superstitious gossip about the Black Assizes, I found something mesmerising about Rowland Jenkes; so much so that I was willing to be locked into a room alone with him in the hope of learning more about him. But we were not alone. As I crossed the threshold, from the corner of my eye, I caught the movement of a shadow; there, by a fire that blazed in a hearth on the left-hand wall, stood Doctor William Bernard, his thin arms folded across his chest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My workshop – and you are acquainted with Doctor Bernard, of course,’ Jenkes said, taking in the room with a sweeping gesture and paying Bernard no more heed than if he were one of the fittings. Along three walls, long benches lay covered with quires and manuscripts in various states of disrepair; portions of leather, calfskin and cloth were spread out with patterns marked for cutting. Some books were being fitted for linen chemises, outer covers to keep the calfskin bindings clean, while others were halfway through having new brass bosses and cornerpieces fitted to cover frayed or damaged edges. Some of the manuscripts that caught my eye appeared to be of great antiquity, the bookbinder’s skill now preserving and renewing them, ready to continue their journey through the world for the coming generations. In the corner opposite the hearth, two large iron-bound chests stood at right angles to one another, both heavily padlocked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have business with a number of the Lincoln College Fellows, I see,’ I remarked, nodding a greeting to Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am a bookbinder and stationer, Doctor Bruno, of course I have business with the doctors of the university. How else should I make my living?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Master Godwyn, the librarian of Lincoln – he is a customer of yours too?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course,’ Jenkes replied smoothly, his strange translucent eyes never leaving mine. ‘I am often charged with repairing the books of his collection when need arises.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And James Coverdale?’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes exchanged a glance with Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah, yes. Poor Doctor Coverdale. William was just telling me he had been the victim of a violent assault. To think of such things happening in Oxford.’ He pressed a hand to his chest and shook his head ruefully; there was something in his manner that suggested he was mocking me. I wanted to ask further about his connections with Godwyn and Coverdale but Bernard’s hawk-like glare made me hesitate.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Here is a sight to make your heart bleed, Doctor Bruno,’ Jenkes said, turning aside and lifting a small volume from one of the benches, which he placed into my hands. It was a little Book of Hours in the French style from the beginning of the century, and had clearly once been an expensive piece; gingerly I turned over a few pages to reveal richly coloured illuminations in cobalts and crimsons and golds, the borders of each page of text decorated with intricate tracings of leaves, flowers and butterflies against a background of primrose yellow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Here.’ Jenkes took the book from my hand and opened it at a page where both the text and the facing picture had been attacked with a sharp implement, perhaps a knife or a stone, in an attempt to erase them from the vellum. The illumination remained almost intact, showing a kneeling St Thomas Becket being stabbed at the altar with only his face blanked out; the accompanying prayer had been scrubbed to a ghostly trace. ‘Criminal, isn’t it?’ Jenkes remarked. ‘The edict was King Henry’s, near fifty years ago now, but these come into my hands quite often, with all the saints and indulgences obediently cut or rubbed away. If I can restore it, this will fetch a good price in France. Good French workmanship, you see? God’s death, I hate to see a book violated like that, at the whim of a heretic prince! Father to another heretic bastard.’ His lip curled back as he said this, revealing his brown teeth, but his long white fingers stroked the page as if comforting it. This display of sentiment towards his books did nothing to make Jenkes more appealing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will you report me now for seditious words, Doctor Bruno?’ He smiled his thin smile, his eyes never leaving mine. ‘I have no more ears to lose, as you see.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will not report any man for his words,’ I said evenly, meeting his gaze to show him I was unafraid. ‘I came to your country to think and speak and write freely – I assume every citizen here wishes the same.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But to write freely about what?’ Bernard unpeeled himself from the wall by the fire, unfolding his arms and peering at me with his faded eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘About anything I choose,’ I replied, turning to face him. ‘That is what freedom means, does it not?’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes was carefully replacing the Book of Hours on the work bench beside the small knives and implements he would need for its restoration. It occurred to me, watching the neat, almost obsessive way that he laid out his tools, that a bookbinder’s knife would certainly be sharp enough to cut a man’s throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you send many books to sell in Europe?’ I asked, indicating the Book of Hours and trying to keep my voice casual. Jenkes missed nothing; he looked up sharply, then exchanged a glance with Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It sometimes happens that books fall into my hands which could see a man condemned to prison or worse in this country,’ he said, rubbing the edge of his thumb along his lower lip. ‘Then I can find a ready market overseas. But in truth there is no shortage of customers in Oxfordshire and London. Men like yourself, who do not accept the prohibition of books, who believe God gave us reason and judgement to weigh what we read, and who are willing to run the risk for the sake of knowledge.’ He gave a soft laugh and raised his head again to look across at Bernard. ‘You were right, William. Doctor Bernard told me you had a special interest in rare books. Especially those believed lost.’</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard had resumed his stance by the fire and remained motionless, merely offering the briefest of tight-lipped smiles. Of course: Bernard had been the Lincoln College librarian during the great purge of the Oxford libraries, when the authorities had tried to banish all heretical texts from the reach of impressionable young men, just as my abbot had at San Domenico.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I sense there is something you wish to ask, Doctor Bruno?’ Jenkes said, cocking his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The books purged from the college libraries – did they pass through your hands?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Many of them, yes.’ Jenkes glanced at Bernard briefly, then leaned back against his work bench and folded his hands together. ‘Some of the more zealous librarians burned the offending material to please the Visitors, but those with more regard for the value of books brought them to me to redistribute.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked across to Bernard, who remained motionless.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And the books culled from Lincoln in the great purge – did those volumes come to you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I remember every book that passes through my hands, Doctor Bruno. You look sceptical, but I assure you that I do not make idle boasts. When you heard me tell Signor Florio I could procure any book for the right price, that was also the truth.’ His eyes darted hungrily again to the purse at my belt, and this time my hand moved instinctively to cover it, as if I were naked and covering my privates. ‘Tell me, then, is there a particular book you have in mind?’</p>
<p class="indented">He was toying with me, and his repeated allusions to the money I carried made me suddenly uncomfortable; I cursed myself for not having been more discreet with Walsingham’s purse about the college. Well – I had allowed him to lock me inside his shop, so if he meant to rob me, there was little I could do except stand and fight; I checked the work bench beside me to see how quickly I could grab for one of the knives if the need arose. As if reading my thoughts, Jenkes casually reached out and picked up a silver-handled blade and began picking the dirt from under his fingernails with its point.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You need have no fear of speaking here, Bruno – whatever the title, however dangerous the civil authorities or the Church, whichever Church, deem it to be, you cannot shock me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You do not believe in the idea of heresy, then?’ I asked, keeping my eyes on the knife in his hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, you mistake me,’ he said, taking a step towards me so suddenly that I involuntarily stepped back, alarmed at the flash of menace in those strange luminous eyes. ‘I believe in it without question. There is absolute truth, and all else is heresy. There is the true Church, founded by God’s Son upon the apostle Peter, and then there is the blasphemous abomination founded by a fat, crippled fornicator who could not keep his cock in his breeches, and which is now ruled by his heretic bastard. I do not believe that any book should be denied to the man who possesses the wisdom to understand it, Bruno, but that does not mean I am confused about where truth lies. The question is – are you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not understand your meaning,’ I said, but my shoulders tensed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think you do,’ he said, his voice light and pleasant but his eyes still steely, and he moved slowly to position himself between me and the door to the shop. Sweat prickled in my armpits despite the chill of my clothes; I glanced across at Bernard, who stood impervious by the fire as if he were not a part of the scene playing out before him. Draped in his long, black gown, with his thin neck and loose skin, he had the air of a great bird of prey, waiting to see what he might scavenge once the dust had settled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wish only to know whose side you are on, Bruno,’ Jenkes continued.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was not aware that I was required to choose a side,’ I replied, turning to face him. ‘Perhaps I find the idea altogether too simplistic.’</p>
<p class="indented">He barked out that sudden laugh again; the sound echoed from the walls.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is that what you will tell the recording angel on the Day of Judgement? When the Son of Man returns to divide the sheep from the goats, will you protest that you did not care to be either, that you found the choice <em class="calibre2">too simplistic</em>?’ Abruptly he cast the knife away from him; it landed with a clatter among the paraphernalia laid out on the bench, and he stepped closer, laying a hand gently on my shoulder. I braced myself, but did not move. ‘You are a conundrum, Doctor Bruno, do you know that?’ His limpid eyes raked over my face repeatedly, as though by this he might decode the puzzle. ‘You are excommunicate, yet you have the patronage of a Catholic monarch. You reject the supreme authority of the pope and preach the heretical theories of the Pole Copernicus, yet I am told you publicly declare yourself a Catholic. What <em class="calibre2">is</em> your faith, Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked him in the eye. ‘I am a son of the Roman Church, Master Jenkes. You must be the only man in Oxford who doubts my religion – your fellow townsmen cross the street for the chance to spit upon me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you attend Mass and confession?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Am I on trial here? Are you my Inquisitor?’</p>
<p class="indented">He merely continued his stony gaze, though his mouth twisted slightly with contempt. I sighed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I attend Mass.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yet you travel in the company of Sir Philip Sidney, a lapdog to the bastard Elizabeth and an agitator against the Catholic cause.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘As does the Palatine Laski. Do you also question his religion?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Laski is a prince,’ Jenkes said impatiently. ‘You are a runaway monk, a philosopher-for-hire – though evidently a successful one, given the amount of money I am told you flaunt around the town,’ he added, his eyes again straying to my purse. ‘How did you find your way into the company of men like Sidney? Did he or his friends seek you out?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I met him in Padua. He is a fellow writer. What is it you accuse me of, Jenkes?’ I was growing tired of this game; only the possibility that Jenkes knew something about Dean Flemyng’s books and might have seen the lost treatise of the Greek Hermetic manuscript, the book Ficino would not translate, kept me from forcing my way out.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I accuse you of nothing,’ he said, patting my shoulder reassuringly, his manner immediately changed. ‘But I thought you more than anyone would understand that a man must know to whom he speaks before he speaks too freely. My friends and I are not used to seeing strangers at the Catherine Wheel inn, particularly not those who travel with a royal visitation and offer up false names – naturally, it makes us curious. So I will ask you again: what brought you there?’</p>
<p class="indented">I hesitated; if I could persuade Jenkes of my sincerity, it was possible that he would open to me the secret world of the Oxford Catholics, whose contacts with the seminaries in Europe and knowledge of the English mission would be worth more than gold to Walsingham. Yet I sensed that if Jenkes even suspected that I had deceived him, he would despatch me with far less artistry than the Lincoln College killer had displayed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was told it was a place one might go to meet – like-minded people,’ I said quietly.</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Told by whom?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A contact.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In London or Oxford? Or abroad?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oxford,’ I said, without a pause.</p>
<p class="indented">‘His name? Or hers,’ he added, as an afterthought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I prefer not to say.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then how am I to know you are not lying to me, Bruno?’ he asked, his face now inches from mine, so that all his pox scars seemed magnified.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He grew quickly intimate with young Allen, as I told you – they were seen together this morning at the Flower de Luce,’ Bernard interjected from the other side of the room. Jenkes narrowed his eyes; I could almost see his calculations as he weighed this news.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So Thomas Allen has been sharing his confidences with you, has he? I fear he may give you a bad impression of our little group, Bruno – was it he who directed you to us?’</p>
<p class="indented">Realising that Thomas could be in danger if Jenkes believed he had been telling me Edmund Allen’s secrets, I knew I had to deny his involvement, even though I had no idea what effect my next words would have on the two men now watching me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was not Thomas who suggested I visit the Catherine Wheel,’ I said. ‘It was Roger Mercer.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes frowned, letting go of my shoulder. He seemed genuinely wrong-footed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Mercer?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is true that I saw deep him in conversation with Mercer in the courtyard, the night before Roger died,’ Bernard confirmed. ‘I was watching from my window.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘How did the Catherine Wheel enter your conversation?’ Jenkes asked, pointing a long finger into my face.</p>
<p class="indented">I raised a hand and gently moved his finger aside before speaking.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I asked if he knew of any place in Oxford where I might hear Mass said.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You just asked? And he sent you to the Catherine Wheel, just like that?’ Jenkes looked as though he could not decide whether to be incredulous or furious; he twisted his hands together until the knuckles cracked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He suggested I would find friends there, but that I should exercise discretion,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Discretion – as if he knew the meaning of the word! He was ever a damnable fool. His loose tongue would have seen us all dead eventually. To tell a stranger, William, and one who travels with a royal party – can you credit it?’ Jenkes wiped his brow with the back of his hand. ‘Though I was sorry to hear of his cruel death, of course.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It hardly matters now,’ Bernard said, before piously adding, ‘God have mercy on his soul.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes gave me another long, hard look, then appeared to decide in my favour.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, Doctor Bruno – let poor Mercer be proved right. You have found yourself among friends. Come tonight – be there at half-past midnight. Use the rear door, through the inn yard, not the street door. Humphrey will be there – say the password and he will admit you. Wear a cloak with a hood, keep it drawn over your face and take care you are not followed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will there not be watchmen at the North Gate? Surely they will want to know my business at that hour.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Give them a groat and they will not give two shits for your business,’ he said, his eyes flicking again to my belt. ‘But have a care for your purse walking the streets so late. Have you a weapon?’</p>
<p class="indented">I replied that I did not carry one. He picked up the little silver-handled knife from the work bench and held it out to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Take it for tonight. It is only small but it cuts through leather well enough, I am sure it could do some damage if you were set upon. Better than an empty scabbard, anyway.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you – but in any case I will not need my purse for such a meeting, will I?’ I replied.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, but you must bring your purse tonight,’ Jenkes said, his expression suddenly concerned; seeing my look of suspicion, he leaned in with a sly smile. ‘For I do not give away my books for nothing, Doctor Bruno, not even to my brother Catholics.’</p>
<p class="indented">My heart quickened.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Books?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are interested in a book, are you not? A Greek book, brought out of Florence by Dean Flemyng a century ago, bequeathed to the library of Lincoln College, removed by our friend Doctor Bernard here during the purge by the Royal Commission of ’69. Am I correct?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you have this book?’ I whispered, hardly daring to breathe.</p>
<p class="indented">He replied with the same slow, infuriating smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not have it here. But I have held it in my hands, and I can direct you to it. I’m sure we can work out an arrangement that will suit us both, Doctor Bruno. Be sure to bring your purse.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You said the book did not exist,’ I said, turning to Bernard with a note of triumph.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I said so for the sake of those fools gathered around the rector’s table that night,’ he said dismissively. ‘It would have raised too many questions. Underhill is a puppet of the chancellor and the Privy Council – he would not know the value of such a book, but I did not wish to awaken his old anxieties. If he had his way, he would purge the library until there was nothing left upon the lecterns but the Bishop’s Bible and the volumes of Master Foxe.’ For a moment I thought Bernard might spit on the floor, so bitter was the contempt in his voice as he spoke the name, but he restrained himself. I wondered what Jenkes had meant when he said that Mercer’s loose tongue would have had them all killed?</p>
<p class="indented">‘We must not detain you any longer, Doctor Bruno,’ Jenkes said, turning back towards the shop and reaching for the keys at his belt. ‘You will be wanting to catch up with your friend Florio. By the way – it goes without saying that you do not breathe a word of our conversation to anyone. I am the only one who can tell you who to trust in this town where matters of religion are concerned. You understand the dangers, I’m sure.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded, as he unlocked the door to the street and I saw with some relief that the rain had finally begun to thin.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned back to see him standing in the doorway, arms folded across his chest, with an air of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And the book?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will tell you all about the book when we next meet.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have forgotten one thing,’ I said, in a low voice. ‘The password.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes’s pitted face creased into a lop-sided smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, you have already been told, Doctor Bruno,’ he whispered, before mouthing the words, ‘<em class="calibre2">Ora pro nobis</em>.’</p>
