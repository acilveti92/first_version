<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter014">FOURTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">The room we now entered was built below street level, so that we had to descend three stone steps on to flagstones strewn with rushes, which quickly soaked up the rainwater that streamed from our clothes. A low ceiling, ribbed with dark timbers, made the shop feel close and intimate; Florio and I, being short of stature, could stand upright but Jenkes had to hunch his shoulders so as not to clip his head, a posture that gave him a slightly obsequious air, as if he were permanently half-bowing. There was little light in the room, the grimy diamond-paned windows either side of the door admitting scant daylight in this gloomy weather, though a pair of candles burned in a wall-sconce behind the ware-bench opposite the door. They were of good wax, too, as they did not give off the filthy smell of the cheap tallow kind that lit my chamber at Lincoln. In fact, the narrow shop smelled more like home than any place I had been since my arrival in Oxford, for it smelled of books; a warm scent of new leather and paper, and the mustier traces of old vellum and ink, a heady mixture that brought on a sudden pang of nostalgia for the scriptorium at San Domenico Maggiore where I had spent so many hours of my youth.</p>
<p class="indented">Carved wooden book stacks lined each side of the shop showing the bookbinder’s art: each was filled from floor to ceiling with volumes bound in coloured leather and organised according to size, placed with their fore-edge outwards so that the brass clasps glinted under the darting flames of the candles. Along the bench where Jenkes now stood, rubbing his hands and looking from me to Florio with an expression of greedy anticipation, examples of different types of binding and format were ranged, from the old-fashioned wooden boards encased in calfskin that would keep a parchment manuscript from cockling, to the newer Paris bindings of double paste-board for lighter books of paper, that needed no brass clasps but were tied together with leather thongs or ribbons. All were secured, like the books in Lincoln library, by a brass chain attached to a rod running beneath the bench. Behind this bench, opposite the street door, was another door which gave on to a larger interior room, no better lit than this one, which, from the little I could see within, appeared to be the workshop. I thought I glimpsed the shadow of someone moving, out of sight, and supposed that Jenkes must have apprentices at work.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And this is Signor Filippo Nolano, is it not?’ Jenkes greeted me with a feline smile, holding out a surprisingly delicate hand, which I shook with some reluctance, feeling Florio’s curious eyes on the side of my face. ‘I wondered when we would be seeing you here, after you followed me from the Catherine Wheel the other day.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I – that is …’ I was unsure how to meet this accusation, especially with Florio’s amazed stare burning into me.</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes waved his hand as if to dismiss my small offence.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No matter. But Signor Nolano, I cannot help noticing that our friend here, Signor Florio, seems surprised to hear me address you so. Perhaps he knows you by a different name?’ He raised one eyebrow theatrically, steepling his fingertips together. He had a habit of speaking almost without moving his lips, so that every sentence had the air of a confidence that could not quite be spoken aloud.</p>
<p class="indented">I looked him in the eye, feeling myself at a disadvantage; not only was I in his shop, soaked to the skin, but he had clearly made it his business to find out about me even as I had thought myself to be tailing him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘For many years I travelled in places where it was not safe to give one’s own name,’ I said, setting my shoulders back and attempting to hold myself with some dignity. ‘It has become a habit when among strangers, that is all.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes smiled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘A man would go to any lengths to avoid the Inquisition, I am sure, Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded carefully, trying not to betray any surprise. Florio continued to frown, bemused.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I hope you will not long think of us as strangers. But there are places even in our glorious free realm where a man would do well to watch his words. What drew you to the Catherine Wheel, I wonder?’</p>
<p class="indented">I shrugged.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was hungry. I saw the sign and went to look for hot food.’</p>
<p class="indented">At this, Jenkes threw his head back and guffawed, revealing his crooked teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You soon learned your lesson there, I think. Though it was mischievous of you to tell young Humphrey that you would not give that food even to your dog.’ He stopped laughing just as abruptly as he had begun, leaving a sudden silence hanging in the air.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You speak Italian?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I speak seven languages, Doctor Bruno, though you would not think it to look at me, would you? I do not have the visage of a scholar, I know. But then you know better than to judge a man by his looks. I fancy you are another who is more than he seems. Do you know what they say of me in Oxford?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not,’ I said bluntly. He clearly took pride in his notoriety and I had no wish to flatter his vanity further. I was gratified to see that he looked somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They call me a disciple of the Devil, Bruno,’ he informed me, a half smile playing about his thin lips. ‘Folk songs are made about me to frighten children. They say I killed three hundred men with a single curse. What do you say to that?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I say that gaol fever spreads rapidly in certain conditions,’ I replied evenly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are right, of course. But how, then, was I not touched?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Evidently you have the constitution of an ox,’ I said, glancing at the whorls and knots of scarred skin where his ears had once been. ‘You are no more a sorcerer than I am, or Florio here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No more a sorcerer than you?’ Jenkes watched me for a moment, then burst into another of his sudden gales of laughter. ‘I like your friend, Signor Florio, he is quite the comedian,’ he said, with an air of indulgence. Poor Florio seemed uncomfortable with the undercurrent of antagonism between me and Jenkes, and continued to glance nervously between us.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Have you my Montaigne, Master Jenkes?’ he asked mildly. ‘I do hope so, for I have come out in this treacherous weather for it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Treacherous indeed,’ Jenkes said, sending me the briefest flash of his cryptic smile. ‘Two volumes arrived with a cargo at the end of last week, my dear Florio, and despite this apocalyptic weather, the cart made its way through from Plymouth on Saturday. Let it never be said that I disappoint those who place their faith in my abilities. If you will bear with me a moment, I will find them.’ He gave another brief bow, and keeping his head low, ducked through the doorway into the workshop behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">Florio turned to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I must beg from you an oath of secrecy, Bruno,’ he whispered, laying a hand on my arm, his eyes wide and earnest. I nodded breathlessly, thinking he was still referring to the matter of his note, in which we had been interrupted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have decided to take upon myself a great and solemn task, which will commit my name to posterity as well as that of the great humanist genius I serve – a far greater work, I may say, than my own silly collections of proverbs could ever be.’ He clutched my sleeve tighter, his eyes shining. ‘I am going to bring the essays of Michel de Montaigne to English readers!’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does he know?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">He lowered his gaze, somewhat subdued.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have written to the great man proposing my humble services as his translator, but as yet I do not have his imprimatur, it is true,’ he said. ‘I have asked Master Jenkes to order the French editions for me so that I could send Monsieur de Montaigne a sample, in the hope of winning his approval. But as I’m sure you can imagine, until it is complete, this is a labour of love that will be both time-consuming and expensive, and so you understand now why I had to write to you as I did—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Any book you desire, from any country – just ask Rowland Jenkes, and if I cannot find it, it does not exist,’ Jenkes announced, springing from the shadows like a showman and holding up a slim volume in each hand, each bound in dun calfskin and tied with leather strings. He fixed me with a conspiratorial eye. ‘<em class="calibre2">Any</em> book, Doctor Bruno, for the right price.’ His eyes wandered pointedly to my belt, where Walsingham’s purse was hidden beneath my jerkin. I made no move to acknowledge the look, but I felt suddenly exposed; he already seemed to know more about me than I would have credited, and I wondered if his source was Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">He handed the volumes to Florio, who cradled one in the crook of each arm and looked down at them as lovingly as if they were newborn twins.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You bring in a good many books from the Low Countries, then?’ I asked, as casually as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">‘France, the Low Countries – Spain and Italy sometimes, if there is demand. There are many in Oxford who crave certain material that cannot be got except from abroad. And occasionally the opportunity to traffic the other way arises too.’ He continued to level at me the same half-meaningful, half-mocking stare, as if appraising me for some employment. ‘But I expect you have heard that already, Bruno. Perhaps that explains why you followed me?’</p>
<p class="indented">I did not reply; Florio had begun hopping from one foot to the other in agitation, his face pent-up as if he might burst into tears at any moment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Whatever is the matter, my dear Florio?’ Jenkes asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I – it is only that I did not expect two volumes at once, Master Jenkes, and I fear I cannot – that is, I may need to leave one in your care for a month or two, though I beg you not to sell it, for I will have the money eventually, but—’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes waved the apology aside.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have not the space for unclaimed books, Florio – better you take both now and pay me when you can.’</p>
<p class="indented">Florio’s face lit up with the surprise of a child given sweetmeats.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Master Jenkes – I assure you that you will not have to wait long for your payment, especially if certain developments unfold as I hope.’ Here he threw me an encouraging glance, as if to imply that I understood his meaning; he was mistaken, however, for I remained in the dark. If this was a reference to his enigmatic note, did he mean to imply that he hoped to profit from the deaths at Lincoln? I could only stare blankly at him in response as he fumbled at his belt for the coins he had brought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, Bruno – our business is done,’ he said, when the payment had been made and his new purchases wrapped carefully in oilskin against the weather. ‘Shall we brave the flood once more?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A moment, please,’ Jenkes intervened, as I turned to look at the torrents still sluicing down the window panes. The sky seemed to have grown even darker. ‘I would not wish to detain you longer, Master Florio, but there are matters of business I would discuss with Doctor Bruno, if he could spare me a moment of his time?’ He raised the snaking eyebrow again to convey that he meant more than he was willing to say in front of Florio, who hesitated briefly, then appeared to remember the generous credit Jenkes had just extended and decided to take the hint.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course – I must be back at college in any case. Doctor Bruno – if we do not drown on the journey, shall we speak further this evening?’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded; Florio clutched his parcel closer to his chest, pulled up the hood of his cloak and, with a final meaningful glance at me, stepped out into the downpour.</p>
<p class="indented">Left alone in the small shop with Jenkes, I shuddered involuntarily as the door banged shut behind Florio; the draught had chilled me in my wet clothes, but not as much as the intense stare the bookbinder now turned on me in the wavering shadows of the candles.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come – you will catch a fever standing there and the world will say I cursed you,’ he said with a dry smile, gesturing for me to pass through the door behind the ware-bench. ‘In here we may speak freely, Doctor Bruno, and you may warm yourself. I will heat some sweet wine.’ He crossed to the street door, took a ring of keys from his belt, and locked it. Seeing me hesitate, he turned back, one hand on the door jamb. ‘You may watch me drink it first, if you prefer. But I thought you did not believe in my diabolical powers?’</p>
<p class="indented">The watchful glint in his eye was momentarily displaced by self-mockery; despite myself, I returned his smile and followed him as he ducked through the doorway into the back room. Perhaps I should have been more apprehensive, but though I did not believe the superstitious gossip about the Black Assizes, I found something mesmerising about Rowland Jenkes; so much so that I was willing to be locked into a room alone with him in the hope of learning more about him. But we were not alone. As I crossed the threshold, from the corner of my eye, I caught the movement of a shadow; there, by a fire that blazed in a hearth on the left-hand wall, stood Doctor William Bernard, his thin arms folded across his chest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My workshop – and you are acquainted with Doctor Bernard, of course,’ Jenkes said, taking in the room with a sweeping gesture and paying Bernard no more heed than if he were one of the fittings. Along three walls, long benches lay covered with quires and manuscripts in various states of disrepair; portions of leather, calfskin and cloth were spread out with patterns marked for cutting. Some books were being fitted for linen chemises, outer covers to keep the calfskin bindings clean, while others were halfway through having new brass bosses and cornerpieces fitted to cover frayed or damaged edges. Some of the manuscripts that caught my eye appeared to be of great antiquity, the bookbinder’s skill now preserving and renewing them, ready to continue their journey through the world for the coming generations. In the corner opposite the hearth, two large iron-bound chests stood at right angles to one another, both heavily padlocked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have business with a number of the Lincoln College Fellows, I see,’ I remarked, nodding a greeting to Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am a bookbinder and stationer, Doctor Bruno, of course I have business with the doctors of the university. How else should I make my living?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Master Godwyn, the librarian of Lincoln – he is a customer of yours too?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course,’ Jenkes replied smoothly, his strange translucent eyes never leaving mine. ‘I am often charged with repairing the books of his collection when need arises.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And James Coverdale?’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes exchanged a glance with Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah, yes. Poor Doctor Coverdale. William was just telling me he had been the victim of a violent assault. To think of such things happening in Oxford.’ He pressed a hand to his chest and shook his head ruefully; there was something in his manner that suggested he was mocking me. I wanted to ask further about his connections with Godwyn and Coverdale but Bernard’s hawk-like glare made me hesitate.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Here is a sight to make your heart bleed, Doctor Bruno,’ Jenkes said, turning aside and lifting a small volume from one of the benches, which he placed into my hands. It was a little Book of Hours in the French style from the beginning of the century, and had clearly once been an expensive piece; gingerly I turned over a few pages to reveal richly coloured illuminations in cobalts and crimsons and golds, the borders of each page of text decorated with intricate tracings of leaves, flowers and butterflies against a background of primrose yellow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Here.’ Jenkes took the book from my hand and opened it at a page where both the text and the facing picture had been attacked with a sharp implement, perhaps a knife or a stone, in an attempt to erase them from the vellum. The illumination remained almost intact, showing a kneeling St Thomas Becket being stabbed at the altar with only his face blanked out; the accompanying prayer had been scrubbed to a ghostly trace. ‘Criminal, isn’t it?’ Jenkes remarked. ‘The edict was King Henry’s, near fifty years ago now, but these come into my hands quite often, with all the saints and indulgences obediently cut or rubbed away. If I can restore it, this will fetch a good price in France. Good French workmanship, you see? God’s death, I hate to see a book violated like that, at the whim of a heretic prince! Father to another heretic bastard.’ His lip curled back as he said this, revealing his brown teeth, but his long white fingers stroked the page as if comforting it. This display of sentiment towards his books did nothing to make Jenkes more appealing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will you report me now for seditious words, Doctor Bruno?’ He smiled his thin smile, his eyes never leaving mine. ‘I have no more ears to lose, as you see.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will not report any man for his words,’ I said evenly, meeting his gaze to show him I was unafraid. ‘I came to your country to think and speak and write freely – I assume every citizen here wishes the same.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But to write freely about what?’ Bernard unpeeled himself from the wall by the fire, unfolding his arms and peering at me with his faded eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘About anything I choose,’ I replied, turning to face him. ‘That is what freedom means, does it not?’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes was carefully replacing the Book of Hours on the work bench beside the small knives and implements he would need for its restoration. It occurred to me, watching the neat, almost obsessive way that he laid out his tools, that a bookbinder’s knife would certainly be sharp enough to cut a man’s throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you send many books to sell in Europe?’ I asked, indicating the Book of Hours and trying to keep my voice casual. Jenkes missed nothing; he looked up sharply, then exchanged a glance with Bernard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It sometimes happens that books fall into my hands which could see a man condemned to prison or worse in this country,’ he said, rubbing the edge of his thumb along his lower lip. ‘Then I can find a ready market overseas. But in truth there is no shortage of customers in Oxfordshire and London. Men like yourself, who do not accept the prohibition of books, who believe God gave us reason and judgement to weigh what we read, and who are willing to run the risk for the sake of knowledge.’ He gave a soft laugh and raised his head again to look across at Bernard. ‘You were right, William. Doctor Bernard told me you had a special interest in rare books. Especially those believed lost.’</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard had resumed his stance by the fire and remained motionless, merely offering the briefest of tight-lipped smiles. Of course: Bernard had been the Lincoln College librarian during the great purge of the Oxford libraries, when the authorities had tried to banish all heretical texts from the reach of impressionable young men, just as my abbot had at San Domenico.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I sense there is something you wish to ask, Doctor Bruno?’ Jenkes said, cocking his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The books purged from the college libraries – did they pass through your hands?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Many of them, yes.’ Jenkes glanced at Bernard briefly, then leaned back against his work bench and folded his hands together. ‘Some of the more zealous librarians burned the offending material to please the Visitors, but those with more regard for the value of books brought them to me to redistribute.’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked across to Bernard, who remained motionless.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And the books culled from Lincoln in the great purge – did those volumes come to you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I remember every book that passes through my hands, Doctor Bruno. You look sceptical, but I assure you that I do not make idle boasts. When you heard me tell Signor Florio I could procure any book for the right price, that was also the truth.’ His eyes darted hungrily again to the purse at my belt, and this time my hand moved instinctively to cover it, as if I were naked and covering my privates. ‘Tell me, then, is there a particular book you have in mind?’</p>
<p class="indented">He was toying with me, and his repeated allusions to the money I carried made me suddenly uncomfortable; I cursed myself for not having been more discreet with Walsingham’s purse about the college. Well – I had allowed him to lock me inside his shop, so if he meant to rob me, there was little I could do except stand and fight; I checked the work bench beside me to see how quickly I could grab for one of the knives if the need arose. As if reading my thoughts, Jenkes casually reached out and picked up a silver-handled blade and began picking the dirt from under his fingernails with its point.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You need have no fear of speaking here, Bruno – whatever the title, however dangerous the civil authorities or the Church, whichever Church, deem it to be, you cannot shock me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You do not believe in the idea of heresy, then?’ I asked, keeping my eyes on the knife in his hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, you mistake me,’ he said, taking a step towards me so suddenly that I involuntarily stepped back, alarmed at the flash of menace in those strange luminous eyes. ‘I believe in it without question. There is absolute truth, and all else is heresy. There is the true Church, founded by God’s Son upon the apostle Peter, and then there is the blasphemous abomination founded by a fat, crippled fornicator who could not keep his cock in his breeches, and which is now ruled by his heretic bastard. I do not believe that any book should be denied to the man who possesses the wisdom to understand it, Bruno, but that does not mean I am confused about where truth lies. The question is – are you?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not understand your meaning,’ I said, but my shoulders tensed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think you do,’ he said, his voice light and pleasant but his eyes still steely, and he moved slowly to position himself between me and the door to the shop. Sweat prickled in my armpits despite the chill of my clothes; I glanced across at Bernard, who stood impervious by the fire as if he were not a part of the scene playing out before him. Draped in his long, black gown, with his thin neck and loose skin, he had the air of a great bird of prey, waiting to see what he might scavenge once the dust had settled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wish only to know whose side you are on, Bruno,’ Jenkes continued.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was not aware that I was required to choose a side,’ I replied, turning to face him. ‘Perhaps I find the idea altogether too simplistic.’</p>
<p class="indented">He barked out that sudden laugh again; the sound echoed from the walls.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is that what you will tell the recording angel on the Day of Judgement? When the Son of Man returns to divide the sheep from the goats, will you protest that you did not care to be either, that you found the choice <em class="calibre2">too simplistic</em>?’ Abruptly he cast the knife away from him; it landed with a clatter among the paraphernalia laid out on the bench, and he stepped closer, laying a hand gently on my shoulder. I braced myself, but did not move. ‘You are a conundrum, Doctor Bruno, do you know that?’ His limpid eyes raked over my face repeatedly, as though by this he might decode the puzzle. ‘You are excommunicate, yet you have the patronage of a Catholic monarch. You reject the supreme authority of the pope and preach the heretical theories of the Pole Copernicus, yet I am told you publicly declare yourself a Catholic. What <em class="calibre2">is</em> your faith, Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked him in the eye. ‘I am a son of the Roman Church, Master Jenkes. You must be the only man in Oxford who doubts my religion – your fellow townsmen cross the street for the chance to spit upon me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you attend Mass and confession?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Am I on trial here? Are you my Inquisitor?’</p>
<p class="indented">He merely continued his stony gaze, though his mouth twisted slightly with contempt. I sighed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I attend Mass.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yet you travel in the company of Sir Philip Sidney, a lapdog to the bastard Elizabeth and an agitator against the Catholic cause.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘As does the Palatine Laski. Do you also question his religion?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Laski is a prince,’ Jenkes said impatiently. ‘You are a runaway monk, a philosopher-for-hire – though evidently a successful one, given the amount of money I am told you flaunt around the town,’ he added, his eyes again straying to my purse. ‘How did you find your way into the company of men like Sidney? Did he or his friends seek you out?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I met him in Padua. He is a fellow writer. What is it you accuse me of, Jenkes?’ I was growing tired of this game; only the possibility that Jenkes knew something about Dean Flemyng’s books and might have seen the lost treatise of the Greek Hermetic manuscript, the book Ficino would not translate, kept me from forcing my way out.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I accuse you of nothing,’ he said, patting my shoulder reassuringly, his manner immediately changed. ‘But I thought you more than anyone would understand that a man must know to whom he speaks before he speaks too freely. My friends and I are not used to seeing strangers at the Catherine Wheel inn, particularly not those who travel with a royal visitation and offer up false names – naturally, it makes us curious. So I will ask you again: what brought you there?’</p>
<p class="indented">I hesitated; if I could persuade Jenkes of my sincerity, it was possible that he would open to me the secret world of the Oxford Catholics, whose contacts with the seminaries in Europe and knowledge of the English mission would be worth more than gold to Walsingham. Yet I sensed that if Jenkes even suspected that I had deceived him, he would despatch me with far less artistry than the Lincoln College killer had displayed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I was told it was a place one might go to meet – like-minded people,’ I said quietly.</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Told by whom?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A contact.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In London or Oxford? Or abroad?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oxford,’ I said, without a pause.</p>
<p class="indented">‘His name? Or hers,’ he added, as an afterthought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I prefer not to say.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then how am I to know you are not lying to me, Bruno?’ he asked, his face now inches from mine, so that all his pox scars seemed magnified.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He grew quickly intimate with young Allen, as I told you – they were seen together this morning at the Flower de Luce,’ Bernard interjected from the other side of the room. Jenkes narrowed his eyes; I could almost see his calculations as he weighed this news.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So Thomas Allen has been sharing his confidences with you, has he? I fear he may give you a bad impression of our little group, Bruno – was it he who directed you to us?’</p>
<p class="indented">Realising that Thomas could be in danger if Jenkes believed he had been telling me Edmund Allen’s secrets, I knew I had to deny his involvement, even though I had no idea what effect my next words would have on the two men now watching me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was not Thomas who suggested I visit the Catherine Wheel,’ I said. ‘It was Roger Mercer.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes frowned, letting go of my shoulder. He seemed genuinely wrong-footed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Mercer?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is true that I saw deep him in conversation with Mercer in the courtyard, the night before Roger died,’ Bernard confirmed. ‘I was watching from my window.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘How did the Catherine Wheel enter your conversation?’ Jenkes asked, pointing a long finger into my face.</p>
<p class="indented">I raised a hand and gently moved his finger aside before speaking.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I asked if he knew of any place in Oxford where I might hear Mass said.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You just asked? And he sent you to the Catherine Wheel, just like that?’ Jenkes looked as though he could not decide whether to be incredulous or furious; he twisted his hands together until the knuckles cracked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He suggested I would find friends there, but that I should exercise discretion,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Discretion – as if he knew the meaning of the word! He was ever a damnable fool. His loose tongue would have seen us all dead eventually. To tell a stranger, William, and one who travels with a royal party – can you credit it?’ Jenkes wiped his brow with the back of his hand. ‘Though I was sorry to hear of his cruel death, of course.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It hardly matters now,’ Bernard said, before piously adding, ‘God have mercy on his soul.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes gave me another long, hard look, then appeared to decide in my favour.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, Doctor Bruno – let poor Mercer be proved right. You have found yourself among friends. Come tonight – be there at half-past midnight. Use the rear door, through the inn yard, not the street door. Humphrey will be there – say the password and he will admit you. Wear a cloak with a hood, keep it drawn over your face and take care you are not followed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will there not be watchmen at the North Gate? Surely they will want to know my business at that hour.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Give them a groat and they will not give two shits for your business,’ he said, his eyes flicking again to my belt. ‘But have a care for your purse walking the streets so late. Have you a weapon?’</p>
<p class="indented">I replied that I did not carry one. He picked up the little silver-handled knife from the work bench and held it out to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Take it for tonight. It is only small but it cuts through leather well enough, I am sure it could do some damage if you were set upon. Better than an empty scabbard, anyway.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you – but in any case I will not need my purse for such a meeting, will I?’ I replied.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, but you must bring your purse tonight,’ Jenkes said, his expression suddenly concerned; seeing my look of suspicion, he leaned in with a sly smile. ‘For I do not give away my books for nothing, Doctor Bruno, not even to my brother Catholics.’</p>
<p class="indented">My heart quickened.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Books?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are interested in a book, are you not? A Greek book, brought out of Florence by Dean Flemyng a century ago, bequeathed to the library of Lincoln College, removed by our friend Doctor Bernard here during the purge by the Royal Commission of ’69. Am I correct?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you have this book?’ I whispered, hardly daring to breathe.</p>
<p class="indented">He replied with the same slow, infuriating smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not have it here. But I have held it in my hands, and I can direct you to it. I’m sure we can work out an arrangement that will suit us both, Doctor Bruno. Be sure to bring your purse.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You said the book did not exist,’ I said, turning to Bernard with a note of triumph.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I said so for the sake of those fools gathered around the rector’s table that night,’ he said dismissively. ‘It would have raised too many questions. Underhill is a puppet of the chancellor and the Privy Council – he would not know the value of such a book, but I did not wish to awaken his old anxieties. If he had his way, he would purge the library until there was nothing left upon the lecterns but the Bishop’s Bible and the volumes of Master Foxe.’ For a moment I thought Bernard might spit on the floor, so bitter was the contempt in his voice as he spoke the name, but he restrained himself. I wondered what Jenkes had meant when he said that Mercer’s loose tongue would have had them all killed?</p>
<p class="indented">‘We must not detain you any longer, Doctor Bruno,’ Jenkes said, turning back towards the shop and reaching for the keys at his belt. ‘You will be wanting to catch up with your friend Florio. By the way – it goes without saying that you do not breathe a word of our conversation to anyone. I am the only one who can tell you who to trust in this town where matters of religion are concerned. You understand the dangers, I’m sure.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded, as he unlocked the door to the street and I saw with some relief that the rain had finally begun to thin.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned back to see him standing in the doorway, arms folded across his chest, with an air of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And the book?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will tell you all about the book when we next meet.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have forgotten one thing,’ I said, in a low voice. ‘The password.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jenkes’s pitted face creased into a lop-sided smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why, you have already been told, Doctor Bruno,’ he whispered, before mouthing the words, ‘<em class="calibre2">Ora pro nobis</em>.’</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter012" class="calibre4">TWELVE</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">The song of the <em class="calibre6">castrati</em> rose up to the canopy of the heavens in layers of shifting harmonies, fluting, unearthly – unnatural, to my ears. I had always been disturbed by the sound of those soft-bodied, hairless creatures, trapped in perpetual limbo between boy and man. Under cover of their music I slipped between masked guests at the back of the hall, behind the raised dais with the thrones – still empty – in search of a vantage point where I could watch both the stage and the crowds unobserved. As I passed behind two women talking in strident, aristocratic voices, I caught a phrase in their conversation which caused me to slow my step and hover, straining to listen.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Fury of the League,’ said one, letting a snigger escape behind her fan. ‘Who’d have thought?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Fervour like that, you can always be sure it’s hiding something,’ her companion remarked. ‘Wanting the world to think she’s some kind of saint. And all the while – incest and murder!’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Hardly incest, <em class="calibre6">chérie</em>,’ said the first. ‘He was her husband’s cousin, not hers.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Family by marriage, it’s all one,’ the second woman said, adjusting her lace shawl over bare shoulders. The general noise of conversation in the hall was so great she had to lean in and shout. ‘And he was still a man in holy orders, cousin or no. I wouldn’t be surprised if she did it herself.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Stabbed through the heart, I heard.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Really? Henriette said his throat was cut.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘How would Henriette know?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She knows people.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Could a woman do such a thing, do you think? A duchess?’</p>
<p class="indented">The second woman rippled her fan and shuddered. ‘That one could. She’d stab you with a look if she had the chance.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Keep your voice down – I heard she’s here tonight. Could be right behind us, for all we know.’ She glanced around; I looked quickly at the floor and shuffled a few paces away. The woman’s gaze slid over me without interest behind her scarlet mask. ‘Anyway, she’s a Guise by blood, what do you expect?’ she continued, when she was satisfied that their subject was not within earshot. ‘Her brother the Duke’s had most of the women in this room. Apart from me,’ she added, in case of doubt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘At least he’s only had the women,’ the second one said, at the same volume. ‘Unlike the King.’ She gave a merciless snort of laughter.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It’s Queen Louise I pity,’ said the first, in a sympathetic voice. ‘Imagine being married to that. If I were her I’d drink poison.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If <em class="calibre6">I</em> were her, I’d bed the nearest courtier, tell the King it was his. Solve everything at one stroke,’ the other whispered. ‘I’m surprised she hasn’t had the wit to try it before now.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She probably did, but the courtiers were too busy bedding each other.’</p>
<p class="indented">They collapsed into a fit of malicious giggles, clutching one another’s arms. I moved away before they noticed me. So gossip had already declared that the Duchess of Montpensier was behind Joseph’s murder, because they were lovers. I wondered how long those rumours had been in circulation, and where they originated. I recalled Frère Benoît saying that the abbey gossip declared Joseph’s mistress to be a married noblewoman, and thought of the passionate note I had found among the almoner’s papers, now carefully hidden in a box with my most dangerous writings behind a loose rafter in the ceiling of my lodgings. I knew better than to draw any conclusions from hearsay, but the same unease that had dogged me since my meeting with Guise grew sharper. What meagre scraps of information I had gathered all suggested that the Duchess had a greater motive than anyone – save Guise himself – to silence both Paul and Joseph. I had no idea whether she was a woman who could kill in cold blood, as the gossips claimed, though Paget had remarked that she was ruthless in her brother’s cause. Was it possible that she could have organised both murders – even carried out one of them – without the Duke of Guise knowing? There was also the manner of Joseph’s death to consider, and Paget’s suggestion that he had been killed by his lover while he was naked and off guard. But if that were the case, how would Guise respond if my investigation appeared to be leading towards his own sister? I could answer that too easily; he would be all the keener on his original plan of blaming me for de Chartres’s death as an agent of the King.</p>
<p class="indented">I slunk away to the side of the hall and found myself a spot by a pillar with a view of the stage and the dais with the thrones. To my right, a brazier coughed out its scented smoke, stinging my eyes and the back of my throat, though at least it gave off some warmth. I wondered again what herbs they were burning; already I felt a little light-headed and was grateful for the solidity of the stone at my back. The <em class="calibre6">castrati</em> reached the crescendo of their song, though their voices were barely audible by now over the hum of conversation. In the smoky air and torchlight, the crowd of guests appeared garish and alien, with their exotic colours and the blank or distorted expressions lent them by the masks; a host of half-human creatures risen up from a subterranean world for their demonic revels. Every time someone looked at me for a heartbeat too long I imagined malice in their eyes, and was rocked by the fear that they could see through my disguise, that I alone was standing naked and exposed in a hostile crowd. I shook my head and blinked hard; I needed to stop this and keep my wits about me. It was still early and the King had ordered me not to leave without his permission, though I was not sure what more he wanted from me. The name ‘Circe’ had visibly upset him, that much was clear, but I had no idea why unless he deigned to explain further.</p>
<p class="indented">A woman dressed as a milkmaid drifted towards me in a gown cut low in the bodice so that her breasts were almost spilling out. She looked at me sidelong from under her mask; for a moment I thought she meant to speak, but as she moved past with uncertain steps I saw that her eyes were glazed, unfocused. An empty glass – not her first – dangled from her hand. She might have been the Duchess of Montpensier for all I knew. Those women had speculated that she was here; the one thing I might usefully do tonight would be to watch her under cover of my Doctor’s costume, but first I would need someone to identify her, and that would require me to find one of the few people at the ball to whom I could reveal myself.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em class="calibre6">castrati </em>took their bows to polite applause, though only those nearest the stage showed them much attention; the rest of the crowd remained intent on their own conversations at a volume that filled the hall like the roar of a cataract. Piqued, the eunuchs stalked off stage and I drew myself up straighter, eager to see Francesco and his friends make their entrance. Instead, the cold, clear note of a trumpet cut through the noise; a deferential silence descended and the guests fell back on either side to create a path through the room for the royal party.</p>
<p class="indented">She entered on an open litter borne by four strong men dressed as Saracens, naked from the waist up and walking at a stately pace, the timing of their steps impeccable despite the veins straining in their muscled arms and the sweat beading their brows and chests. Catherine de Medici sat in her chair proud as a martial statue, head erect, eyes fixed straight ahead. She had made no concession to the demands of a costume ball. Instead she was dressed, as always, in a high-necked gown of black velvet with a neat white ruff and a black collar fanning stiffly behind her neck, her hair scraped back under a black hood and draped at the back with a black lace veil, the sober widow’s uniform she had worn since her husband was killed in a joust a quarter-century ago. Her heavy-jowelled face was bare of cosmetics, though I noticed her brows had been artfully plucked, and she wore no jewellery except her wedding ring and a signet ring. I bowed the knee along with the rest of the company as she passed, sneaking a glance at her marble composure. Here was a woman who truly deserved to be called ruthless, though I could not help but admire her: she had fought to preserve the throne of France for her sons with the ferocity of a she-wolf defending her cubs, and the strain of those twenty-five years showed in the furrows of her brow and the pouches beneath her eyes. If, at sixty-six, she was losing her appetite for the fight, you would never guess it from her demeanour, just as you would never know the constant pain she suffered from gout and rheumatism; she rode through the crowd with her face set like a general riding into battle, as consummate a performer as any of the acts who would appear before her on stage.</p>
<p class="indented">Walking behind her, Henri’s neglected wife Queen Louise cut a sorry figure; she had never been a robust woman, but she seemed to have faded since I last saw her, perhaps as a result of the endless fasting and pilgrimages she undertook in the hope of bargaining with the Blessed Virgin to give her a child; all wasted efforts if it was true that her husband never visited her bed. She was dressed tonight as a lady from a chivalric tale of centuries past, in a high-waisted green gown which accentuated the angles of her spare frame. Her shoulders and collarbone jutted sharply through the fabric; the tall conical headdress with its drifting veil appeared too heavy for her slender neck. She walked as if it pained her to lift her head and her eyes were ringed with purple shadows. Three young women carried her train, all pink-cheeked and vital by contrast with their mistress, who stumbled more than once in her progress towards the thrones like an old woman, though she could not be much above thirty. I thought of the gossip who had said she would take poison if she were married to Henri. One might be forgiven for thinking Queen Louise had been doing exactly that. Of her husband the King there was no sign; I presumed his mother had sent him to get changed.</p>
<p class="indented">The silence lasted until the royal party had settled themselves into the thrones on the dais, with a gaggle of courtiers and ladies strewn artfully on cushions at their feet. Catherine rose with some effort and stood at the front of the platform; as if on cue, the assembled guests erupted into rapturous applause and cheers, which she accepted with a nod and an inclination of her head to either side. When she had taken her seat again, the guests arranged themselves with an unnecessary degree of fuss and argument on the tiered stands ranged along the sides of the hall. Finally, Catherine raised her hand and the musicians struck up a tune as the players of <em class="calibre6">I Gelosi</em> took to the stage and assumed their poses.</p>
<p class="indented">I had my reservations about the Commedia in general – there were limitations, I felt, to how much of human nature could be shown in its stock characters and scenarios – but Francesco and Isabella and their companions were so skilled in their stagecraft, so finely tuned in the physical comedy of their storytelling, that, watching them, I found myself laughing with sheer delight in their invention along with the rest of the audience, so absorbed in the performance that I did not notice any movement in the shadows behind the pillar until I felt a hand close around my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Almost like home, eh?’ Spoken in Italian; a soft voice, sibilant, Florentine accent. I turned to see Balthasar de Beaujoyeux at my side, casually holding my arm, his lists and running orders bunched in his other hand. He did not wear a mask; it made his face look startlingly undefended among the disguised guests. Behind my own mask, my breathing sounded unnaturally loud. He gestured with his papers towards the stage.</p>
<p class="indented">‘For my money, Isabella Andreini is the finest performer in Italy – though Italy is too blind to see it. You have heard the bishops want to ban women from the stage altogether?’ He clicked his tongue, indignant. ‘Their loss is Paris’s gain, do you not agree?’</p>
<p class="indented">I stole a sidelong glance at him, saying nothing. He was still holding my arm with a grip firm enough to make a point. His close-cropped black hair and beard were flecked with grey; there was a severity to his good looks, and his dark eyes missed nothing. I had not known him well the last time I was at court, before I left for England, but I had never sensed that he was one of those courtiers who resented my friendship with the King, or had actively pursued my downfall – unlike Cosimo Ruggieri, the Queen Mother’s astrologer. On the few occasions we met, Balthasar had treated me with courtesy and even a degree of warmth. But he held himself generally aloof, as if he believed that his position at court was uniquely elevated; he may be working as Henri’s secretary now, but he was always Catherine’s man, and I had no idea if he was trying to trick me into revealing myself so that he could scurry to inform her that a <em class="calibre6">persona non grata</em> had entered her halls. There was an outside chance he had taken me for someone else, though the fact that he had addressed me in our shared language argued against that.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come now, Giordano Bruno,’ he whispered, as if reading my thoughts. ‘Do you think I lack eyes to see?’ But he did not speak unkindly. ‘I did not spot it immediately, I admit,’ he continued, when I still refused to speak. ‘But I have known the <em class="calibre6">Gelosi </em>since they first came to Paris. I knew you were not their usual Dottore. Besides, I can count above ten. They have never before brought an understudy. I only realised who they had smuggled in when I saw how you avoided my eye. But you always did like to flirt with danger.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What will you do?’ I said eventually.</p>
<p class="indented">He lifted one shoulder, non-committal. ‘Your presence is of no consequence to me, as long as I will not be blamed if she discovers you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘She will not, if no one tells her. It was the King’s idea.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That does not surprise me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I hear you are his secretary now.’</p>
<p class="indented">He allowed a small pause; I sensed he was weighing up his words. ‘I serve His Majesty and Queen Louise. These are difficult times – so much potential for betrayal. And Henri has not always exercised good judgement in his choice of intimates, as you know. Catherine wished him to be served by a close circle whose loyalty she can vouch for personally.’</p>
<p class="indented">And who will report back to her on the King’s every move, I thought. ‘It must give you less time to spend on all this, though.’ I gestured to the stage, the decorations overhead. He inclined his head with a wry twist of his mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Truth to tell, there have not been many entertainments since you left, not the way we used to have. The coffers have been emptied to arm the troops. This is the first on such a scale in three years or more.’ He sighed. ‘I still teach the girls dancing most days, but you are right – I have missed it. I am more at home chivvying players and musicians than copying dispatches – for all the nerves it gives me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will not keep you from it, then.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No – I must go.’ He pursed his lips. ‘Well, I shall forget I have seen you. But take care you don’t run into Ruggieri. He won’t miss the chance to do you harm.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘True. Ruggieri has always hated me.’</p>
<p class="indented">Balthasar smiled. ‘Because your reputation as a magician eclipsed his.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That was more slander—’</p>
<p class="indented">He held up a hand to stop me. ‘I have no quarrel with you, Bruno. You are my countryman, whatever they say about you. Personally, I always felt you rather livened up the place. Not that this court has ever wanted for incident,’ he added, with a hint of pride. He tightened his grip and pulled me closer, conspiratorial. ‘I warn you only because if I have recognised you, others may too, and there are plenty here who are not your friends. The Queen Mother is in a particularly unforgiving temper with the strain of this entertainment. I would not count on Henri to take responsibility, if she finds you here.’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded, though my eyes were drawn again to the stage, where Isabella had stretched herself over backwards, her body arched so that only her feet and palms touched the ground. She lifted one leg, toes delicately pointed, followed by the other, balanced for a moment on her hands, then allowed her legs to scissor above her head and down to the boards behind her, slowly and with perfect control, so that she was upright once more, her body describing two fluid curves in the manoeuvre. This was an innovation of her own but the audience seemed to appreciate it; they erupted into whistles and applause, as much for the glimpse of lean stockinged thigh the move had afforded them as for its daring.</p>
<p class="indented">‘She is quite something, isn’t she?’ Balthasar murmured. ‘But wait until you see my girls dance their masque. Holy Mother – I must go and rally them, we are next. You’ll enjoy this one – the Masque of Circe.’ He let go of my arm and levered himself forward from the pillar with a little bounce before setting off around the back of the stand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wait!’</p>
<p class="indented">I had raised my voice too far, and in Italian; a few guests standing nearby turned their heads to look. Balthasar spun on his heel and gave me a hard look.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Masque of Circe, you said?’ I caught up with him, clutching at his sleeve.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s right. The enchantress who deprives men of their reason and turns them into beasts. Well – you know your Homer. Allegorical, naturally. France lulled into complacency by the Protestants, rescued by our gallant king.’ He arched an eyebrow to acknowledge the irony. ‘But you will spend yourself in your breeches when you see our Circe. I must go.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘One more thing. Is Gabrielle de la Tour still among your dancers?’</p>
<p class="indented">He broke into a knowing smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah. <em class="calibre6">Cara</em> Gabrielle. One of my finest, though by rights she is past her prime. Do you have a particular interest to declare?’</p>
<p class="indented">I made the calculation; Gabrielle would be no more than twenty-eight, at most. A cold sensation prickled up the back of my neck, despite the rising heat of bodies and braziers in the room.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is she …’ I hesitated. ‘She is not dancing the part of Circe?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will see for yourself in a few moments. I would not wish to spoil the surprise.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will you tell her …’ Again I paused; this was truly a risk, to reveal myself to a woman I had not seen for more than three years, and who had no reason to show me loyalty. But Gabrielle was my only point of access to the secret life of the court, as Paget had intimated, and if I did not take my chance now it may not come again. ‘Tell her I am here, and I would be glad to speak to her, if she is so inclined.’</p>
<p class="indented">Balthasar twisted his mouth; he seemed uncertain.</p>
<p class="indented">‘If you think that wise. But she will not be free until after the masque, and it may be that others have a prior claim on her time … Still, I will convey your regards, in any case.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will be in your debt.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know you will.’ He nodded, turned again and disappeared through clusters of standing spectators with his sprightly gait. I did not entirely trust him to keep my secret; I could only hope that his anxiety about being implicated in having allowed me to enter with the <em class="calibre6">Gelosi</em> would keep his lips sealed as far as Catherine was concerned.</p>
<p class="indented"><em class="calibre6">The Masque of Circe</em>. I turned the phrase over and over, my feet rooted to the floor as my mind raced. It was like trying to assemble shards of a broken mirror; a few fragments now appeared to fit together and I had begun to see a jagged, if partial, reflection. Paul’s letter had warned of some harm to be perpetrated by ‘Circe’, a threat I had to assume he was trying to reiterate to me with his dying breath. I had supposed it was a code name for an operative of the Catholic League, but after what Balthasar had told me, it seemed possible – likely, even – that Paul’s last word had a less cryptic meaning; surely it could not be a coincidence that the women of the court were to present the story of Circe tonight? Henri had already observed that many of his adversaries were in attendance at the ball; still others might have slipped in uninvited. Where, then, did the danger lie? In the masque itself? In the person of ‘Circe’?</p>
<p class="indented">I became aware that the guests had broken into applause and cheering. I forced myself to focus and saw that Francesco and his troupe were already making their bows, blowing extravagant kisses to the audience. At each side of the stage, servants had taken up positions ready to shift scenery and replenish the candles for the next act. The masque would begin shortly. I felt a sudden wave of dizziness; my knees buckled as all the sounds of the hall receded, falling away like a retreating wave, and I was overcome by a terrible premonition. Something was going to happen to Henri during the masque, I felt sure of it. That was what Paul had been trying to tell me. Sitting there in the centre of a raised platform for all to see, relaxed, guard down, his attention on the dancing girls – the King would be an easy target. One lead shot in the chest from close range would be all that was needed; though there were guards armed with halberds positioned around the dais, they would not be able to move fast enough to prevent a hit. It would be suicide, of course; the assassin could not hope to escape in such a public place, but Paris was not short of fanatical Catholics who would willingly martyr themselves for the chance to rid France of her heretical monarch.</p>
<p class="indented">I glanced across to the royal party; Henri’s throne was still empty. Another possibility occurred: that the King had been lured into an assignation in the gardens – he had hinted earlier that he intended a tryst tonight – where some violence would befall him while the guests and his attendants were distracted by the masque. It might be supposed that a sovereign who knows himself to be the target of an active conspiracy would not agree to a rendezvous in a dark garden, but I was not convinced that even Henri’s instinct for self-preservation was strong enough to override the promptings of his loins and the impish desire to defy his mother when the mood took him. I suspected he would relish the idea of sneaking out in disguise, without his bodyguards. Given what he called his ‘catholic tastes’, the potential assassin could be anyone – man or woman, duchess, lord or servant. I needed to warn him; he may be walking towards a flashing blade in the dark even at this moment.</p>
<p class="indented">Jacopo Corbinelli had taken a discreet seat at the back of the royal platform, behind Queen Louise’s right shoulder, still cheerful beneath his Pantalone mask. If I could get word to him, he would surely know what to do; he would be able to rally the King’s armed men and search for him in the gardens.</p>
<p class="indented">I edged nearer to the dais through the standing spectators, those who had not managed to find a seat on the tiered benches. Two guards stood at either side of the stage to prevent anyone from encroaching too closely on the royal party, but their presence appeared to be more for show; they held their weapons loosely and their concentration was all bent on the stage at the far end, where the women of the Flying Squadron were expected to appear at any moment in their notoriously revealing costumes. I moved a few steps closer until I was within Jacopo’s eyeline and coughed loudly. One or two people nearby turned with disapproving looks, but Jacopo was leaning forward to speak to Queen Louise and appeared not to have heard. I took another step nearer and coughed again, but this had brought me out of the fray of the spectators so that I stood exposed near the dais, too close for the liking of one of the armed guards, evidently, as he immediately jerked his attention back from the stage and stepped towards me, brandishing his halberd.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You! Get back.’</p>
<p class="indented">I held up my hands to show that I meant no harm, but unfortunately he had barked his order during a lull in the general conversation, so that a number of heads turned in my direction.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I said back,’ he repeated, louder this time; I had already retreated several paces, not wishing to draw further attention, but the man clearly wanted his royal employers to know he was doing his job, so he jabbed the weapon towards me again and I realised that the party on the dais were now peering across to see the cause of the fuss. I caught Jacopo’s eye but was unable to make any signal to him as I was distracted by the sight of Catherine de Medici staring straight at me with eyes like arrowheads. I saw her incline to her right, still watching me, and whisper to the attendant standing by her chair, a masked dwarf clad in black velvet. The dwarf bowed his head once, and promptly vanished. When he moved I noticed, among the spectators standing on the far side of the dais, the tall man with the tricorn hat and the Greek mask, his blank face fixed on me, or so it seemed; the candlelight and shadows could play tricks at that distance.</p>
<p class="indented">I was spared any further scrutiny by another commotion at the back of the hall, heralding the breathless and apologetic arrival of King Henri himself, dressed this time in more manly attire of doublet and breeches, though of a startling violet satin with legs and arms puffed. His doublet hung open to show his unlaced shirt and his cheeks were flushed, traces of white lead paint still visible in the creases of his ears and chin. He wore a purple feathered mask pushed up on to his forehead. Flinging himself into the central throne, he stretched out his long legs and leaned across to mutter to his mother, who responded with a sour look as the assembled courtiers swept off their hats and bowed to their sovereign. Henri waved a hand as if such affectation were unnecessary and pulled his mask down over his face. I was greatly relieved by his arrival, not just because he was clearly very much alive, but because I appeared to have been forgotten in the excitement.</p>
<p class="indented">I scanned the audience on both sides; most of the guests were busy in conversation, animated by drink and anticipation. There were enough cloaks and voluminous costumes among them to make it easy to hide a weapon, I thought; I had concealed one myself under my doublet. But it was too late to do anything now; the musicians struck up a new tune and servants hastily snuffed some of the candles at our end of the hall, so that all the light was concentrated on the stage where the masque was about to begin.</p>
<p class="indented">An expectant hush fell over the room. Eight young women, bare-legged, their skin gleaming with oil, in short costumes of animal skin and wearing masks intended to represent wolves and lions, danced on to the stage and proceeded to circle one another in formation, hands clawing the air to indicate ferocity. The audience emitted a low, male murmur of appreciation. The wild animals were followed by eight more girls, this time dressed as nymphs, their hair loose and woven with garlands of leaves, their gowns made of some clinging, diaphanous fabric that emphasised the curves of their thighs and breasts, so thin that the outlines of their nipples, stiff with cold, were clearly visible. The nymphs undulated down the length of the hall in the space between the two stands, towards the royal platform, weaving in and out of one another in movements carefully choreographed to give the seated spectators an uncompromising view of their bodies, before and behind. With more suggestive gyrations, the nymphs skipped prettily back towards the stage, where the lions and wolves affected to attack them, pawing unconvincingly at their clothing in a manner that clearly delighted the onlookers, to judge by the whistles and stamping that greeted this performance. Then the music shifted tempo to become slow and menacing; the nymphs stopped their frolicking and fell back into two lines, heads bowed; a breathless silence descended on the crowd, and Circe appeared.</p>
