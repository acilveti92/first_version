			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Beginning this tale is impossible without confessing that penning it is academic in nature; it will never see the light of publication. Sherlock Holmes and I are in complete agreement that the matter cannot possibly be made widely know despite the fact it featured an extraordinary client—one unlike any we had ever encountered previously—and excellent examples of my renowned friend’s powers.</p>
			<p class="bt">Even so, I find myself writing the narrative, and for an eccentric yet definite purpose. Not for <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand</span>—I should never set down in what Holmes rather waspishly terms the “promiscuous” popular accounts of his exploits anything which might harm the innocent or even unjustly malign the guilty—but for my own reasons. I will be certain to elucidate them carefully at the close of this exercise, that I might explain to Sherlock Holmes why I bothered to scribble a story no one on earth is destined to read save for the one man who wishes I would not write about him quite so assiduously. The irony is not lost upon me. But in any event, I find I cannot resist recording the opening act of the drama, representing as it does a textbook example of those qualities which serve to make my friend one of the worst fellow lodgers in London—and no less, as I shall later demonstrate paradoxically, one of the best simultaneously.</p>
			<p class="bt">Following his dramatic return from abroad, Sherlock Holmes prevailed upon me to reinstate myself at our familiar rooms in Baker Street. The man is possessed of unearthly powers of persuasion when once he sets his unparalleled mind to a project, and since I have always shared his taste for adventure and intrigue, there seemed no option more agreeable than to throw in my lot with my comrade of old. Within a night or two of sleeping in my familiar bedchamber, the leaves of the plane tree in our back area rustling a friendly homecoming welcome just beyond my window, I felt as lucky a fellow as was possible under the circumstances. My profound happiness over these incredible developments did not mean, however, that Sherlock Holmes has ever been an easy man with whom to reside. On the contrary.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens!” was all I managed to ejaculate upon my descent into our sitting room on the morning of May 26th, 1894.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes stood in the middle of the comfortable parlor wearing his dressing gown and slippers, feet wide and lean arms akimbo, aiming a medium-sized bow fitted with a steel-tipped hunter’s arrow at my writing desk several yards distant. This furnishing he had cleared of all my papers, several of which were freshly organized bills incurred in the process of moving house. They lay scattered upon the floor as if he had simply swept an arm across the surface and sent all flying helter-skelter. The documents, along with several notebooks, a fountain pen and holder, my blotting paper, and a surprisingly ample check for my recently sold home and practice, had been replaced by a haunch of cured ham which already evinced the excellent marksmanship my friend boasts in the realm of archery, with several arrows protruding from its center. Holmes is not the world’s foremost shot with a revolver, but for reasons which he has characteristically never disclosed, his skill with a bow is admirable.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do not tell me,” said I, holding both hands up as I ventured between the detective and the unfortunate piece of meat. “Allow me the dubious pleasure of guessing. You have been engaged over a case which hinges on close-range arrow shots, most probably a murder—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dear me, mistaken already. I haven’t been engaged,” Holmes interrupted, his always brusque tenor rendered stinging in his exasperation at my interference. “Lady Deborah Garry, the aunt of the notorious rake Alfred St. Edward Garry, died in an unfortunate hunting accident while I was in Montpellier. I read of it in <span class="charoverride3">Le Monde. </span>Her demise was <span class="charoverride3">not</span> an accident, however, but rather a killing of the most ruthless variety, which I am about to prove if you would only—”</p>
			<p class="bt">Crossing my arms, I continued, “After seeing that the surface of the dining table is currently occupied with our breakfast settings, and that your own worktable is still covered in the chemical study you were engaged upon yesterday, you saw fit to clear my desk of objects in the most expedient manner possible—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your grasp of the profoundly self-evident is in rare form this morning, my dear fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And now, probably because you haven’t had a case since last week, you are conducting an experiment which effectively renders <span class="charoverride3">every </span>surface of our flat unusable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That is definitively untrue, as it is being used at present.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not by me, however.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I do not dispute the fact. Watson, you’re terribly in the way.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes owns, I have remarked many times, a masterful presence. His great height would likely render this true even in the absence of his casually forceful nature, but I have never been accused of unmanly meekness, and my friend had already been trying my patience for days. My shoulders must have bristled, for his lip curled combatively.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Extend me the small courtesy of assuring me that my desk will return to its previous state, <span class="charoverride3">sans </span>any trace of ham, within the next ten minutes, and I shall happily move.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Impossible,” he scoffed, gaunt features twisting in impatience. “Detailed measurements must be taken.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Steps toward restoring my belongings must be taken.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, I have never before witnessed you obstructing the cause of justice,” he averred snappishly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Clearly my character has continued to develop quirks over time, as doubtless has your own. It is a natural phenomenon associated with aging. Pick up my things or the results of yesterday’s studies of potassium iodide are going out that window,” said I, pointing.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You wouldn’t,” he said in unfeigned horror.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Try me,” I shot back.</p>
			<p class="bt">The door of our sitting room opened after a discreet knock and Mrs. Hudson poked her head within. “There’s a gentleman to see you, Mr. Holmes. He hasn’t any card, but he says his name is Mr. Edward Phillimore, and it’s a most urgent matter, . . . Oh, heavens!”</p>
			<p class="bt">It is a testament to the marvelously phlegmatic nature of our landlady that the sight of Holmes aiming an arrow more or less in my direction earned merely a mild exclamation and an uplifted eyebrow on her part. Fiddling with the lace at her neck, she shyly ventured farther into the room.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear lady, I am presently occupied upon an experiment which has presented grievous unforeseen difficulties,” Holmes answered without turning away from me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Can I be of any help? Only I wonder whether it’s quite safe and all, Mr. Holmes, erm . . . well, <span class="charoverride3">wielding</span> such a thing indoors.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can assure you that I am a trained expert as regards the wielding, but <span class="charoverride3">distractions</span> at a juncture this critical I admit are very vexing indeed. Now, off with you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But the poor gentleman’s brother is missing, and he claims that only you can help him.” Mrs. Hudson persisted. “He is most upset.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Forgive us for startling you, Mrs. Hudson. Please send him straight up,” I requested, draping the haunch with a napkin from the table. Smiling gratefully, she turned to go, shutting the door behind her.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What the devil are you playing at? You are not the manager of my career!” Holmes exclaimed, at last setting the weapon on the sideboard.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And this is not the only set of liveable rooms in London!” I cried in my profound annoyance.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes appeared very satisfyingly shocked, grey eyes wide and mouth open upon a scathing retort I was never destined to learn. Mr. Edward Phillimore entered a few seconds later, and, after making all necessary introductions, I settled myself in my armchair to hear him out.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Edward Phillimore was indeed, as Mrs. Hudson had indicated, upset. He was a slight man, quietly dressed in a black suit with a grey waistcoat and a rounded hard felt hat with a modest charcoal band, a slender silver watch chain and a temperance pin his only ornaments, and I did not need my friend’s powers of observation to note that he had been badly shaken by the disappearance of his sibling. His hands were noticeably palsied, his general air of agitation was pronounced, and his eyes were glistening at their edges, lashes wet with distress. The poor fellow’s clothing hung a bit loose upon his frame, as if his appetite could not be roused in the absence of his missing kin and tragedy had shrunk him. He reminded me of nothing so much as a dull-coated mouse, all nerves and flat eyes and twitching, directionless energy.</p>
			<p class="bt">Rather than greeting our guest, Sherlock Holmes proceeded abruptly to snatch my papers up from the floor and arrange them into a neat pile on his own chair, a development which was as gratifying as it was unexpected and which I watched with satisfaction. He spared a mere glance at Mr. Phillimore, but his hawklike gaze sliced across his client with the cutting precision that informed me he had already reached several conclusions.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You find us somewhat disorganized this morning, Mr. Phillimore. Apologies. I am presently engaged upon a matter of some importance and thus can spare you but limited time for consultation. Therefore, consult. Aside from the evident facts that you are a bachelor, an importer of Kashmiri silks, a teetotaler, and an identical twin, I know very little of the matter you are here to discuss.”</p>
			<p class="bt">For a moment, I thought Mr. Phillimore looked so surprised as to be physically ill. His brow glowed with sweat following this remark, and his lips gaped in fishlike wonderment, which caused my less than tactful friend to snort mildly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come, come. Your marital status and your aversion to strong spirits I know from the ring finger of your left hand and your lapel pin.” Holmes commenced retrieving my notebooks as I stared, mesmerized at the sight of him actually tidying—a miraculous enough development apart from the fact he was doing so in front of a client. “The rest of my deductions about your case are frankly meretricious, as I learned them in the <span class="charoverride3">Daily Telegraph</span> this morning. Your thriving importation business—Phillimore, Saxon, and Greer Textiles, I think it was—has recently been helmed by your partners while you conduct a widespread search for your missing twin, Mr. James Phillimore, and that estimable publication provided me with no further details as to your conundrum.”</p>
			<p class="bt">A pause followed this address. “Pray continue from there, if you would be so kind,” I urged as my friend wandered the carpet gathering scattered pens. “You have our full attention.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Our guest swallowed with difficulty, pressing his hands together hard enough to mask the shaking. “You must help me, Mr. Holmes. I am at the end of my wits. My brother James and I reside together—and, as you say, we are identical in nearly every fashion. Our establishment is a bachelor one, but happy and peaceful for all that, for I am of retiring habits and find myself entirely contented with the simple comforts of work and family. Three days ago, James departed our residence in Enfield Town, Middlesex. Upon realizing at once that the fineness of the morning would likely not last through the afternoon, he prudently returned for his umbrella. Since that time, no one has seen him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend had moved on to restoring my ink pot and blotting papers to their rightful home, so I continued in my self-appointed role as interlocutor.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Remarkable,” I said sympathetically. “You are obviously close—it is small wonder that his unexplained absence has so affected you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The anxiety over him, the dreadful uncertainty . . . Mr. Holmes, I can bear it no longer!” Mr. Phillimore cried in a blatant bid for a scrap of the detective’s consideration. “The maid, a most reliable and careful girl, is prepared to swear that she witnessed him leaving as she watched through the parlor window where she was clearing away the breakfast things. She offered him his umbrella on his immediate return, left him in the foyer consulting his Bradshaw, and did not hear the outer door close again. Indeed, she shut and locked it herself after feeling a queer draft some quarter of an hour later. My brother has vanished utterly, Mr. Holmes, and I find myself a lost man.” He drew a deep breath, eyes shutting despairingly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Where were you at the time?” my friend questioned, casually hoisting what appeared to be a gigantic napkin-draped pincushion, transferring his ham from my desk to a space he had cleared upon the dining table. Had Mr. Phillimore’s circumstances been less distressing, I am sure I would have struggled not to laugh.</p>
			<p class="bt">“At my importation firm in Stepney. Mr. Holmes, please say that you will take my case,” the unfortunate man begged. “My brother is . . . he is not altogether well. I fear that some of his habits have led to dissolution in the past, and at present, it pains me grievously to think that he quit the house in some undiscovered manner and met with misadventure. The thought quite horrifies me. It is <span class="charoverride3">most</span> unlike him to keep me in the dark in this fashion. I have always been the steady one, and James has had reason to bless my generosity previously. But we have ever reconciled despite our differences, have never flagged in our devotion to each other, and I cannot stand to imagine that one of his former associates caused him physical harm.” Choking, Mr. Edward Phillimore pulled out his handkerchief.</p>
			<p class="bt">To my severely stifled amusement, Holmes had by this time actually polished the surface of my desk with his own kerchief and had swiveled to sit upon it, lighting his pipe. The effect of his new client’s heartfelt devastation was sobering to say the least, however, for both of us, and he fixed his eyes on our visitor with focus regained.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Habits, you say,” my friend commented delicately, in that engaging manner he could switch to with such readiness when once a client had gained his goodwill. “I fear I must ask you to elaborate on your twin’s foibles, Mr. Phillimore, if you believe they could prove of any ultimate use to me in finding him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The poor man winced gamely. “I would do anything to locate him, even if it means ruining his already soiled reputation. Where to begin? James gambles and loses to dangerous parties. Perhaps that is the most perilous aspect. He drinks to excess. I have known him to experiment with opiates in the past. His taste in women is both unwise and indiscreet. For a time, he kept a mistress who worked in a low music hall. Please do not think ill of him for his past trespasses, but given the situation at hand, I hardly know what to think, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are very right to explore all avenues. Was he in the midst of a crisis when he vanished?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not of which I was aware. James has been far steadier of late before this altogether unprecedented disappearance. I had thought him quite recovered from his previous licentiousness. Or at least . . . he gave me cause for hope.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But as you’ve admitted, you could easily be mistaken. Are you in contact with any of his companions in infamy?” Holmes persisted, studying the ceiling.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I’ve made efforts in that direction, fearing the worst. They are hardly to be trusted at the best of times, but they have revealed nothing these three days—not to me, nor to the Yard. I feel as if I am suffocating in this complete darkness, Mr. Holmes. I can neither sleep nor eat nor conduct my business with any mindfulness. My brother imagined it might rain and he evaporated into the clear blue,” Mr. Phillimore said with a bone-racking shudder.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s really rather piquant, isn’t it?” Holmes directed at me with the sinister air of enjoyment he is so seldom capable of hiding.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Sudden disappearances are not generally characterized as ‘piquant,’ ” I reminded him.</p>
			<p class="bt">To anyone else, Holmes might have appeared unmoved, but I could see a hint of chagrin tighten his stark features. “Quite. Why haven’t you calling cards, Mr. Phillimore?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Calling cards? Why, my fresh order is at the printer’s and in my distress, I have not yet secured it.” The afflicted man’s eyes teared once more. “Please will you agree to help me, Mr. Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Indeed, I will. You may rely upon my full energies being devoted to your cause. After breakfast.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Had Holmes sprouted wings and taken flight, he could not have stunned me any more than he did with this implication that he thought an intriguing case of secondary importance to a meal being consumed, and I believe my eyebrows expressed this sentiment.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Give me your address,” Holmes ordered, writing it upon his shirt-cuff with one of the pens he had just retrieved from the floor. “Very well. We shall see you in Middlesex in a few hours, Mr. Phillimore, and during that time, I should like for you to cudgel your brains over any relevant details you may have accidentally omitted. Good morning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">With that, the quivering supplicant departed, and I regarded Sherlock Holmes with a silent yet determined gaze I calculated would bear more fruit than direct interrogation. It did so, and more quickly than I had dared to hope.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It doesn’t quite wash, you see.” Holmes tore two pillows from his armchair and collapsed full length upon the bearskin, threading his slim fingers behind his head as he continued to smoke languidly. “Supposing we had accompanied him, I shouldn’t have had time to work out why and could have botched matters spectacularly, despite your habit of painting me with an unduly flattering brush. Anyhow, it will give you time to consume an egg or two. If you’d do me the favor of not speaking for the interim . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Gladly,” I responded, going to the table after casting a satisfied glance over my restored writing desk.</p>
			<p class="bt">I was not destined to assist Sherlock Holmes by keeping my peace on this occasion, however. The thunderous steps preceding the equally stormy arrival of an unannounced visitor caused me—as a man whose alertness had not faltered since my friend’s near-strangulation at Colonel Sebastian Moran’s hands—to freeze upon a pin’s head, directing my frame at the opening door. The face which confronted us when it flew open was an unforgettable one. His eyes were slit with serpentine cunning, his form fat and yet wan with unhealthy pallor—altogether, an unpleasant walking threat of a man wearing loudly checked brown trousers with a florid scarlet necktie and a devious smirk that canted unevenly across his visage. He reminded me of a bloated species of maggot, and my posture reflected this association.</p>
			<p class="bt">“All right, then, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he declared upon arrival, staring down with bald-faced contempt at my friend’s unlikely position on the carpet. “My name is Atlantus B. Conger, and I’ve a meaty bone to pick with you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How unfortunate,” my friend drawled, tilting his head as he studied the intruder. “On both counts.”</p>
			<p class="bt">For the second time that morning, I found myself edging between Sherlock Holmes and an object of distaste. “State your business, sir, without hesitation, as we are better accustomed to our visitors making prearranged appointments.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Thrusting a poorly manicured finger at Holmes, Atlantus B. Conger announced, “You’ve been engaged to find James Phillimore. That sniveling worm of a brother consulted you. Well, I want to know what you’ve been told and I want to know if you’ll play straight with me when you do learn more, you savvy?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I do,” Holmes assured him, closing his eyes as if too overwhelmed by tedium to remain awake. He flitted a lazy hand toward the stairs. “Mr. Conger, I invite you to rekindle your acquaintance with the door.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, is that how it is?” the brute snarled, clenching a thick fist which—though doughlike—had doubtless seen its share of violent activity, for it was scarred and scabrous. “I’ll have you know that James Phillimore has recently frequented my establishment, proved himself a bit heavy-handed at cards, and presently owes me three hundred and twenty-nine pounds.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a tremendous pity.” Holmes took a delicate sip from his pipe. “Your establishment, you say? I take it to be the variety of establishment where guests are invited to part with all their earnings, since I frankly cannot imagine any of the honest private clubs or gambling halls being owned by a former bare-knuckle boxer wearing quite that shade of cravat. The pugilism might pass, granted, but as for the choice in neckwear . . .” He angled a brow. “Unthinkable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My little den is as honest as it needs to be and I’ll thank you to watch that mouth of yours,” Conger snarled.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, yes, the proprietors of all the finest betting enclaves charge unannounced into unrelated gentlemen’s homes during the breakfast hour.” Holmes rolled his eyes, a movement which in his supine position directed them at the fireplace.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Put on all the airs you like, you arrogant toff, that don’t change the fact of his owing me—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Three hundred and twenty-nine pounds, yes. You mentioned it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You can bet your last tanner I did! Add to that figure some ten quid for all the poppy of mine he’s smoked and I’m out three hundred and thirty-nine pounds through no fault saving my own generous nature.”</p>
			<p class="bt">A bright smile briefly illuminated Holmes’s sober features. “Dear me! Someone has taught it arithmetic.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Christ, that’s enough of your lip. Are you actually this keen to have your head stove in, or just too thick to know when you’ve met your match? I’ve broken better men than you,” the card sharp’s oddly asymmetrical mouth spat.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t believe you have,” I demurred, planting my feet.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes, pipe frozen between the empty teacup he had appropriated as its resting place and his mouth, leveled a look at me which might almost have been mistaken for fondness in men who indulge in such sentiments.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Conger, allow me to sum up,” he murmured, yawning in a manner that caused the villain’s chaotic array of teeth to grind. “You have hosted Mr. James Phillimore at your doubtless highly refined and tasteful gaming parlor, plied him with opiates, and his debts are now onerous to you. You disavow to me hereby that you had anything whatsoever to do with his disappearance, am I correct? I suppose you rather slower than many other thugs of your stripe, but not so dense that you would consult me over a murder you actually <span class="charoverride3">committed.</span> Very well—should I locate Mr. James Phillimore, and find him in a condition to settle his outstanding obligations, I shall encourage him to do the decent, provided you pledge in return your full cooperation as regards my investigation. Please bear in mind that, should you fail to be truthful with me, I will enjoy crushing you—that is, supposing my friend Dr. Watson here doesn’t get to you first. If your claims are honorable, I can at least assure you that I will not keep my own findings a secret. Now, quit the premises.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The entire affair could have gone very ill at that moment. However, seething, the scoundrel growled a curse and did as he was asked, slamming the door behind him and causing my newly reinstated portrait of General Gordon to rattle in its frame. Where he had before looked thoughtful, now Sherlock Holmes appeared so introspective I might almost have called him anxious, tapping his pipe stem against his lip before carefully returning it to the porcelain.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It appears that Mr. James Phillimore had reason to disappear after all. Are we likely to have any trouble?” I asked as I sat down, drawing an egg holder closer along with a spoon.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No,” Holmes answered, frowning. “But I don’t care for it, I confess to you. This is a darker matter than merely vanishing in such an extraordinary fashion.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I did not understand him, and thus a brief silence followed. When Holmes rolled his head in my direction and viewed me calmly slicing a thin piece of cured ham from his former target to accompany my egg, he laughed so heartily in his uniquely noiseless manner that camaraderie at once overtopped every other petty consideration, and I found myself chuckling helplessly at my as-yet-untouched plate.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And to think that everyone assumes I am the mad one,” he reflected, making a rueful clucking sound.</p>
			<p class="bt">“As the cat said to Alice, we are all mad here.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, our regrettably obnoxious visitor has cleared my mind somewhat.” Holmes sprang to his feet, smoothing his dark hair back into orderliness. “Hurry and eat. I must dress. We must go.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll just look up the trains to Middlesex,” I agreed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“To Stepney,” he corrected me as he flew through the door of his bedroom.</p>
			<p class="btspace">“Describe Mr. Phillimore?” Mr. Timothy Greer, partner at the small and plain but seemingly bustling firm of Phillimore, Saxon, and Greer Textiles, repeated following my friend’s request.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes had taken us with seemingly undue haste to Stepney, apparently to interview our client’s closest colleague, Mr. Greer. He was a spherical gentleman with the sort of open, generous bearing and healthy complexion which makes some lucky fellows seem far younger than their years, and well dressed, with the single rather theatrical addition of a maroon velvet waistcoat. Of course, surrounded in the warehouse by brilliant imported silks draped over dressers’ models and folded into the semblance of curtains on broad cutters’ tables, a single colorful vest was less likely to provide any visual impact. Mr. Greer appeared eager to please despite the ongoing need for his supervision around his hectic workplace, waving us over to a more private alcove equipped with a set of armchairs as my friend explained himself.</p>
			<p class="bt">“One never knows when seeking a second opinion may prove invaluable, you see,” Holmes expounded. “Multiple interviews allow the investigator to gain a clearer perception of the world which gave birth to the point of crisis, like an archaeologist sifting through shards. I may not know what each fragment means until I have slotted them into their rightful places, but when all is reassembled, the picture of Rome’s fall grows far more complete.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your imagery is most disturbing, sir. You think this a true emergency, then—that some tragedy has befallen James?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I did not say so, but cases of sudden disappearance demand we leave no stone unturned. And siblings are all too often rather blinded by intimate proximity. There may be aspects of his brother’s life that my client would have balked at relating in any salient detail. If you would be so kind, start from the beginning and tell me everything you can about Mr. Phillimore.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course.” The room was close despite its size, and Mr. Greer swiped his brow with an elegant flick of his kerchief as we all seated ourselves. “Anything I can do for the cause. I confess myself gratified to learn that you were called in, Mr. Holmes. The missing man—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, but—I beg your pardon—I was not referring to Mr. James Phillimore,” Holmes objected, to my surprise, holding up a single finger. “If you would be so kind as to describe Mr. Edward Phillimore, however, your partner in the silk trade, I should be much obliged to you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My business partner?” Mr. Greer again repeated, seeming as puzzled as I was. “The man who consulted you this morning?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, quite so. Your partner Mr. Edward Phillimore seemed most distressed, and if the severity of his agitation could possibly have any bearing upon the case, it would behoove me to know of it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely you don’t doubt his honest concern?” Mr. Greer exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“On the contrary, his anxiety appeared entirely justified. But imagine that you are speaking to an expert in evaluating works of fine art. If I am to identify a painting as a hitherto undiscovered Andrea del Sarto, I must examine every brushstroke, every nuanced choice of pigmentation. I promise you that describing Mr. Edward Phillimore can only assist me in locating Mr. James Phillimore.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Because they are twins, and therefore so much in tune?” Mr. Greer wondered, his face clearing.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps,” Holmes agreed cordially.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Certainly I will do all I’m able, and you are right in thinking them exceedingly alike. Well, then . . . Mr. Edward Phillimore is a very steady, hardworking sort, but with a delicate constitution and a general air of extreme anxiety. It does not go unnoticed by strangers, and therefore it falls to me to fulfill many of the firm’s more social obligations. This affliction has haunted him since his youth, I regret to say—he was bullied dreadfully at school, or so I have gathered from melancholy hints, and his personality never regained that boisterous confidence so particular to free-spirited youth. In many ways, despite his good nature and his competence, Edward is a haunted man.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Apart from shyness, did his work suffer by this tendency toward fretfulness?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Never—as a matter of fact, on the contrary, Mr. Holmes. Edward is remarkably conscientious, and I should point out that this exactitude leads to the most gratifying care over his own affairs while failing to enter the realm of hardness toward others’ shortcomings. The man is no callous moralist. He is most devoted to his missing twin, for instance, and Mr. James Phillimore . . . I hesitate to say it, sir, but I am not entirely surprised at his uncanny absence. In his younger years, he was a dissolute character indeed, and Edward has multiple times been the saving of him during his direst lapses. Opium, drink, reckless wagers—his history is an extremely colorful one.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So we were given to believe.” Holmes tapped the arm of his chair with spindly fingers. “Might I venture to surmise that Edward’s devotion to the temperance cause stems from these cautionary experiences?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Without question. He is most passionate on the subject and wears the emblem of the organization daily.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, I noted as much when he called upon me. Do you know of any particular incidents which might have left James open to blackmail attempts? Vices which fell upon the wrong side of the law?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, I couldn’t say, Mr. Holmes.” Mr. Greer frowned as if regretful he could think of nothing more sordid to relate. “But Edward was always worrying over him, so I’d not rule out the possibility. It hurts me not to give his sibling a better character, but then again, neither could Edward were he sitting here in my stead.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Despite the inevitable strain caused by James’s destructive tendencies, was Mr. Edward Phillimore right to characterize their relationship as a close one?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“They are loyal to one another entirely, sir, even when the missing sibling is at his lowest ebb. I hate to picture Edward’s state if anything has truly happened to James—it is as if each were only half-formed before birth, the reckless and vice-ridden one existing to be the other half of his esteemed counterpart. Have you ever read <span class="charoverride3">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,</span> Mr. Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, but surely you don’t mean to imply that there was but one Phillimore brother?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No indeed, but that was the way they acted—mirroring one another. I know it sounds fanciful, but there is often such intimacy between twins, though I have never before witnessed such dichotomy.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes pressed his finger along the edge of his arched brow, an innocuous gesture which I knew signaled grave concern. “Was either of the brothers inclined to fits of violent temper? You have mentioned that Edward struggled with despondency and nagging worriment. If his brother were ever threatened, does he seem the sort who might take matters into his own hands?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Heavens, Mr. Holmes, I cannot imagine such a thing. I’m sure he has always acted according to his conscience in all the many years we’ve been acquainted. And yet . . .” Mr. Greer paused. “Were James in danger, I can think of no lengths to which Edward would not go to protect his only kin.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Naturally not. One final question. When Mr. Edward Phillimore took his leave in order to seek out his missing brother three days ago, did he call round in person to tell you the news?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why . . . well, come to think of it, no. He sent a wire. You are sure there is no further detail on which I can satisfy you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I rather think that will be all. You have illuminated much, Mr. Greer.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes thanked the affable Mr. Greer efficiently and we quit the silk warehouse for the briny air of London’s busiest maritime district, surrounded by unadorned manufactories and glum tenements housing the families which scraped out a living from the frenzied commercial hive engulfing them. My friend, to my bemusement, seemed grimly satisfied by the previous conversation. He turned to me with a statement on his lips, hesitated, shook his head, and set off in search of a cab.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes, what is the matter? Mr. Greer just confirmed what we already know in every particular,” I pointed out as he whistled at an approaching driver. “He may as well have painted us an exact portrait of Edward Phillimore as he appeared in our sitting room this morning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I know,” admitted Holmes. “Which profoundly worries me.”</p>
			<p class="btspace">Enfield is justly credited for its meadows, its lush greenery, its sixteenth-century palace, and the charm of its local markets, but since the arrival of the railway’s branch line, it has become a haven for all the plentiful folk who wish to find useful employment in London and are willing to submit themselves to a daily journey. Having just quit the filthy cacophony of Stepney, I could see the immediate advantage in sacrificing time for a suitable living space. The air was sweeter, the houses were neat and cleanly, and the very daylight seemed the more wholesome in the absence of London’s grim atmospheric shroud.</p>
			<p class="bt">After knocking, we were shown into a nicely arranged sitting room which eccentrically boasted a wide array of brilliant Kashmiri silks every­where draped over furnishings and employed as wall hangings. The effect was, if a bit exuberant, decidedly cheerful, and further buoyed by a variety of sleek-leafed potted plants. A marmalade cat curled in a beam of sunshine at the edge of the settee, and despite the bachelor nature of the establishment, friendly domesticity suffused the chamber. Yet something in the air was amiss, the absent twin’s presence seeming to hover just out of sight in the reflections of portrait glass and the shadows of imperfectly closed doorways.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Edward Phillimore sat at a claw-footed writing desk, studying accounts. He glanced up when we approached, the gleam of renewed hope momentarily brightening his features. When Holmes removed his silk hat with all the sobriety of a physician making a tragic house call, the glad spark was replaced by a grimace.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Phillimore, I have only one question to put to you, but I must beg you to answer it truthfully,” my friend said in the peculiarly gentle tone he reserves for those who are much affected by neuroses but with whom he sympathizes.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes?” Mr. Phillimore replied, lips quivering.</p>
			<p class="bt">“How did your brother, Mr. Edward Phillimore, die?”</p>
			<p class="bt">I was shocked, my eyes flying first to my friend and then to his piteous client. The effect this blunt but kindly delivered query had upon our new acquaintance was most alarming. His already writhing features collapsed, and he half-fell forward onto the desk with a piteous sob. I averted my gaze in pained silence, but Holmes continued staring with the same intense focus he devotes to all unique specimens, be they human or otherwise. After a few seconds, however, he approached his client and gripped him firmly by the shoulder.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come,” said he, as commanding as ever. “I cannot blame you for expressing your sorrow, but I can assure you that I’ve no desire to add to your woes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“God, I am the last man on earth to deserve your mercy, sir, but I daresay no one has greater need of it.” Mr. James Phillimore dropped his forearms and sat shakily staring at damp palms. “Oh, what you must think of me!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My friend Watson here will tell you that I’ve my own peculiar definitions when it comes to wrongdoing. If there has been but a single crime committed—that of perjury, which is what I suspect occurred—then after you have made your case to us, I will act as my conscience dictates rather than by the letter of the law, which in my experience can include a bit too much of the alphabet. Now, then! Bear up, man, I cannot be of any assistance otherwise. Oh, very well, shall I tell it to you myself? Your clothing, while nearly fitting your thinner form, instead belonged to your late brother, a man who by all accounts was a most upstanding gentleman. And Edward Phillimore was reportedly plagued by an anxious character, but you are instead suffering from opium withdrawal.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My amazement at Sherlock Holmes’s revelation was echoed upon the face of the unmasked James Phillimore, who straightened his shoulders and managed a definite nod. My friend rounded the desk and sat in the chair before it, crossing his legs and adopting an air of blank neutrality.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I take it you have seen the signs before,” Mr. James Phillimore murmured, eyes downcast in shame.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes—agitation, spasms, palsy, abundant tearing, et cetera—all of which you displayed at Baker Street; and a stronger hint was given me in Stepney.” Holmes directed an abstracted gaze at the Turkey carpet as he reflected, perhaps in a belated effort to spare his client further distress. “Stop me if I go astray, but I believe I’ve all the threads in my hand. You had reformed your scandalous habits for a time, but continued secretly to nurse an opium addiction which you could not seem to shake off; stronger men than yourself have succumbed to the poppy habit. Three days ago, you relapsed still further into old errors, falling into the debt of Mr. Atlantus B. Conger—a regrettable sort of person in every particular.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How can you know that?” Mr. Phillimore demanded, raising his head.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I earn my bread and cheese by knowing what most do not know. I cannot do more than surmise as to what passed between you and your brother Edward when you arrived home after your spree, however, so you must assist us on that count.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Shivering, Mr. James Phillimore answered Holmes in a wracked whisper. “I was barely aware when I arrived home—for days I had been using myself wretchedly, drinking and playing at cards only to reach for the pipe and fall into soft dreams when I could no longer see straight, staggering between the tables and the cots Conger keeps for revelers on a binge. My brother, God rest him, went through my pockets after finding me in a state of helpless stupor upon the settee. The only item he discovered out of the usual was a note indicating I owed this scoundrel Conger well over three hundred pounds. My twin . . . Oh, heaven save me,” he gasped, attempting to wrench himself back into control.</p>
			<p class="bt">“He was shocked, doubtless.” Holmes said slowly. “He took the news as a blow to the pair of you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Edward was always delicate of constitution. He had nursed a weak heart for many years. And the sum mentioned . . . We are not rich bachelors, Mr. Holmes, though we live well enough between his importation firm and my own work as a solicitor’s clerk. We cannot afford to reside in London, as you see. We have debts. The house is in need of repairs. You can imagine the picture I am painting—setting these concerns atop his heartbreak over my complete relapse, the amount quite broke him. When I awoke in the small hours, my sibling was dead of nervous prostration, and it was at my hands and mine alone.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When Mr. Phillimore again collapsed into weeping, Holmes said quietly, “Which leads us to the crime. It was the middle of the night, with no servants afoot to distract you from your mad idea or to hamper you in its execution. You have met unsavory types in your wild spells. You contacted some of them and requested that they arrange to bury your brother in secret. I have no doubt that you paid a pretty penny for these denizens of the underworld, whoever they were, to whisk your brother’s remains away from this house with no one the wiser, as it is the only possible explanation for events as they later unfolded. So—you called for help, and they took Edward away to his final resting place before dawn. Did you deliver him into the hands of anatomical scavengers? Or was the ceremony a legitimate one?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I would never have dishonored Edward’s remains!” the stricken man cried. “Not on my own life, Mr. Holmes! It was in the wrong parish with the wrong name, but . . . yes, all else was aboveboard, though it cost me dearly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then no crime which need concern me has been in fact committed . . . yet,” Holmes concluded with a sharp look at Mr. James Phillimore. “After your twin’s stealthy burial, you dressed as yourself and left the house, immediately returning for your umbrella and being very careful that the maid should see and remember your doing so. You then went upstairs and simply donned your twin’s attire, and the switch was complete. Thereafter, it must have been an easy matter to escape your residence undetected, and you reappeared as Edward when you returned. My hat is off to you for a truly ingenious and remarkable ploy, though similar substitutions have taken place in Plymouth and Limoges. After the initial deception succeeded, you wired Phillimore, Saxon, and Greer to say that you were searching for James and could not return to work until he was found. Your only true mistake was to forget to carry his calling cards, an oversight no conscientious man of business would make. My sole remaining question is . . . what do you plan to do with the rest of your life, Mr. Phillimore?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Our client dashed a cloth over his eyes, nodding.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have borrowed heavily at a usurious rate, but plan to repay Mr. Conger this afternoon,” he replied in a rasping voice. “My purpose in delaying my arrival at the textile concern was to thoroughly learn the accounts and pore over my brother’s records. Edward was a better man than I will ever . . . the best man I . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">Finding he could not continue on this topic, James Phillimore struck his fist violently against the desk. “James Phillimore is dead, Mr. Holmes, and I set you an impossible task that you might prove so to the authorities should they ever question me. Who could doubt I had done all I could to find him when I took the trouble of calling in the renowned Sherlock Holmes? I am sorry to have deceived you, but my anguish was real. I will repay my debts, I will mend my ways, and I mean to honor his name by being the best Edward Phillimore of which I am capable. That is my plan, Mr. Holmes—for the good son to live on, and for the prodigal who was forgiven in vain so many times to die in obscurity.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend considered this for several dragging seconds, faint lines of worriment etched along his high brow. Then he nodded, stood, and returned his black hat to his head. “Come, Watson,” said he, and we departed the brilliantly jewel-toned house of grief.</p>
			<p class="bt">Once we were outside, my friend turned to me, catching me by the arm.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You disapprove?” he asked, brows plunging together.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not in the least,” said I, as certain of that fact as I have ever been of anything.</p>
			<p class="bt">Pursing his lips, Holmes added, “Not everyone is given the opportunity to return from the dead, and to grow better than he was before to boot. You mentioned earlier . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">He stopped, giving a small, distressed cough, looking as exasperated as I have ever seen my aloof comrade. Holmes’s square chin was tense with frustration, and his entire thin form uncharacteristically rigid. Understanding, I smiled, and steered us in the direction of the railway station.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Baker Street is not the only set of liveable rooms in London, but it is certainly the most desirable to me personally,” I assured him. “And if you read about yourself in <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand,</span> then you must already know that I never imagined you any better than you were in the first place.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes, ignoring me in favor of checking his pocket watch and muttering something about trains, thankfully seemed to believe what I had told him, for he dropped the topic. And on the next occasion this often extremely trying gentleman forgets the salient fact that my admiration for him is not affected by his myriad eccentricities, I shall hand over this unpublishable manuscript, since he apparently from time to time ignores evidence which is every bit as clear as a printed magazine page.</p>
