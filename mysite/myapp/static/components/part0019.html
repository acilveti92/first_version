				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The sun was high in the sky, but the water was cold. It lapped up to Jack’s shoulders, soaking the gold braid on the front of his hussar’s dolman so that he was dragged forward. Had it been any deeper, it would likely have pulled him under.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t let that get wet, Mr Fenris.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack forced his arms straight, holding the heavy portmanteau as high above his head as his aching arms would allow. Palmer laboured along behind him, grunting with the effort of carrying a pair of small leather trunks, one balanced on each of his broad shoulders. A heavy splash further back told Jack that his new commanding officer had followed his small staff into the surf.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The landings had been going on for several hours before the three men of the army’s intelligence department had been called forward to clamber down the thick rope net and into the small pinnacle that would ferry them closer to the shore. They would be leaving the comforts of the steam frigate <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Feroze</span> behind, swapping their comfortable berths for the wild open countryside of Persia. At least that was how Ballard had described it to Jack the previous evening as they contemplated their departure. Jack had done his best not to snort in derision. They would be serving on the staff. The only hardships they were likely to endure were the heat and the insects. They would not be expected to fight, nor would they be forced to sleep on the ground without the protection of a tent. Staff officers lived cheek by jowl with the men who would do the fighting, but their conditions were a thousand leagues above the hardship they expected the common redcoats to tolerate without murmur.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British troops were coming ashore at Hallila Bay, around twelve miles south of the town of Bushire, one of the early objectives of the campaign. One full division had been dispatched with the task of enforcing Great Britain’s will. Command of the expeditionary force had fallen to Major General Foster Stalker, an officer who had enjoyed a satisfactory, if not spectacular, career in the East India Company’s army, most recently commanding the 2nd Bombay European Regiment. At his disposal he had five battalions of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, two batteries of field artillery, one of horse artillery and two companies of the Bombay Sappers and Miners. Drawn from the troops around Bombay, the small army was already a close-knit group, with many of the officers well known to one another.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Their orders were simple: teach the Shah that to flout British influence was to court disaster.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack lifted his head and looked ashore. The air above the beach seemed to shimmer, the haze created by the heat blurring his view. The promise of the warmth to come sustained him as he struggled towards the sand, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he lumbered through the cold water. Despite the haze, he could see enough to understand that the division was disembarking in a calm and ordered fashion, with none of the chaos he had expected. The British landings in the Crimea had been a near disaster, the army thrown into the campaign in a display of utter mismanagement. It was clear that the Indian navy would not tolerate such standards on their watch.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As he stumbled through the surf, Jack could see the ranks of red-coated soldiers marching away from the landing area, heading towards their assigned bivouacs inland. Gunboats hovered in the bay, prowling backwards and forwards as they protected the exposed troops. The sailors had already been called into action. Some three to four hundred enemy troops had been waiting to contest the British landing, formed up in a grove of date trees around two hundred yards to the left of the beach. From their position they would have been able to pour a withering fire down on the heads of the first men coming ashore. Such resistance would have made the landings a bloody affair. The soldiers would have had to wade in from the small boats that brought them from the transports, enduring the enemy fire without being able to fight back until they were fully ashore. The casualties would have been horrendous.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fortunately, the keen eyes of the young officers on the gunboats had spotted the Persian force. It had not taken long for them to engage the enemy, and their bombardment had scattered the waiting troops, killing dozens in the process. Jack had watched the attack from the comfort of the <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Feroze</span>. At the time, he had applauded the calm demonstration of skill by the naval officers, a welcome spectacle for the soldiers waiting to go ashore. Now he was no more than one hundred yards from the target of the barrage, and he felt the shame of having joined in the celebratory cheers as other men had been dying and suffering on the receiving end of the cannon fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He staggered out of the last of the surf and trudged through the soft sand, grateful to feel the power of the sun after the chill of the water. He saw the scorch marks where the navy shells had landed. The date grove had been destroyed by the well-directed fire, the trees shredded. The ground was littered with bodies and abandoned equipment and the smell of smoke and spilt blood caught at the back of his throat. It had been months since he had last fought, and it churned his stomach to once again witness the destructive power of battle. Some of the corpses had been literally torn apart, whilst others lay in the grotesque and twisted positions of death. He forced his eyes away from the macabre sight and stepped around a puddle of vomit. Clearly he had not been the only one affected by what he saw.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good man, Jack, let’s choose a place to set up, shall we?’ Major Ballard marched past, the water cascading from his soaked uniform. If the commander of the intelligence department was concerned at seeing the first enemy casualties of the campaign, he gave no sign of it.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack traipsed after the major, using both hands to haul the portmanteau up the beach. Like the rest of the officers and men, the staff of the intelligence department carried the very minimum they needed. It would be some days before any of the heavier baggage could come ashore, so the troops marched without tents and with just three days’ rations in their haversacks. Jack and Palmer had been forced to carry the other items that Major Ballard deemed essential; judging by the weight of the bag Jack had lugged ashore, they consisted mainly of bulging ledgers and thick sheaves of papers. Quite why he required the contents of a small library in the earliest days of the campaign was beyond Jack’s comprehension, but he had long ago learned not to fight the whims of a senior officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The stove spluttered as it lit. The fowl stew had been a gift from a lieutenant in the 2nd Bombay Light Infantry who had come ashore in the first wave and who had sensibly carried a fowling rifle with him. It spoke of Ballard’s standing that he had been given a share of the precious pot, and Jack was beginning to sense that he was fortunate to be connected with the cadaverous major.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s a marvellous thing, is it not?’ Ballard poked the contents of the pan with the end of his pocket knife.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am looking forward to tasting it.’ Jack’s stomach growled as the aroma of the stew wafted his way. ‘Should we save some for Palmer?’ He had barely spoken to Ballard’s burly bodyguard, yet it would not do to forget the man. Jack was keen to get the other half of Ballard’s staff on side, but the major had dispatched his enforcer on an errand. He had not thought fit to tell Jack where or why.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am not talking about the stew, Jack, I doubt that will taste of anything much at all.’ Ballard sniffed as he contemplated the bubbling mixture. It was becoming clear that the major had little time for food. He rarely ate, preferring to spend time reading the dozens of reports that came across his desk. It explained his sparse frame. ‘In answer to your question, yes, I think we should save some for Palmer; the man eats like a veritable horse and we cannot possibly consume all this by ourselves. But I was referring to the stove, not to this concoction.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack wondered at the mind of a man who could ignore a hot meal when faced with a night without shelter from the elements. ‘It is a fine thing.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fine indeed!’ Ballard clearly did not share Jack’s opinion. ‘It is not <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">fine</span>, it is a marvel of modern engineering. It is a wonder that a Frenchman could have designed such a device. It takes but a morsel of combustible material, yet it produces the very maximum amount of output. Monsieur Soyer is a genius, and he is quite correct to name this a “Magic Stove”.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was learning a great deal about Ballard’s character. He was not interested in food, yet the machine that could cook it fascinated him. ‘I wish we’d had these in the Crimea.’ He shivered as he remembered the misery of the first nights of the campaign that had led to the terrific bloodletting at the Alma river.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard looked up sharply. ‘You fought in the Crimea? Where? At the siege?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack scowled at his thoughtless remark. ‘No, I was lucky. I missed that.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The major would not let him off the hook so easily. ‘So before that, then? At the Alma?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Did you fight?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It was a bloody affair, I hear.’ Ballard was watching Jack closely. He frowned. ‘You could not have been Arthur Fenris in the Crimea. He would have been with the 24th at that time.’ His frown deepened as he realised he did not know all of Jack’s story. ‘You must have been someone else.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack decided it would be best to steer the conversation away from his past. ‘That looks done, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard poked the thickened stew with his knife. ‘You might well be right.’ He leant forward and twisted the control knob on the stove, shutting off the heat that was condensed from the enclosed burner and channelled into the stove itself. ‘Please help yourself.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack did not need to be asked twice. He reached for the pan and started to eat. He was well into his third mouthful when he noticed Ballard staring at him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Will you tell me your story?’ The major sat cross-legged on the ground, still watching Jack intently. ‘The rest of it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You know most of it already.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘But clearly not all.’ Ballard leant forward and swirled his knife around the stew. He extracted a thick nugget of flesh that he inspected carefully before gingerly nibbling at one edge.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. Not all of it.’ Jack gave the admission grudgingly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Does anyone? Does anyone know the full story of Jack Lark, the infamous charlatan?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No. Only me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That must be a burden,’ Ballard said softly. He paused, looking at Jack closely before he spoke again. ‘You scream in your sleep. I heard you on the ship.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He had shared a cabin with his commander on the <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Feroze</span>, but he had not gained the first indication that he had disturbed the major’s rest. He felt his cheeks flush, the intimacy of Ballard’s words disconcerting. ‘You’re lucky; <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">you</span> sleep like a bloody baby.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard looked straight into Jack’s eyes, as if searching them for knowledge. ‘That is the benefit of a clear conscience. Perhaps that is something you lack.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack saved himself from replying by filling his mouth, something he immediately regretted as the hot mixture scalded his tongue. He was surprised at Ballard’s insight, but he had learnt never to share his memories, no matter how tempting. He would keep his past to himself.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So what next? What would you have me do?’ Jack asked the question gruffly when his mouth was emptied, breaking the closeness that had been building between them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard snorted, but did not press further. ‘It will take us one day to prepare to march, I imagine. Stalker landed this afternoon. He is an eager man and will be keen to get on before the powers-that-be decide this affair needs the services of a more senior officer with greater experience. He will want to garner some laurels before that happens. He is that kind of man.’ The major made the observation seem like a criticism.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I‘ve never met him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You will. Tomorrow. He has summoned me to his headquarters. He will want to learn what manner of enemy we face. You can accompany me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do you <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">know</span> what we face?’ Jack had no idea what Ballard knew.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course!’ He frowned at the question. ‘I shall deliver the information tomorrow. I have everything I need.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Can you not tell me now? It would be good to know.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard snorted. ‘You would not share your story with me. I think I shall now withhold my own.’ He grinned with childish glee.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled at the unexpected expression. Against all his better judgement, he was starting to like his new commanding officer. ‘As you will, sir. What should I do now that we are here?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You must start sniffing around. You are clearly adept at fitting in no matter what your surroundings. Make yourself known to people. Ferret around a bit. I will tell you when I have suspicions for you to act upon.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack contemplated the instructions. His new role was clearly not going to be the simple soldering he was used to. He had no responsibilities beyond Ballard’s cryptic orders. He commanded no men and he would not be expected to lead anyone into battle Yet his instincts told him that his life was in danger. He just did not know from where.</p>
