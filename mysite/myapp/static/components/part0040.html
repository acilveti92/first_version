				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Up you get, sir.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack obeyed the corporal’s order as quickly as his abused body would allow. He had been lying on the lumpy mattress in misery, battling with the pain and wondering how long he would be left there. The interruption had come as something of a relief.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘What’s going on?’ He sucked air through his teeth as his body protested at being moved. He recognised Corporal Jones from his one day spent with the company, the soldier’s Welsh accent a welcome touch of something familiar.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sorry, sir. I ain’t allowed to talk to you.’ Jones offered a smile before he ignored his orders and gave Jack some explanation. ‘The ruperts want you, sir. I don’t know any more than that. I am to let you clean yourself up and then take you to Major Dutton’s office.’ Jones clearly felt safer calling him ‘sir’, and Jack did not have the strength to tell him that the title no longer applied.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Do you know why?’ He was curious despite his pain.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No idea, sir. But then who knows what goes on in the head of a bloody officer?’ The corporal chuckled as if struck by an odd notion. ‘Except you might, I reckon.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack tried to smile. He felt the stirring of hope. He might be a villain, but if the corporal was indicative of his fellows, it appeared the redcoats bore him no ill will. Now he had been summoned, and anything was preferable to lying alone in the gloom, so he let himself be led out of the room and into the darkness that had smothered the cantonment now that the sun had long set.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Mr Lark. Sit down.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton rose to his feet as Jack was ushered into the room. It was close to one in the morning, but the major was still keen-eyed and looked workmanlike in his shirtsleeves. Jack took the chair opposite, wincing as he lowered himself carefully down, and waited to see why he had been summoned in the middle of the night.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The major chewed on his lip as he considered him. ‘Good God, what happened to you?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I fell down some stairs.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton snorted. ‘What bloody stairs?’ He shook his head. ‘Fenris?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack nodded.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘The blackguard. Well, it won’t happen again. I’ll see to that.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack didn’t care to acknowledge the promise. He eased himself into as comfortable a position as he could and waited for Dutton to speak.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton returned his attention to his paperwork, leaving Jack to sit in uncomfortable silence. Several minutes passed before the major finally shoved the papers to one side and looked at him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘It doesn’t feel right. Calling you Lark.’ Dutton’s manner was bluff. It was clear he was uncomfortable, as though he was not sure how he should deal with an impostor.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was in no mood to make the major’s life easier, so he simply sat in silence, returning the scrutinising glare with calm indifference. Dutton’s office was cramped, and Jack’s head bumped against the wall behind him. The narrow desk had plainly been in use for decades, its pockmarked surface betraying its long service to the East India Company. The contrast with the magisterial splendour of Proudfoot’s rooms was not lost on him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton frowned at Jack’s silence. ‘You look damn composed for a man facing a dance on the bloody scaffold.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I’m not on it yet.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton guffawed at the glib reply. ‘You are a brave fellow, Jack. I knew it as soon as I clapped eyes on you. But this impostor business, took me by surprise, that did. I would never have thought you were a damned charlatan.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘None of you did. Not even Proudfoot.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Indeed.’ Dutton shook his head as if clearing away an unpleasant memory. ‘It’s nice to see that damned man make a mistake. He may turn out to be human after all.’ He looked at Jack warily under a furrowed brow, suddenly cautious about revealing his true feelings towards his superior officer. Jack didn’t bat an eyelid. It was no surprise that Dutton and Proudfoot did not see eye to eye.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Why am I here, Dutton?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘To business, then.’ Dutton seemed relieved. ‘I want to know everything about the Maharajah and his army. Numbers. Weapons. Everything.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So now I am to be treated as a spy?’ Jack sensed the irony of his new role. The Maharajah’s vizier may have been right after all.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Yes, if you like. The Maharajah is going to attack. You told us that much already. Now I need details. I want to know who I am going to meet in battle.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No.’ Jack spoke the denial quietly, yet there was no mistaking the force in the word. He had hoped that the warning about the Maharajah’s impending attack would save him. Proudfoot’s reaction had made it clear he had been wrong. He saw no point in offering what little information he possessed without receiving anything in return. Dutton plainly wanted it, so Jack would wait to see what bargain could be struck.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton chewed on his moustache for a moment before he spoke. ‘I knew you would say that. I told Proudfoot the very same. He has allowed me to offer you a deal.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘A deal?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Tell us all you know and you’ll be rewarded.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack snorted. ‘Bollocks.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton grinned at Jack’s forthright phrase. ‘You’ll be allowed to fight.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I can’t see Proudfoot trusting me with a bandook. What’s to stop me shooting the bastard between the eyes the moment I get the chance?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You will be given a weapon, Jack. You’ll be allowed to fight with the 24th. You can help us beat the Maharajah.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘How the hell is that supposed to work?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You would be a redcoat. You’d fight in the ranks.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack understood immediately. ‘And likely spare you all the shame of a court-martial. It would be more convenient if I died in the battle, wouldn’t it just. No messy trial. No unpleasantness. Just an unmarked grave and bang, there you go. No impostor. No scandal.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘If I were in your shoes, I’d jump at the offer. I’d rather take my chances in battle than face being strung up like a common thief.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So you’re doing me a favour? Like I already said, bollocks.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton sat back in his chair. ‘Help us, Jack.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Help you? I’m a bloody villain. Why would you need my help?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton rubbed a hand across his face, as if trying to wipe away the exhaustion. ‘Because we need you.’ He sounded drained as he confessed the true situation. ‘Proudfoot and his lapdog Fenris have decided we are to fight the Maharajah in the open. That damn fool Kingsley agrees. They want some grand battle.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘The fucking fools.’ Jack shook his head in disbelief.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Proudfoot is already composing the dispatch he’ll be able to send the Governor. He wants a glorious victory.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘And it’s up to us to give it to them.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘They think it will be easy. Kingsley believes the Maharajah and his men will take one look at us standing in line and run for the bloody hills.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Never. He’s coming for blood. He won’t run.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I know. Which is why I need your help. We need every mother’s son who is fit to fight if we are to stand a chance. My lieutenants are already arming every bloody cook and bottle-washer in this damn place. Help me, Jack.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack heard the pleading tone. He had given up his place in the Maharajah’s court to return to his countrymen. Could he really sit by and watch them be destroyed?</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘What happens to me after the battle?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘After the battle?’ Dutton snorted. ‘Who knows what will happen to any of us. The Maharajah has over two thousand men. I’m not so bloody sure we can think about after the battle.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack nodded at the honest reply. It was clear what he had to do. He had chosen his side. He would tell Dutton everything he knew and then take his place in the battle line and fight as an ordinary soldier in an effort to snatch victory from the face of certain defeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He was a redcoat. It was all he knew.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">They marched well before dawn. The four companies formed one long column that snaked through the cantonment before turning east. The 24th Foot led the way, with Dutton’s three companies from the 12th Bengal Native Infantry forced to march in the cloud of dust kicked up by their heavy boots.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">There was no fanfare to announce their departure, only the martial call of the bugle and the rhythmic beat of the drum driving them forward. The redcoats sang as they marched, their deep voices lifting as they bellowed out the 24th’s regimental march, ‘The Warwickshire Lad’. They might not have been as good a choir as Reverend Youngsummers would have hoped for, but they sang with vigour, if not with harmony.</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-first">Ye Warwickshire lads and ye lasses,</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-middle">See what at our Jubilee passes;</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-middle">Come revel away, rejoice and be glad,</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-middle">For the lad of all lads was a Warwickshire lad,</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-middle">And the lad was a Warwickshire lad.</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-middle">Warwickshire lad! All be glad,</p>
				<p class="ver1-verse-1-last">For the lad of all lads was a Warwickshire lad.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">They had no colours to lead them; the pride of the battalion was back with the bulk of the regiment far away in the Punjab. They had only their officers to inspire them, their sergeants and corporals to rally to.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fewer than four hundred redcoats marched to do battle with the Maharajah’s army of more than two thousand.</p>
