				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">There was no time for the niceties of regular orders.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s men swirled around him, some still fighting the enemy horsemen, others looking for their mates and their officers, ready for the next set of instructions. Their ordered ranks were broken, the violent contact with the Persian cavalry shattering the neat lines in which they had charged.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Follow me!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack screamed the command. It was one more suited to the chaos of an infantry assault than to the ordered world of the cavalry, but he did not have time to gather an organised group. He did not wait to see if anyone understood. He simply rammed his spurs into his horse’s flanks, cruel in his mastery, the need for speed doing away with any notion of gentility. The willing horse responded well, and Jack raced past his disordered troopers, catching fleeting glimpses of astonished faces as their new commander powered to the rear, exhorting his men to follow.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He could see at least two dozen enemy horsemen swarming around the handful of red-coated officers. Even from a distance he could make out the flash of a sabre as the heavily outnumbered officers fought desperately to stop the enemy attack. With such odds the result was a foregone conclusion. Even as Jack raced towards them, he saw one of the red-coated figures topple from the saddle. The man hit the ground hard, the impact jarring his sword from his grasp.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fallen rider’s horse twisted on the spot, its dark pelt matted with blood from a dozen wounds. It bravely lifted its head, trying to obey the training that was buried deep in its instincts, but the valiant animal was too badly wounded and its legs buckled beneath it. It screamed as it fell, an animal shriek of mortal agony, then toppled on to its master, crushing the man to the ground.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack watched in horror as the closest Persians slashed at the fallen rider, trying to finish him off, whilst their fellows traded blows with the other red-coated officers still in the saddle. Swords thrust downwards, but the body of the dying horse frustrated them, its flesh absorbing the vicious attacks meant for its master.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack screamed as his mount closed the last of the distance. He caught a glimpse of one of the Persian cavalrymen turning in surprise as he became aware of the lone rider charging towards them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He slashed his sword from right to left, slicing the sharpened edge across the closest face. He felt the blade catch as it drove through flesh, the bright spray of blood telling him his aim had been true. He tugged on the reins, turning his horse’s head round, avoiding the body that tumbled from the saddle, his first victim falling without a sound. He saw a second rider come into range and he drove his sword forward, thrusting the tip into the man’s stomach. The blade slid into the Persian’s guts and Jack twisted it, releasing the talwar from the inevitable suction, tugging it free as he rode past.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He thought of nothing as he fought. He saw not other men but merely targets for his sword. The first attacks had slowed his horse, and now he spurred it on, making it lurch into motion once again. It bounded forward, pushing past enemy riders, its forelegs scrabbling as they fought for purchase on the friable ground. He felt a tug on his uniform and glanced down to see the tip of a lance score through the side of his jacket before it was ripped free by the sudden movement of his horse.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt the madness build. He let his horse run, rushing past the body of the fallen British officer, narrowly missing the hooves of the man’s horse, which thrashed in pitiful agony as the animal writhed in its death throes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He roared as he attacked a crowd of Persian cavalrymen surrounding one of the officers. He flashed past the mob, slashing his talwar into one man’s side and only just missing a second as he backhanded the blade.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned fast, riding back at the enemy, the anger driving out the last of his control. He could hear his own war cry, but it sounded as if it came from far away. He crashed into the melee, his bloodied sword whispering through the air as he battered it at the closest enemy. His arm jarred as his target blocked the blow with a fast parry. He bludgeoned the sword forward again, hacking at the man who had defied him, avoiding the Persian’s own desperate lunge before driving the blade into the man’s breast. His opponent fell with a scream, his hands clawing at the steel, his face twisted into an awful grimace of horror as he realised his death was upon him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The surviving Persian horsemen turned to escape. Jack’s lone attack had been fast and brutally effective. Four of their number had been slain in minutes, and the rest had no stomach for the fight now that their easy victory had been snatched away by a single blue-coated hussar. They threw their mounts round, giving the animals their heads as they tried to flee.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The slowest to turn howled in frustration as his tired horse staggered, its balance thrown by the desperate manoeuvre. Jack was on him in a flash. It took barely a heartbeat for him to catch the Persian and bury his sword in his spine. The man reared in the saddle, his body arching against the sudden agony, his hand flapping at the talwar embedded in his back. Jack pulled the blade away and the man fell, his horse galloping free.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack let the broken enemy go. He felt the madness of the desperate melee begin to slip away, rational thought once again taking control of his mind. He rammed his bloody talwar back into its leather scabbard with a grimace, his right hand cramped and sore from having held the weapon so tightly as he fought. Only then did he turn and face the officers he had saved. He recognised one man at once and called across in greeting.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Captain Hunter!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Hunter looked at him without any sign of recognition. Jack’s face was flecked with blood flung from his talwar. He looked like a grotesque spectre that had escaped from a charnel house.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fenris!’ The name emerged from the shocked captain’s mouth as he belatedly recognised the bloodied rider who had come to his aid. ‘Help me. It’s the general.’ He immediately slipped from his saddle and raced to the fallen officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack heard the panic in the aide’s voice. He jumped down and ran to help Hunter, who was doing his best to drag the general from underneath his fallen steed. Jack thrust his shoulder against the dead animal’s flank, ignoring the slick sheen of blood that covered its hide. He shoved with all his strength and managed to create enough of a gap for Hunter to haul Outram free.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Is he alive?’ he asked as Hunter leant forward and laid his cheek against the general’s nose.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Hunter nodded quickly before bending down and lifting Outram into a sitting position.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack squatted down. He looked into the general’s eyes and saw them open.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir. You are safe.’ He spoke reassuringly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Outram’s eyes failed to focus. He had been knocked insensible by the fall. His head lolled forward and Hunter was forced to cradle him like a mother holding her newborn child for the first time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’ll get help.’ Jack leapt to his feet and turned, looking for his horse. Like all well-trained cavalry mounts, it had stayed in place when he had left the saddle, and now he vaulted on to its back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As he mounted, the first of his troopers arrived at the scene. He saw the look of approval on the dark faces as they rode around him, their horses picking carefully over the bloody remains of the men he had killed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Dekho, sahib.’ The closest rider, a kot-daffadar, nodded with satisfaction at the slaughter he found scattered around his new officer. The man’s drawn sabre was smeared with blood, his white uniform belts bespattered all over. ‘You gave those bastards a jewab for killing Malet Sahib Bahadur, and no mistake.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The other troopers roared their approval. They raised their bloodied sabres, brandishing them to the sky, and cheered their new commander, celebrating his exploits.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack felt his heart constrict as he listened to their loud approval. It meant more than any medal. It was a vibrant recognition of his ability to lead men in battle, and he had never known such pride.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned to the kot-daffadar and began issuing the orders that would bring the command to order, before sending Cornet Spens on his way to summon a litter for Outram.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Daylight was beginning to creep into the sky. The long night was coming to an end. The new day was just beginning.</p>
