				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Drunk!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Not only drunk, Flowers, but drunk on duty. I also have grounds to believe he was responsible for an assault on another of my men.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I can scarcely credit it.’ The adjutant was appalled. ‘Why, he has only just joined the regiment.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook his head, as if he too could not believe what he was reporting. ‘I fear we now know why he was thrown out of his former battalion. He was a colour sergeant there, I hear, but he lost his colours for victimising the men under his command. It would also appear he has a habit of making up fanciful tales to suit his spite. It’s a bad show all round.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He’ll have to lose his stripes, of course.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course.’ Jack tried to look suitably sombre.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’ll arrange for him to transfer to another company. The timing is not ideal but it would be for the best.’ Lieutenant Flowers shook his head. ‘What possessed him? Drink really is the devil. Perhaps the temperance movement has it right.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack thought of the toothless drunks who begged or stole all day simply to be able to buy the watered-down gin his mother sold. There could not be a better example of the evil of drink but it had never made him hesitate when the ale was being poured. ‘Can you really imagine living without a drink, Flowers? No claret? No porter? No whisky to dull the pain of an evening listening to Major Peacock?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You do have a point.’ Flowers sighed. ‘Captain Devine can take him. His company is at the lowest strength. Let him make a fresh start in another company.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’d rather keep him. Give him another chance to prove himself.’ Jack wanted Slater close. There was no telling how he would react to losing his stripes and Jack was determined not to give the brutal man any opportunity to spread his poison around another officer’s company.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s very generous of you, but do you think it’s wise? The man is obviously a malcontent.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’d rather not. He’s my problem. I don’t like to hoist him on someone else.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, it’s your decision, and one that does you great credit. I’ll arrange for the colonel to deal with it this afternoon. He won’t be best pleased. He has other things on his mind.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Such as?’ Jack sensed news.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The adjutant looked around to check that no one could overhear them and dropped his voice. ‘Look, I shouldn’t be telling you this. The colonel wants to make a big announcement after church parade this afternoon and he’ll have a fit if he finds out I have stolen his thunder. Orders have come through from brigade. Raglan has agreed to march. I’ve no idea why he thinks we are ready to move but there you have it. I’m told the French have been making one hell of a fuss as we sit here dilly-dallying. So, ready or not, we’re to be off.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was the news the army had long waited to hear. The campaign was about to begin in earnest.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">There was barely a cloud to trouble the grey-blue expanse of sky that, to Jack, seemed to have taken on a vastness he had never seen. It stretched from one distant horizon to the other, one great canopy of such immensity that it left him feeling very small. The sun did nothing to lift the spirits of the men who knew they must shortly suffer a long, exhausting march under its unseasonal heat. It brought back memories of the dire period they had endured in the feverish heat at the camp in Varna prior to their departure for the Crimea.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack found Tommy Smith working with McCulloch’s orderly, Johnson, using a shot case and a roundshot to grind up more of the green coffee beans that the battalion’s officers consumed at a terrific rate.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good morning. Nice to see you both working on such an important task.’ Jack forced himself to sound jovial in front of McCulloch’s orderly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Mornin’, sir. Lovely day.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Johnson’s familiar London accent made Jack smile. ‘It is indeed, Johnson,’ he agreed, ‘but I’m afraid I need to borrow Smith.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Course, sir. No bother. He’s no bleeding use anyhow. You’re welcome to him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, Johnson. Smith, come with me please.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack led Smith away from the keen ears of his fellow orderly. The officers’ servants thrived on gossip, as he himself knew only too well.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As soon as they were far enough away, Jack confided the adjutant’s information to his orderly who took in the news calmly and immediately understood the need for caution. Any advantage to the Light Company would disappear if the news spread and they had to compete with nearly six hundred men all trying to grab a share of the meagre supplies available.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What would you like me to do first, sir?’ Smith asked, keeping his voice low and slowly scanning the surrounding area for anyone who could overhear them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, for starters you can stop looking so damn furtive.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sorry. Bit out of practice.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack chuckled. ‘I’m glad to hear that. I can’t keep checking to see if you’ve filched my pocket book every time I stand near you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Now, sir, as if I would turn your pockets. Besides, I was never a pickpocket. I had more class.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Truly? You never cease to amaze me.’ Jack shook his head. ‘I have some good news about Slater. I spoke to the adjutant and it’s done. He’ll face a battalion court martial this afternoon. I’ll be there and it’s just a formality. He’ll be reduced to the ranks.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Smith smiled at the news ‘It’s no less than he deserves after what he did to young Hayward, not to mention yourself. So what do we do about Slater now? He’ll be after you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘For now there is nothing more we can do. But watch my back.’ Jack looked at Smith keenly, seeking reassurance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Just let me get a clear shot of the bastard, sir. I’ll sort him out.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘After me, Tommy. After me.’ Jack put the happy notion to one side. ‘Now, as soon as the colonel announces that we are finally to march inland, all hell will break loose. The most important thing is water. I know it’s already hard to get enough but we need to make certain the men’s canteens are full and that we get as much extra as we can carry.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Right you are.’ Smith nodded.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Next, ammunition.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, that’s done,’ Smith said. ‘Digby-Brown carried out an ammunition check after roll call this morning. We all have our full tally. Not even Welsh Davies can have flogged any to the tinkers yet.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Very good.’ Jack was surprised. Perhaps Digby-Brown was finally starting to contribute to the effective running of the company. ‘So that leaves the rations. We’ll have to wait for whatever the rest of the battalion gets issued but looking around the place,’ Jack gestured towards the many heaps of supplies that lay dumped around the battalion lines, ‘there is no way in hell we can take everything with us. Forage around a bit and see what you can square away. And see if you can sniff me out some tea. I’m getting heartily sick of all that bloody green coffee.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m sure I can manage that. I’ll say you’re planning to take us off for another drill first thing in the morning so we need to get ready today. No one will question that. Moan like buggery and call you every name under the sun, but question it, no.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I think I’ll ignore that last remark, Fusilier.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘As you choose.’ Smith hesitated. ‘The men think you’re doing well, sir. They seem to like you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What?’ Now Jack was truly surprised. He had not forgotten the near disaster of facing the Cossacks and he did not think the men had either.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Oh, they think you’re a rum cove, all right, and they’d as soon see you piss off and leave them alone. But they’re coming round to you. Especially since they heard about you taking a pop at Peacock.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked his orderly in the eye, suspecting some flummery or banter in the words. But Smith met his gaze, his expression serious.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, I’m damn pleased to hear it. It’s about time I got some bloody recognition.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘But of course they don’t know you’re a fraud, so don’t let your head swell too much, will you, or it’s likely to get shot right off.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack grinned. ‘Not much chance of that with you to remind me, Smith.’</p>
