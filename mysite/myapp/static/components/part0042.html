				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The redcoats heard the enemy long before they could be seen. The Maharajah’s army advanced with raucous grandeur, the loud trumpeting and the crash of drums reaching the straining ears of the four hundred soldiers who waited in silence for them to arrive.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Then the horde appeared.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The redcoats stared at the enemy force as it swarmed into view, the dust kicked up by the hooves of the horses billowing down the valley to sting their eyes. There was no fanfare, the British drummers and buglers remaining silent, greeting the Maharajah’s host in the timeless manner of the redcoats: silent and stoical no matter what the provocation.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Horseman after horseman arrived, smothering the far end of the valley. Rank followed rank, the mounted warriors gathering, easing their tired horses to a stop as they spied the thin red line across their path. The sun flashed from thousands of pieces of armour and naked steel as the enemy pulled talwars from scabbards and prepared for the battle that was sure to come.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The redcoats watched wide-eyed as the enemy kept growing.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fuck me.’ Jenkins spoke in an awestruck tone. ‘There’s hundreds of ’em.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack saw the ghostly white pallor on the man’s face. ‘That’s just their cavalry. We haven’t seen their infantry yet.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well that’s just lovely, isn’t it now. I’m glad you’re with us, Mud. I wouldn’t want to have fought those buggers without knowing how many more of them are to come.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The men around Jack chuckled, seizing on the weak jest to help force down their emotions. For fear fluttered in every man’s belly as the enemy horde swelled. The minutes stretched on, the redcoats forced to stand in impotent silence as the enemy gathered its strength. The leading horsemen were the warriors from the hills, the irregular troops that had assembled at their overlord’s command. There was no sign of the blue-coated lancers or any of the beautifully uniformed guardsmen that formed the elite of the Maharajah’s forces. Yet there were still enough men to outnumber the British by over two to one.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">As the red-coated ranks stood baking in the increasing heat, the enemy cavalry studied the British line with wolfish fascination, sensing its fragility, the puny number of foot soldiers surely unable to withstand the power of the massed horsemen. They imagined an easy victory. If the thin red line were broken, then the way to the cantonment would be open. The bravest riders would have first pickings, the right to ransack the homes of the white-faced foreigners falling to those daring to be in the leading ranks of the attack.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The horsemen looked at the British line and thought of plunder.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Look, you! Look at that.’ Corporal Jones called for his mates’ attention as a lone horseman left the throng and rode steadily towards them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack, like most of the redcoats around him, had been lost in his own thoughts. It had been a long night with little sleep as he provided Major Dutton with all the details of the Maharajah’s army. His body still ached from the beating Fenris had delivered, but the long wait in the harsh sun had dulled his senses so that he stood as if in a trance, awake yet far away. Lost in a world of painful memories.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The lone rider pulled up a hundred yards clear of the massed ranks of horsemen. He stood tall in his stirrups and raised his arms. In his left hand he held his naked talwar, the blade flashing bright in the sun. In this right he held a carbine that he shook in the air as he began to shout.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The redcoats were too far away to make out the words, but the message was clear. The rider was taunting the British soldiers, insulting their manhood and rousing his fellow warriors to action. He punched his weapons into the air as he challenged the British, daring them to react.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Steady in the ranks.’ Colour Sergeant Hughes began to prowl behind the 24th’s part of the line. His voice was calm, a balm to the fears of his soldiers, who were forced to endure the enemy soldier’s display in silence. Still the tension rippled through the tight ranks, the pressure building round them as they tasted the threat of violence in the dry, arid air.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">More horsemen rode forward to join the first, pulling up alongside him and raising their own voices in a deep, visceral chant. The sound echoed down the valley, building steadily as other men came to join them, washing over the thin red line. Yet more riders made their way forward, swelling the lead rank, filling the width of the valley.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Along the line, the redcoats felt fear surge into their bellies, the icy rush of terror as they realised that the enemy was preparing to attack.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Major Dutton spurred his horse forward, then turned it around carefully, as if aligning himself on a marker.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Men!’ His voice was firm as he called for attention. ‘The enemy is near. It is time for us to defend our homes and the honour of our Queen. I expect you all to do your duty. Stand firm and shoot straight. Together we will be victorious. Together we will make our country proud.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He looked along the line, his florid face flushed crimson with exertion. Satisfied with his speech, he nudged his horse back into the line, easing it around so that he once again stood alongside Major Proudfoot.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘What a fucking idiot.’ Jenkins gave his judgement on the call to arms. ‘Together, my arse. First sign of trouble and I bet that fathead will be galloping back to the cantonment. I know I would if only those bastards would let me have a bloody horse.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack chuckled at the damning verdict. He was glad he was not Jenkins’ officer.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Then the chanting stopped, and with a final deep-throated cheer, the mass of cavalry lurched into motion.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The battle for Bhundapur had begun.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘At one hundred yards. Volley fire.’ Major Dutton shouted the command that was immediately picked up by the officers along the line.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The effects of the volley would be dreadful. Four hundred balls of lead would be spat at the charging horsemen. The leading riders and their mounts would be gutted, the massed volley capable of butchering the head of the enemy attack. Those struck down would immediately create a bloody obstacle that would disrupt anyone still trying to press home the charge. The single massive blow would spread chaos amongst the attackers with the same wanton cruelty as it would spread death.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The volley had to be timed to perfection. Fired too soon and it would lose most of its effect. The muskets were useless at much over one hundred yards. Dutton would have to let the enemy close on the line if he wanted the volley to destroy the leading ranks and ignore what would certainly be a burning desire to fire early. If he left it too late, then he would commit an even more fatal error. The volley would still smash the head of the charge to smithereens, the muskets capable of horrific damage at close range, yet the enemy’s momentum would drive them forward, man and horse turned into a projectile that would slam into the thin line and tear huge holes in its ordered ranks. The horsemen left intact would pour into the gaps, their naked talwars and sharpened spears capable of spreading havoc if they broke into the line. The redcoats would be easy targets and Dutton’s small command would be torn apart in a heartbeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">It would take only one volley for the charge to be bludgeoned to a bloody halt. But it had to be timed to perfection.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Company! Prepare to fire!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Kingsley had left the orders to his colour sergeant, deeming the act of shouting himself hoarse beneath the dignity of his rank.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The redcoats pulled their muskets to their shoulders, settling the heavy stocks so that they rested snugly. They peered down the simple sights, aiming the barrels so that they pointed at the throng that was speeding towards them. The staccato drumming of so many horses made the ground shudder under their feet. Along the line the muskets wavered, the redcoats feeling the weight pull at their arms as they waited for the command to fire.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The horsemen were covering the ground fast, the riders leaning forward in the saddle to urge their mounts to even greater efforts. This was no ordered attack, and some riders pulled ahead of their fellows so that the front of the charge bulged. With dreadful speed they tore over the dusty scrub, every heartbeat bringing them closer to the steady double line of men that stood silently in their path.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The enemy was close enough that the redcoats could see the snarls and twisted grimaces of hate on the faces of the wild horsemen thundering towards them. Every man felt the knot of terror deep in his gut, the fear twisting through his veins. The charge seemed unstoppable, its dreadful momentum sure to rip the frail line into bloody ruin.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">At one hundred and fifty yards, Jack forced his aching muscles to harden, stilling the slight movement in the barrel of his musket, tensing his sinews as he prepared to fire. The horsemen were moving with mesmerising speed now, and his finger tightened on the trigger as he anticipated the order. The horsemen gouged their vicious spurs into the flanks of their tiring mounts, their soul-searing bellows of hate intensifying as they hurtled forward, the inevitable collision with the red-coated line coming closer with every bound.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack’s mind screamed the command to fire, sensing the moment for the deadly volley to be unleashed. Yet Dutton remained silent. Jack tore his eye from his musket. In desperation he looked across to where Dutton sat in the centre of the British line, staring rapt at the enemy charge that was bearing down on his small command with such dreadful purpose. Jack was close enough to see the throb of a vein in the major’s forehead, the tension in the man obvious even from fifty yards away.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A surge of horror seared through his body. Dutton was leaving the volley too late, the inexperienced officer failing to judge the distance correctly.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">It was the worst mistake he could make.</p>
