				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Abdul El-Amir woke with a start as the door to his clerk’s office crashed open. He had been sleeping at his desk, the hookah he had been smoking lying still warm on the blotter next to his head.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had run the Hotel Splendid for more than twenty years, fleecing his guests since the day he opened, overcharging for everything he could think of. Every type of crook and beggar was at his disposal and he was not above having his guests robbed, swindled or even, on one or two memorable occasions, murdered. In all that time, no one had ever dared to try to rob <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">him</span>.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He heard the loud footsteps in the outer office, the heavy tread making directly for his own private room. He reached for his desk drawer, his thin fingers fumbling with the lock before his shaking hands opened it to reveal the stash of weapons he kept inside.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He eyed the door before making his selection. As he lifted his weapon of choice from the drawer, he felt calm descend on him. He sat back in his chair and lifted the hookah to his mouth, sucking hard to breathe life back into its smouldering heart. He was no longer frightened. He lifted a hand and settled his red fez so that it sat neatly on top of his bald head. He was intrigued to know who had dared smash their way into the heart of his establishment. He would discover who it was, and then he would kill them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The door to Abdul’s private office was closed. This time Jack did not hesitate. He kicked hard, driving his heel into the heavy wood over the lock and sending the door flying back to smash into the wall behind it. He charged into the room, very aware that the noise he was making would bring servants scurrying towards their master’s room. He would not have long.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He stopped in his tracks. He was staring into the barrel of a revolver.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Ah, Lieutenant Fenris!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked at the calm, smiling face of Abdul El-Amir. The revolver was aimed straight at his heart. It was a Dean and Adams five-shot, a twin to the one he usually carried himself. He knew how dreadfully effective the weapon could be. At such close range it would kill him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The owner of the Hotel Splendid smiled wider as he saw the look of shock on Jack’s face, and his finger curled around the trigger, the smooth action pulling it back the instant pressure was applied. In the cramped confines of the office, the explosion as the revolver fired was shocking. The gun kicked in Abdul’s hand, the recoil throwing his arm backwards.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was on his feet in a heartbeat, knocking his chair to the floor in his eagerness to check the body. He raced around his desk, keen to see how sharp his aim had been. To discover if his latest purchase had been worth the expense.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack lay on the ground, curled into a ball, his legs tucked to his chest. His ears rang from the blast of the revolver but he did his best to still his racing heart. He opened his eyes a fraction and saw the white robe rush round the desk. He could just make out the red velvet slippers underneath its heavy hem, and he watched for them to come to a halt as the man who had just tried to kill him stood over what should have been a bloody, tattered corpse.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had felt a wave of terror rush through his veins as he saw the implacable face behind the weapon. He had believed he was entering an empty office. Instead he had found a room where death waited patiently for him to arrive. In desperation he had thrown himself to the ground just before Abdul pulled the trigger, gambling that the hotel owner would not be able to follow his movement in the excitement of opening fire. His breath had been driven from his body by the hard landing on the scuffed tiled floor, the hilt of his sword driven painfully into his ribs. But he had screwed his eyes tight against the pain, holding back the rage that followed the first icy rush of fear. His fingers closed over the weapon he had bought that afternoon in the bazaar, and he pulled it free, readying it for use.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Now he roared as he launched himself to his feet. The cudgel cut through the air and slammed into Abdul’s belly. There was just enough time to see the horror and surprise on the man’s thin features before the force of the blow bent him double, his fez tumbling to the ground and rolling to bump against the wall under the room’s only window.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack chopped the cudgel downwards, bludgeoning the hotel owner to the floor. He was on him in a heartbeat, twisting the frail body around, his fingers digging into the sparse flesh without mercy as he forced the battered hotel owner on to his back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Hello, Abdul.’ Jack leered down into the face of the man who had cheated him. ‘That wasn’t a very friendly way to greet your business partner, now was it?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Abdul El-Amir’s eyes were glazed. He opened his mouth but nothing came out save a thin trickle of blood from where his lips had been crushed against his teeth by the hard landing on the floor.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had no time for pity. He slapped the man once across the face, bringing him to his senses.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Where’s my bloody ruby?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Abdul lifted his hands as if trying to shoo his attacker away, only for Jack to knock them to one side. The tall British officer straddled the hotel owner’s thin body, his weight pressing down and threatening to suffocate Abdul where he lay. He would not move until he had what he had come for.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t know—’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack slapped Abdul’s face for a second time, cutting off the words in mid flow. ‘Enough. Don’t go kicking up a fucking shine. Where is it?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Abdul closed his eyes in an attempt to escape his ruthless attacker, but Jack was in too much of a hurry to be merciful. He shook the man by the shoulders, careless of banging the back of his head hard against the floor.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He heard footsteps outside, and looked up in time to see the horrified face of a young boy of no more than ten years old peering into his master’s office. The youngster shrieked in astonishment at what he saw before taking to his heels, screaming for all he was worth.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There was no time left.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack hauled Abdul to his feet. The man weighed nothing and Jack slammed him against the wall. He reached down and plucked the forgotten revolver from the floor before pressing it against the base of the shaking hotel owner’s neck.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You cheated me,’ he snarled as he ground the barrel of the weapon into the man’s flesh. ‘You took what was mine and then you sent those dogs to kill me.’ He heard a squeal of protest but he ignored it. ‘I bet you got a nasty bloody surprise when you found the bodies. That wasn’t part of your plan, now was it?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He heard more shouts and screams echoing around the hotel. He knew he only had moments before some of the hotel’s guards arrived to save their master.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So now I am going to kill you. You understand?’ He pushed his face forward so he could growl the words directly into Abdul’s ear. ‘I’m going to blow your fucking brains out.’ Spittle was flung from his lips to land on the terrified man’s face. ‘And I hope it fucking hurts.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He pulled back, stretching his arm taut as he prepared to fire the revolver. As he did so, he heard the sound of running water. Abdul El-Amir, proud owner of the Hotel Splendid, had pissed himself.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘This is your last fucking chance, you shit-eating toad. Where’s my ruby?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s eyes kept flicking to the open door. At any second he expected to see a rush of people come running to their master’s rescue. He was prepared to change his aim, ready to send a flurry of shots into the first men he saw.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Abdul was waving his arm, pointing to the wall furthest from the door.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Where?’ Jack screamed the word. He took up the tension on the trigger, making the gun’s chamber revolve so that a fresh cartridge was beneath the hammer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Under the floor.’ The words were barely intelligible. Jack risked a glance over his shoulder. He saw the rug on the floor against the wall. It was an odd place for a fine Persian rug, and at once he understood the hotel owner’s terrified gestures.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘If you move one fucking muscle, you’re dead.’ He was already backing away as he made the threat. He kicked the red and gold rug to one side and saw the small ring handle buried in the floor. Keeping the revolver aimed at the hotel’s owner, he squatted and tugged at the handle. The hidden cache opened easily, the mechanism well oiled and silent. The hiding place held a single wooden casket secured by a padlock. It was small, no bigger than an army shako, but it was heavy. He lifted it out and tucked it under his arm, then quickly scanned the room for a way out.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There were loud shouts coming from beyond the outer office and shadows flickering across the far wall. Jack raised his arm, aiming at the open doorway. As soon as the first figure appeared, he fired. The recoil snapped his arm back, but he was ready for it, and he readjusted his aim and followed the first shot with a second, and then a third.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The crash of gunfire was horribly loud. The smell of the powder smoke caught at Jack’s throat and he coughed once before he was moving again. He dashed across the room and tore the grass tattie screen from the window, throwing it to the floor. The sudden gunfire had dampened the rescuers’ ardour, and he heard nothing as he paused at the now open window.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He saw Abdul turn his face, risking a glance at the man who had threatened to kill him. Jack stared back into eyes that were white with fear. Carefully, he bent low and scooped up the fallen fez. He smiled at its owner as he placed it on his own bare head.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Goodbye, Abdul.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned and leapt through the window.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack’s breath rasped in lungs that felt as if they were on fire. He had run without thought to direction, galloping through the maze of alleys that led away from the Hotel Splendid, thinking of nothing but escape.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Despite the pain in his lungs, he felt a sense of elation. The casket he had stolen was heavy. He did not care whether it contained his ruby, so long as it held enough money to get him out of Bombay. It was time to find a new identity; his time as Arthur Fenris was coming to an end.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He slowed his pace as he came to the wide thoroughfare that led from the Ghats on the northern edge of Bombay to the Fort at its heart. It was late at night, but there were enough carriages still making their way through the better parts of town to give him some security. He needed no more than an hour or two to gather his belongings, then he could begin his journey.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">For the first time in as long as he could remember, Jack felt a sudden longing for London. He had been in India for too long. He needed a change. He needed to return to the security of the familiar. He smiled as he pictured his mother’s expression when she saw her son return in the finery of a British officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">If Abdul’s casket contained enough money, Jack would try to find a way to book a passage on a steamer back to England.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He would go home.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The carriage pulled up sharply in a loud jangle of bits and traces. It was a stylish britzka rather than the more common lumbering shigram. The door was devoid of all decoration and Jack took a wary step backwards as it opened towards him. The inside of the carriage was dark, and for a heartbeat he was convinced that somehow Abdul had arrived to fight for his money.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Instead of naked steel or a raised gun, he saw an elegant gloved hand beckoning in his direction.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Get in, Arthur.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Sarah Draper, wife to the commander of the 64th Regiment of Foot, looked down and smiled. Her blue eyes sparkled with life, her mouth turned up in an impish smile, like a naughty schoolgirl about to break the headmistress’s rules for the first time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack didn’t hesitate. He threw his stolen fez into the gutter and climbed into the carriage, all thoughts of his mother and home disappearing in a waft of French perfume.</p>
