			<p class="bt-1st-para3">“Watson, I fear I must apologize: you are experiencing a dry spell stylistically speaking, but fully intend to return to your literary efforts in half an hour or less, and I must prevent you,” said Sherlock Holmes, idly tapping the end of his violin bow against the carpet while shooting me a despairing look. He lay draped over the entire length of our settee, the portrait of lassitude. “There’s nothing for it, my dear fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I beg your pardon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not a single alternative remains to us. We must attend this afternoon’s formal tea at Lowther Park.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I folded my newspaper in considerable shock. My fellow lodger, whether owing to some quirk of his completely inscrutable upbringing or else a natural disinclination all his own, was a man exceedingly loath to pay calls of a social nature. This aversion to idle companionship appeared to encompass the whole of humankind, save for his gentility where Mrs. Hudson was concerned and his affable manner with the best Scotland Yard had to offer. I once inquired whether the three letters he’d received by the late afternoon post were all from potential clients, and he asked who else I imagined they might be from, since his sole friend was seated twelve feet away and thus need not correspond with him via the Royal Mail. His reluctance to appear at garden parties, political dinners, fashionable soirees, and especially congratulatory fetes honoring some nigh-impossible task he himself had performed could not be overestimated. The same man who could lie in wait like an arachnid in the midst of meticulously strung filaments, tracing his prey with perfect calm despite darkness, cold, and the tension wrought by nerves honed to their finest sharpness, would flinch at the merest mention of a croquet match. And yet here he was, wrapped in his faded blue dressing gown and soberly assuring me that we were due at one of the grandest estates in Hampstead that very day.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By George. Must we?” I questioned blankly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Regrettably, yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How did you know that my writing felt uninspired this morning, or for that matter that I intended to have a fresh go at it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“When you dropped your pen in annoyance an hour ago in favor of perusing the papers, you neglected to clean the ink stain off your right forefinger. You’re a man of medical neatness but also considerable practicality. Had you washed it, I would know that you’ve abandoned the effort for the day, but since you anticipate getting ink on your hands again all too shortly, I deduce that you mean to crack on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Wonderful! Correct in every particular.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hence my apology—I have need of you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“At a garden party. You are expected, I take it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should hardly think of stirring were I not.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And—presuming that I have also been invited to this affair, which I take the liberty of doubting—why, might I ask?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Blood is thicker than water, Watson, although you’ll admit that asking me to shake the hands of dozens of aspiring Whitehall staffers is <span class="charoverride3">very</span> thick indeed.” Holmes rolled smoothly to his feet and propped the bow against his violin case. “My brother has requested that I observe one of his government subordinates. Mycroft suspects that his loyalties may be compromised.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens! Your brother fears a traitor in his employ?” Dropping the folded paper to the carpet, I leaned forward in considerable interest.</p>
			<p class="bt">He cast his eyes at the ceiling, but there was no malice in the expression. “I ought to have anticipated that you would put it much more dramatically.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’d never have agreed to attend a social function were the situation not of the utmost gravity. This fellow will be in attendance at Lowther Park?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tongues would wag were he absent, as he is hosting the event.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Damien Kenworthy?” I exclaimed. “Do you mean the young cousin of the Right Honorable James Kenworthy?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And the family’s star political son, or so I have heard.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As have I. The Kenworthy family are connected at every level, are they not? Politics, textiles, Chinese imports, weapons foundries—the list is endless. Why should your brother think anything amiss with Damien Kenworthy’s loyalties, and what is their relationship?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There exists hardly a diplomat of any name to whom Mycroft is <span class="charoverride3">not</span> in some way related, as his fingers are present in so very many governmental pies,” my friend reported glumly, “and he <span class="charoverride3">will</span> insist upon my help occasionally. Never mind that I’ve as much interest in bureaucratic intrigue as I have in the seasonal weather patterns of the planet Saturn. The facts as I know them are—you’ll come with me to Lowther Park, of course?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course. I’d sooner desert you at the height of a dangerous pursuit than leave you to fend for yourself at a high-ranking tea.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes made a rueful face which conveyed better than words his awareness I was only half in jest, tugging his watch from his waistcoat. Had his air of tragedy not been so sincere, it would have been comical, but I managed to arrest the smile which threatened.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This spring I spent five days in gin-soaked rags down Surrey Docks way, scouring Rotherhithe for word of that coiners’ ring, do you recall it? I leave it to you to guess which reconnaissance I suppose the more palatable, though I confess the Thames at that particular turning something less than artistic. Go and change and I’ll post you up in the cab.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Despite the nature of our mission, Holmes seemed reluctantly to brighten once we were clattering through London’s sluggishly teeming arteries, both of us silk-hatted with white gloves neatly brushed, for the sky was dotted with fat clouds against the blue, and the summer air unusually clear and temperate. He lost no time in telling me of his sibling’s dilemma.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mycroft was recently ordered to select a discreet gentleman to oversee a committee which will evaluate the efficacy of our national telegraphic system.” Crossing his legs, Holmes linked slender fingers around his knee. “I need hardly tell you that such a study would encompass an array of practical uses, private ones no less than military, for the speed with which we can communicate is integral to modern interests of all kinds. Following his success as a high-level Cabinet secretary, Damien Kenworthy seemed an ideal fit. His colleagues praised him, reporting that in all matters he was shrewd, articulate, and diplomatic. My brother suggested his appointment, knowing Kenworthy’s organizational mind deeply incisive. As Mycroft does not dispense advice without careful cogitation . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And as your brother’s capacity for cogitation is unrivaled in the Western hemisphere, the appointment came to pass.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Precisely.” Holmes pulled a pair of cigarettes from his case and flicked a lucifer against the cab door, squinting out at the slate-colored traffic and the remnants of glinting straw ground into the cobblestones. Leaning forward to light mine, he pursed his lips in thought. “By all accounts, Mr. Kenworthy already excels at his new office, speeding every effort to assess England’s internal system of communication.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What went amiss?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yesterday morning he placed a document on Mycroft’s desk. It was an efficiency report similar in structure to the one Kenworthy has been tasked with producing nationwide—one ordered by the president of a large private electrical telegraph firm based in Barcelona, a rich businessman by the name of Francisco Murillo. Mr. Kenworthy suggested using the study of the Compañía Telegráfica de Murillo as a guideline. There was only one problem.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Which was?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The Compañía Telegráfica de Murillo,” Holmes trilled, “does not exist.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Seeing my bemused expression, my friend chuckled silently.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mycroft’s particular value to the throne of England is to know everything, and thus he was slightly perplexed when a study of an imaginary telegraph company was given him by a trusted official. I confess that neither of us can think what to make of it yet, nor would it behoove us to spin theories in such a vacuum of facts. But Damien Kenworthy is privy to a great many sensitive documents because of this study, including reports detailing countless military communication protocols, and thus my brother supposed caution the watchword of the hour. Not,” he added dourly, “that he went so far as to investigate it himself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The fact that Mycroft Holmes was not personally reconnoitering, as the intellectual superior of the two unconventional siblings, did not at this point in our friendship surprise me. The elder (and far larger) Holmes brother was as likely to leave his orbit of the Diogenes Club, his government office, and his Pall Mall lodgings as he was to suddenly take flight.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thereby necessitating your emergence in polite society. My sincerest condolences.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I detect traces of amusement in your tone, but I shall ignore them, as they are beneath you,” Holmes said with the merest uptick of a smile. “I fear that even if Brother Mycroft wished to join us, which of course he does not, he cannot abandon his desk considering the present situation in St. Petersburg. You and I, Watson, constitute a stalwart vanguard of two.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Half an hour later as we pulled into the circular drive at Lowther Park, its grounds exquisitely manicured and its trees dark-leafed and velvety in the brilliant July sunlight, I noted the abundance of shining brass-fitted carriages depositing their artfully dressed passengers before the estate’s pale stone entrance. Our cab looked quite humble by comparison.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dear me, I see that Lord Rallison has not tempered his affection for the gaming tables,” Holmes murmured with a wink. “His thoroughbreds have always been matched before, and to see a liver chestnut mare with a white forelock harnessed beside a sorrel? Shocking, my dear fellow, and at such a public event, no less! Avert your eyes from this disgraceful sight, and let us discover what perils lurk indoors.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Inside, the manor was as quietly sumptuous as a museum, hung with pale gold draperies, each successive alcove housing a more idyllic Flemish oil landscape or a more delicately wrought portrait of a blushing heiress with pearls in her hair. While the opulence was dazzling to my eye, my friend coolly ignored it, just as he always disdained to note the obvious trappings of wealth. Meanwhile Holmes, assuming as if he were donning a coat that effortless courtesy which belied his wholesale aversion to the beau monde, passed his card to a manservant. A few moments later, we were in the presence of our host.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The younger Mr. Holmes!” Damien Kenworthy exclaimed, extending his hand. “And Dr. Watson, I can only imagine, from the accounts I have seen in <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The same. Thank you for having us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are both very welcome, I’m sure. Mr. Mycroft Holmes is a brilliant man, and one to whom I am much indebted for my present appointment.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The pictures I had seen in various newspapers had done a poor job of capturing the buoyant, boyish air of enthusiasm which seemed to infuse Damien Kenworthy’s every cell. There are men possessing excessive energy who mask it under pretended indifference—indeed, I resided with one—but Mr. Kenworthy’s eagerness appeared almost puppyish. He was a short, active man, with pale features and a flaxen moustache, but the pallor of his coloring was instantly offset by a pair of dark, glittering eyes. His gaze was perceptive, almost calculating. Holmes, his own remarkable keenness of vision veiled by the languor in his attitude, doubtless took in our host’s rich swallowtails and active, blue-veined hands still more thoroughly than I did as he greeted the gentleman.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My brother is rather a rare specimen, I admit,” said he.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Exceptionality appears to be a family trait,” Kenworthy noted genially as he led us through the spacious house to the back veranda, where sober young gentlemen and chiffon-flounced young ladies with ivory-handled parasols in their slack fingers milled about. “Ah, just the thing! Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, may I present Mr. Francisco Murillo, the former president of the Compañía Telegráfica de Murillo of Catalonia, and a great help to me with our current project.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I exchanged introductions in considerable surprise. Before us stood a giant of a man, bearlike and swarthy with a broad, intellectual brow and a carefully trimmed black beard framing his full, almost obstinate mouth. He was dressed in a more ostentatious manner than an Englishman would have been, with gold piping lining his jacket and delicate shell buttons dotting his embroidered waistcoat. The sun gleamed from his slicked-back hair and shining boots. Murillo angled his heel and made a dignified bow to the pair of us, his attention fastening at once to my friend. Apparently, whether the Compañía Telegráfica de Murillo existed or no, it was possessed of a very live and formidable ex-president.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Gentlemen, is it an honor to make your acquaintance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely the honor is ours,” Holmes demurred. “The study will benefit considerably from your experience, or so I hear.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tut, I merely provided a template,” he said in deep, rasping Spanish-accented tones. “I am in London on other business and when I met Mr. Kenworthy last week, at a function for foreign dignitaries, naturally I wired my former company in hopes that our work might be of some use.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very good of you, too. May I ask the nature of your new venture, Mr. Murillo, the one which brings you to our shores?” Holmes inquired with a barely visible spark in his cool grey eye.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No firm venture as of yet, Mr. Holmes, though I hope to found a shipping line within the year. I own extensive holdings in England—property, securities—but I require capital. I completed the liquidation of my assets this morning and will return to Barcelona tonight. In fact, I must now begin to make my goodbyes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Can this be Mr. Sherlock Holmes?” crooned a lilting soprano from just behind my left elbow. “Miss Jacquelynn Bost, and <span class="charoverride3">very</span> charmed to encounter you at last.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The voice belonged to a lovely maiden with a striking array of chestnut hair floating above her milky shoulders, who dangled her white hand out before my friend’s cravat. He took it with, though only I could have noted the fact, something rather less than complete enthusiasm. As for myself, I was instantly captivated—Miss Bost’s nose may have been snub, and her porcelain chin pointed, but when all was taken together with the merry curve of her lips and the eyes flitting from sight to sight like bluebirds, one could not help but think her a delightful addition to any gathering. She wore a vivid sapphire silk gown with a copper sash to set off her auburn tresses, and a bonnet emitting a spray of cobalt plumes, completing the image of a blithe and bonny spirit.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes, the moment you entered, I knew you could be no one else,” she continued, lashes batting like butterfly wings. “That jaw, that stature—Mr. Paget’s illustrations in ‘The Red-Headed League’ were as good as any photograph. I hope everything at Baker Street is quite topsy-turvy of late, and you’ve not had any recent tranquillity to plague your spirits. Oh, dear—forgive my presumptuousness, but I am an <span class="charoverride3">avid </span>reader of <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand,</span> sir, and thus feel I know you quite intimately already.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You have the doctor here to thank for that, Miss Bost,” Holmes drawled. “As, in fact, do I.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I feel so privileged to meet you, Dr. Watson. Do please say you’re writing more adventures, that you’re writing them in your head this very <span class="charoverride3">minute</span> even as you speak<span class="charoverride3">.</span> Swear to me that you are.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I was writing this morning,” I answered with a significant look at the detective. “But I was lured away.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, I’d consider it a personal favor if you marched straight back to work, and speedily,” she teased. “Your stories are that breathtaking, on my life they are. I always buy the new <span class="charoverride3">Strand</span> twice when you’re in it—one for reading and rereading, and a copy to keep on my shelf. Some of my friends think it mad, but other ladies understand me perfectly. One day I hope to have a great collection of them, but that’s up to the pair of you, isn’t it now? I’m always <span class="charoverride3">ever</span> so grateful to hear more news of Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The pleasure is entirely mine, Miss Bost,” I replied, laughing.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Speaking for my part,” my friend breathed in a rapid murmur audible only to me, “that much is indisputable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes, I have dreamt for <span class="charoverride3">months</span> of encountering you personally this way. I would so like to know everything about the science of detection, though I believe it in your case an art, rather. Your life must be so <span class="charoverride3">thrilling,</span> so—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I regret, Miss Bost, that Holmes and I must finish a previous conversation,” I interrupted when my friend pinched my arm severely. He steered me back toward the house, to which our host and the mysterious Mr. Murillo had repaired. “Another time, perhaps!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“For God’s sake, we’ve been entrusted with a mission on behalf of the Crown,” Holmes hissed at me. “A garden party is no place for small talk.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not where we are concerned. And I hope you are well satisfied that I cannot appear in public without being chattered at like some grotesque hero from the lowest form of penny dreadful.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes, <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand </span>is a literary magazine, and you haven’t the slightest desire to appear in public anyhow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That has nothing to do with—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My briefcase!” The balmy air of the veranda was rent by a terrible cry. “God in heaven, what has happened? Thieves! <span class="charoverride3">Thieves!</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">Dozens of pristinely coiffed heads swiveled in shock. The commotion centered on Mr. Francisco Murillo, who stood in the doorway leading to the stone veranda, clutching an open briefcase with two hands. Swaying in the extremity of his distress, he waved the empty receptacle as a wild flush spread across his ursine features.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I left this case in Mr. Kenworthy’s private study,” he snarled. “It contained securities, deeds, over two thousand pounds in valuables. Who in the name of the devil can have done this, and to an innocent stranger? I have been made the victim of an unconscionable crime!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But—but that’s impossible,” Kenworthy stammered, pale face growing still paler. He had appeared within seconds of the dreadful shout. “I locked the door to the study myself. I’ve the only key!”</p>
			<p class="bt">While the assembly glanced about them, scandalized heads bobbing aimlessly like the beaks of so many sparrows, Sherlock Holmes stilled in concentration. It is ever the case that crises hone him, render his already caustic presence as sharp as a knife’s edge, and in such circumstances, he positively gleams with the confidence of being entirely in his element. Though I have witnessed it some scores of times, I have not tired of it; as for our new acquaintance, Miss Bost was lit up like a Chinese firework.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Might I strongly suggest, Mr. Kenworthy, that the entire party be prevailed upon to stay on the premises until we can make a bit more sense of this situation?” the sleuth suggested.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By all means, yes—yes, of course. Ladies and gentlemen!” Mr. Kenworthy called out. “With my most abject apologies, I charge you all to remain until we have made a preliminary investigation. Pray God this is all some ghastly joke, and we find Mr. Murillo’s property directly!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A robbery <span class="charoverride3">and</span> a detainment! Oh, I can’t believe my luck, I simply <span class="charoverride3">can’t.</span> And to think that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is here, at the very scene of the crime!” Miss Bost exulted as the guests were ushered back into the house.</p>
			<p class="bt">I half-expected another dour remark from Holmes, but criminal chaos had enormously improved his humor; instead he made the tiniest of bows to the lady as she passed us by, aglow with feminine enthusiasm.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, I don’t know what to think—nor what to say, of course, Mr. Murillo.” Kenworthy mopped a kerchief over his brow. We hurried inside once the servants had courteously cleared the veranda of guests and led them to the dining hall, where more refreshments were being laid out. “The study is this way, Mr. Holmes. I had placed the briefcase at his request on my own desk, knowing the room quite secure. Dear God, if someone here has—”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend had already pounced with catlike swiftness before the study door, tracing the outline of the lock with his fingertips. He went fully to his knees with a frown. Pulling his lens from the inner pocket of his morning coat, Holmes leant farther in to study the gleaming metal, which—even without magnification—was visibly gouged with shallow but deliberate scratches. The mechanism had recently done battle with a foe, so much was clear. After he had completed his examination the detective glanced up at me, grinning inexplicably.</p>
			<p class="bt">“See anything of interest regarding this lock, Watson?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, of course. It appears to have been rudely tampered with.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah. I was much more intrigued by the design,” he said with a shrug. “American innovation originated at mid-century by Alfred Charles Hobbs, a classic patented Protector lock. No matter, however. Shall we go in?”</p>
			<p class="bt">I followed, wondering how the lock’s make could possibly bear upon the case. Once we were inside the study, our host and his outraged acquaintance Murillo close upon our heels, Holmes lost no time in commencing his exploration. A fine bulky desk of polished oak presided over the small, windowless chamber, and two plush armchairs sat in the front corners. It seemed an efficient, masculine workplace, well lived in, with a collection of decanters on a mirrored cart at the corner of the room and a ready box of cigars upon the side table. I could see nothing disarranged, but that was hardly surprising—if the thief had wanted to plunder Murillo’s briefcase specifically, he or she need not have touched aught else.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You left the briefcase here?” Holmes inquired without looking at Kenworthy, dragging his fingers over the desktop.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes. I then returned to the festivities after securing the door. The lock has been tampered with, you said?” the diplomat finished nervously.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I did not. However, that is the studied opinion of Dr. Watson here, and I have never known him to be far astray.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Both Kenworthy and Murillo released muffled sounds of distress at this assertion, whilst I quirked my eyebrows at Holmes as he finished a quick perusal of the fireplace. I could not help noticing that he was by no means giving the scene of the theft his most thorough attention. His gaze slid to and fro, lighting on nothing particular in a way which seemed extremely unlike the man, and twice he made an entire slow circle without seeming to view his surroundings at all. Holmes the investigator operates on two levels: that of gathering data, and that of ruminating over it. It was bizarre to me to see him introspective in the midst of the former stage rather than the latter. He glanced at the carpet cursorily, wandered from window to door and back again with his thumbs brushing idly round each other, fiddled with Murillo’s emptied briefcase where the Spaniard had replaced it on the desk, and soon made me so uneasy that it was all I could do not to demand he reveal what the deuce the matter was.</p>
			<p class="bt">Kenworthy and Murillo likewise watched him in increasing disquiet; everyone present save for my friend attended to each tick of the standing clock in the corner, picturing the burglar striding away from the property with his pockets full of bank notes and a whistle on his lips.</p>
			<p class="bt">At length, Holmes spun away from the plundered leather case to face us, clasping his hands, mingled embarrassment and sorrow writ clear upon his visage. “Well, really! It’s no use prevaricating—unfortunately, I admit to you that I’m at a complete loss. The like has hardly ever happened to me before now, but Mr. Murillo, I believe this theft to have been the work of a master criminal who has left not a single tangible clue save for some clumsy scratches when he meddled with the door. I’ve failed to glean anything from the room, and was no more successful with your briefcase.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes,” I could only marvel, “however is that possible?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I hardly know myself, confound it—I only know that I have been thoroughly bested. Now no doubt you’ll think your trust in me misplaced.” Never have I seen his face so shadowed in gloom. “I cannot blame you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“On the contrary!” I exclaimed, aghast.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come, come, your disappointment is only logical! I’m sorry, every­one, but even I can see nothing when there is nothing to <span class="charoverride3">see</span>. The obvious forced entrance is our sole indication. We are dealing with a very cool hand indeed. Only the most expert of cracksmen could pick that lock—I myself could not do it in under ten minutes’ time. Perhaps I could not manage it at all, and I am no raw amateur.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely there are steps to be taken!” Murillo remonstrated.</p>
			<p class="bt">Taking his lower lip between his teeth, Holmes shrugged. “My only remaining avenue of inquiry is to question our fellow guests with the most exacting precision, and pray that one of them gives something away. What hope lies in that corner, however, I cannot tell you, as the thief may well have made an escape by now. Undoubtedly, this marks a low point in what has previously been a largely successful career.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Murillo collapsed into the nearest armchair, devastated at his misfortune. Kenworthy, looking no less bleak, gripped his associate’s arm and offered him port from the sideboard. My first thought was to provide some words of encouragement for my poor friend, who was as shaken as I had ever seen him. When he swept out of the room with a defeated growl in his throat, I made terse excuses and pursued, hoping that in the thick of his black humor he would consent to speak to me at all.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes? Holmes! I hope you know that I would never—”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend abruptly stopped at the end of the passageway and turned to face me, suddenly looking as delighted as I have ever seen him appear at a society function. His narrow ribs shook with suppressed mirth, his thin face was flushed, and his eyes were bright as coins. We had been duped, I realized. My relief was so profound that it did not at first occur to me to be irritable over the deception.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What do you make of it?” Holmes whispered. “Isn’t it gorgeous?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I make nothing whatsoever of the real leader of an imaginary telegraph company, whose briefcase has been emptied from within a study with an unpickable lock,” I retorted, though his joy was infectious.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, never mind. I make something of it, so you needn’t concern yourself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are acting entirely out of character.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How so?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That was the least comprehensive study of a crime scene I have ever witnessed you enact.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, you wound me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No I don’t. And that show of defeat—what were you playing at?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But it wasn’t a show at all! No, no, no. Solving that crime is quite impossible, Doctor, as I already mentioned perfectly seriously. There were no threads to grasp. I shall take what solace I can in solving another one entirely.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The sleuth strode off again, this time in the direction of the dining hall, where the guests must have been anxiously awaiting us. I began to ask whether he meant to question them, but Holmes waved for my silence. He stopped before a carved sliding door, listening to the murmur of voices just beyond by pressing his ear firmly to the wood. Satisfied, Holmes put his hands in his pockets and leant back against the wall.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You have no intention of questioning the suspects,” I surmised, all at sea.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s head dipped subtly. “That would be an egregious waste of my time.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Because they know approximately as much about this as you do, my dear fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The sliding door cracked open, revealing the russet head and excitable features belonging to Miss Jacquelynn Bost.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There you both are!” She drank in the sight of Holmes leaning next to the panel, I standing beside him with my arms folded, wearing an exasperated expression. “My own conscience is clear, so I confess myself <span class="charoverride3">terribly</span> well<span class="charoverride3"> </span>pleased at the turn of events. Isn’t it all <span class="charoverride3">marvelous</span>?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Absolutely,” Holmes agreed with genuine enthusiasm. “I really couldn’t ask for better, Miss Bost.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Glowing, Miss Bost withdrew and the door slid silently shut once more.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, what the devil is going on?”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend crossed his lips with his index and middle fingers. “Quieter. Several things are going on, Watson. First and foremost, my attendance was not expected by our adversaries. You haven’t your gun, have you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No,” I answered, startled.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Pity, that.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“For heaven’s sake, Holmes—”</p>
			<p class="bt">I came to an abrupt halt when his hand caught my elbow. Measured footsteps approached from the direction of the hallway. Steeling myself for whatever danger might befall us, I backed up to the wall as Holmes had done and waited, my breathing quiet and my posture braced against attack.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Francisco Murillo emerged from the corridor looking extraordinarily well recovered. At the sight of us, he stopped short, but then continued on his path with confidence. Mr. Damien Kenworthy appeared seconds later, running a barely trembling hand through his flaxen hair.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Have you finished questioning the others so soon?” Murillo demanded.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Finished? I’ve not yet begun.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The Spaniard’s teeth clenched above his sable beard. “No?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, no, it sounded so dreadfully tedious. I’ll start as soon as we’ve bidden you bon voyage<span class="charoverride3"> </span>properly. To tell the truth, I’ve been thinking over the data, and have only just come to terms with their meaning. As it would take me a matter of some two hours to interrogate everyone in the house, I thought it better to say farewell first, and to apologize again for my lack of progress,” Holmes demurred unflappably. He yawned. “We can’t have you spreading rumor of my incompetence across the Continent, not when making amends could ensure a better report of my talents. Reputation is everything to a consultant, you understand. You’ll say nothing, I hope?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Kenworthy’s neck began to redden as he peered from Holmes to Murillo and back again. “I say, Mr. Holmes, we sympathize that so far your investigation has proved a failure, but you needn’t sound so glib. It’s Mr. Murillo who has suffered by it, after all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“This is outrageous—a shocking scandal—but I cannot possibly waste any more time,” Murillo dismissed them in a harsh grate. “As Kenworthy says, I have lost my capital, and if I do not depart, I will lose my ship as well.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a pity.” Holmes smiled as if there were ice resting on his tongue.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your appalling lack of manners has been noted, Mr. Holmes,” ­Murillo snapped, and I instinctually edged closer to my friend. “Never­theless I wish you luck, since you seem to be in dire need of it. Mr. Kenworthy here will surely inform me if the sum is recovered.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And it will be!” Kenworthy cried. “On my honor, sir—Mr. Holmes here is the best criminal investigator in London. A single setback does not guarantee permanent defeat. He will do right by us eventually, and then I shall see that the money is placed back in your hands with all speed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is enough to severely test a man, but it cannot be helped,” Murillo growled. “Very well. I must take my leave of this godforsaken place.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not before I cast an eye over that briefcase,” my friend objected.</p>
			<p class="bt">Murillo froze in mid-step. “It is empty. What use could it possibly be now—to me, to anyone?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That is precisely what I want to find out.” Holmes’s voice had turned as inflexible as his posture, which now radiated antagonism.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come now, Mr. Holmes.” Kenworthy’s ashen skin was beaded with moisture. “I have been humiliated enough tonight, have I not, what with a robbery taking place in my own locked study? I admire your exactitude, but I cannot suffer a wronged man to be detained against his will. Mr. Murillo will lose his ship if he dallies.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then Mr. Murillo,” Sherlock Holmes declared, “will lose his ship.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The next few minutes unfolded in a dramatic fashion which will never leave my mind no matter how elderly and doddering I may become. As if fire had touched his heels, Murillo was running, sprinting with speed that belied his great bulk down the central passageway, Holmes racing after him with a shout. My own legs sprang into action an instant later, sending me veering past artworks and vases and potted ferns, and led me hurtling into the sunlight beyond the front door.</p>
			<p class="bt">I reached the carriage-choked drive seconds after Holmes and Murillo, little aware that I was about to witness a terrible sight. My swifter friend had caught the pursued with one long arm about his neck, but the Spaniard did not yet consider himself to be bested. Crashing backward with all his weight, determined to knock the wind from his captor, he sent Holmes’s elbow through a coach window that shattered into scores of glinting dagger points before my eyes.</p>
			<p class="bt">Though I shouted, I cannot recall what exclamation of dismay escaped my lips. Holmes kept his grip with a pained grimace, but I could see as I rushed toward them the stain of blood upon glass, a scarlet trickle dripping down a shard like a dragon’s tooth, and I knew that one splinter at least had done potentially serious damage.</p>
			<p class="bt">Outrage battled with fear for supremacy in my heart—but these dark feelings only served to speed my actions, and Francisco Murillo proved no match for the pair of us. A harsh uppercut from me sent him staggering, and Holmes, with acrobatic dexterity, caught his own wrist with his opposite hand, pressing with all the force of his wiry forearm against the brute’s larynx. Within ten more seconds, Murillo was on the ground, robbed of both his consciousness and his briefcase, as my bleeding friend eagerly flicked open the clasps and revealed the contents. The leather valise was brimful with papers.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear fellow, wait—” I attempted, less worried at the moment about documents than about my friend’s health.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Internal military communications reports,” Holmes gasped, still struggling for breath after his collision with the carriage. He coughed violently, but did not cease his rummaging.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Stop, I tell you! Let me—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Highly sensitive government files, telegram protocols . . . Oh, just imagine the look on my brother’s face when I hand this over!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, yes, you’re very clever. And in a moment, if you don’t let me examine you, I’m going to procure physical restraints.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, they would have got away with it, too, if not—look to Kenworthy!”</p>
			<p class="bt">Following Holmes’s upraised eye, I swung about to face the manor’s front doorway. But Damien Kenworthy only collapsed to the stone steps, his head buried in his arms, the picture of a fallen man with no hope of recourse.</p>
			<p class="bt">With the aid of several stalwart Whitehall aspirers and two retired generals, we managed to secure Kenworthy and Murillo within, sending word both to the Yard and to Mycroft Holmes that the proper authorities were required in Hampstead immediately. I, meanwhile, convinced Holmes that bleeding all over the house would hardly be appropriate, as there were ladies present, and whisked him off to the kitchen to patch him back together, dismissing the frightened staff after they had provided me with a medical kit.</p>
			<p class="bt">Once I had him sat upon the table, after having twice lost my temper far enough to bark at the impossible creature, the manic man of action quieted into a more docile version of Sherlock Holmes, and he allowed his coat to be peeled off and his shirtsleeves sliced farther open. The gash ran from his elbow up the back of his arm for six inches, but was gratifyingly shallow save for one deep gouge, and could be stanched with cloth and plasters until I was able to stitch it up at Baker Street. I breathed a sigh of relief and set to work with the iodine.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your argument regarding the delicacy of the fair sex is not entirely sound,” Holmes noted with a twinkle in his eye, folding his ruined jacket and pushing it aside as I cut a length of bandaging. “Miss Bost is a lady, and doubtless would much prefer to witness firsthand blood which was shed in the cause of justice. I say, you look slightly dazed, Doctor,” he added, concerned.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You could have been severely injured,” I muttered. “In fact, for all you know, you <span class="charoverride3">are </span>severely injured, but you are the most stubborn patient I’ve ever been unlucky enough to treat. Now, be still<span class="charoverride3"> </span>while I prevent this from becoming infected.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, I did not mean to alarm you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps not, but setting intentions aside, you did alarm me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Don’t look like that, my dear fellow—it’s only a scratch.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sighing, I shook my head. “I know that. Still, it was all a bit excessive, Holmes. I have been used to aiding you in perilous situations, and very occasionally aiding you at tea parties, but never simultaneously.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very true.” Holmes observed me with mock gravity. “It was a double-fronted war, to be sure, and one you fought most valiantly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You flatter me. By way of reward, rather than keeping me in the dark until your public denouement, you shall at once tell me what in the name of the devil just happened.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend, happily, was so delighted to have wrestled a villain to the grass at a garden soiree as to be amenable to this request.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was the Protector lock.” His eyes tensed at their edges as I cleaned the cut, but otherwise he failed to react at all. “We both knew Murillo’s former company to be fanciful, but the lock was the second lie. That variety of lock can be picked only with the greatest skill, and using a very fine tool. A half-diamond pick or even a snake rake, as it’s called, would fail utterly, and my own preference is to employ a leather needle when cracking such a subtle device. Nothing and no one capable of causing those clumsy gouges in the metal could pick that lock. Therefore?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Kenworthy desired us to suppose the lock had been picked when it had not.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Exactly so.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But what was their scheme, Holmes? Where did the Compañía Telegráfica de Murillo enter into it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Doubtless Damien Kenworthy will fill us in on the exact details, but here is what I surmise. Kenworthy, as befalls so many of our young aristocrats for one reason and another, found himself in need of money. Selling household treasures and family heirlooms is the surest way to expose that sordid secret, and so he determined to steal himself a valuable commodity instead—the most sensitive of the military papers to which he had access. He engaged Murillo as an accomplice.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Now, the creation of a plausible scapegoat is a very touch-and-go business. But Kenworthy’s plan was subtler than most. He set Murillo up as the ex-president of a telegraph firm and gave Mycroft a study claiming the same. The mistake, he thought, would not be noticed at once. Instead, Murillo would attend Kenworthy’s event as a benign acquaintance, bearing an empty briefcase, and lock it within Kenworthy’s study. Kenworthy would then deface his own lock, suggesting an intruder had penetrated the house, or even casting suspicions on one of his guests. Following the robbery outcry, but <span class="charoverride3">after</span> the study had been examined, he would leave Murillo—overwhelmed and distraught—with free access to the supposed crime scene. The safe containing the true valuables, the military documents, would be left open, or else in a quiet moment Kenworthy would open it himself and turn the papers over. After a failed investigation into his lost capital, Murillo would then exit Lowther Park with state secrets hidden in a supposedly empty briefcase. Do you follow me so far?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very clearly. But why—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The trick to stealing from Parliament is in laying the blame at another’s doorstep. Tomorrow, or the next day perhaps, once Murillo’s whereabouts were well and truly untraceable, Kenworthy would have appeared with his hat in his hand and a look of horrified contrition before my brother. He would confess the papers were missing, call the mysterious unsolved robbery at his home a clever hoax, accuse Murillo of the theft, and then point out—proving once and for all that Francisco Murillo could not be trusted—that the Compañía Telegráfica de Murillo <span class="charoverride3">does not even exist.</span> Kenworthy would have been demoted, I imagine, but not arrested. Mycroft, however, knew the truth about the company at once, of course. And so here we are.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If you are right,” I said, tying the knot on the bandage, “it was a low and despicable scheme.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That may be true,” Holmes reflected, “but it made for a highly meritorious garden party. The best I have ever attended.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes was not the only guest who thought so. It proved that Miss Jacquelynn Bost, whose slightly rabid regard for my friend’s work could not fail to endear her to me, was the society columnist for a well-known London women’s magazine, and very apt to recount personal anecdotes for the delight of matrons and housewives. She lost no time whatsoever in declaring the Kenworthy tea “the nonpareil event of the fashionable season” thanks to the “stunning drama of having firsthand witnessed Mr. Sherlock Holmes prevent a crime of national moment.” It was Mrs. Hudson who brought this document to my attention, and when I showed it to Holmes, his remark was one in which I took a certain degree of modest pleasure.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You have made your point, Watson,” he acknowledged with an ironic twist to his brow, putting his cherrywood pipe between his lips decisively. “<span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand</span> is, if only by comparison, a <span class="charoverride3">highly</span> literary magazine.”</p>
