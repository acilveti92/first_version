				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Perhaps the most astonishing fact about the campaign against the Shah of Persia is that even the British authorities seemed to forget about it so very quickly. Just fourteen years after the battle was fought, the Shah of Persia, Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar, was invited to visit Great Britain as a guest of Queen Victoria. During his visit he was appointed to the Order of the Garter, Britain’s highest order of chivalry. Such was the fleeting nature of enemies in the days when the British Empire was at its height.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Outram’s campaign was certainly a success. After the battle at Khoosh-Ab, he mounted an expedition further north, advancing up the Shatt al-Arab waterway before launching an attack on another Persian defensive position at Mohammerah. Despite the strength of the enemy position, Havelock’s division captured it on 27 March with barely a casualty following a dreadfully effective naval bombardment. There was another skirmish on 1 April when the 64th Foot and the 78th Highlanders attacked a Persian force at Ahvaz, and then it was all over. The Shah asked for terms and within a year the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending further hostilities. The treaty safeguarded the future of Herat and required the Shah to withdraw his troops. The British had fulfilled their objectives.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Battle of Khoosh-Ab is largely ignored in the great histories of the time. Given that within months of the victory the Empire was thrown into complete disarray by the dreadful bloodletting that was the Indian Mutiny, this is hardly surprising. Yet at the time, it was John Bull’s favourite type of military campaign. Not only did it provide a victorious demonstration of the power of Britain’s army, but it was accomplished on a field of battle far from home and with a minimal cost in British lives.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The battle itself was largely as described in the novel. The British cavalry and the artillery did win the day without much help from the stoic British infantry. The efforts of the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry were particularly striking. Their destruction of a battalion of trained infantrymen is one of the rare occasions when unsupported cavalry managed to best a fully formed square, and as such it is still lauded as one of the greatest feats of arms of its day.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">However, as ever, the needs of the writer necessitated a few tweaks, for which I humbly apologise. Captain John Augustus Wood did lead the assault on the Dutch fort at Reshire, but he served in the ranks of the 20th Bombay Native Infantry and not in those of the 64th<span> </span>Foot. Captain Wood was awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts, a decoration that was only just in its infancy but which conveyed, then as now, the extreme valour of the men to whom it was awarded.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">More Victoria Crosses were won at Khoosh-Ab. The younger Moore did indeed leap into the Persian square, killing his horse and breaking his sword in the process. His brother, Ross, cut his way to his sibling’s aid, but it was Lieutenant John Grant Malcolmson who fought at his side and offered Moore a stirrup. Jack Lark stole Malcolmson’s place, and for that I must again beg for forgiveness.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Major General Foster Stalker did commit suicide after the battle. There is something very wretched in the way this tragic event is mentioned in only a single, terse line in every history I have read of the campaign. It truly was a sad end for a man who had served his country so well in his long career.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Equally tragic was the suicide of Commander Richard Ethersey of the Indian navy just a few days later. Ethersey was very much the inspiration for Fetherstone, but there is absolutely no connection between the two. There was simply too much in the coincidence of the twin suicides for me to ignore, and I must quite rightly stand accused of stealing the history for my own ends.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The problem of spies dogging the expeditionary force was a genuine one. Major Ballard is based on the real head of the intelligence department, and the tale of his bold inspection of the Persian defences at Reshire is quite true. One of his roles was most certainly to root out the Persian spies who followed the army throughout the campaign. He was not without success, and the whole notion of the hunt for a spy was given life when I read of a Persian munshi who disappeared one night shortly before Khoosh-Ab. There is no evidence, however, that the Persian spies provided any great intelligence, and I fear I have made more of the situation than really occurred. The Persian commander retreated from Outram’s rapid advance to Borãzjoon, but certainly there is nothing to indicate that this was the result of intelligence passed by any spy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As might be expected for a battle and a campaign that have largely been forgotten, there are very few books that give more than a passing reference to it. I can, however, heartily recommend<span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic"> Britain’s Forgotten Wars</span>, by Ian Hernon. As ever, the Persian War is only given scant coverage, yet it is still a wonderful book for anyone looking to study the lesser-known battles of the British Empire. I would also highly recommend the grandly titled <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Oriental Campaigns and European Furloughs</span>, by Colonel E. Maude. It never fails to excite me when I find a personal account of the period I am researching, and Colonel Maude is an enthusiastic writer who adds a wonderfully personal insight to the story.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack has now survived another campaign and has managed to secure the one thing he craves: his own name. With money in his pocket and a longing to see England, he is on his way home. But the British Empire is about to receive its greatest test, as the devil’s wind blows through India, and Jack might not get his wish after all. For mutiny is in the air, and Jack Lark will surely have to fight for his country once again.</p>
