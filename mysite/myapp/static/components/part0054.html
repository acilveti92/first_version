				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The loud voices of the hawkers and the boldest stallholders called to the tall sahib who rode through the packed streets, each begging for his attention with their fantastical promises and unsubtle suggestions. The rider studiously ignored the entreaties, pushing away the bewildering array of objects that were thrust towards him. It made for slow progress along the narrow paved streets that wound their way through the city like a maze, but the rider did not care. He was in no hurry.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He watched a group of small boys playing at marbles as he rode by, their playground a gutter full of filth. The boys were naked save for golden cords around their necks and the gold and silver bangles on their wrists and ankles. One gleeful boy was clapping another hard on the back, the downcast expression on the second boy’s face telling all who had won and who had lost. The crowd of at least thirty other boys were cheering at the tops of their lungs, the loud shouts of ‘khoob! khoob!’ drowning out even the most enthusiastic merchants.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The rider edged his horse around a filthy fakeer who sat plum in the middle of the narrow street, holding his palm aloft to display the scruffy tree growing through the centre of his hand. The manoeuvre took him close to the next stalls, and he was immediately besieged by eager merchants keen to have him part with his money. Yet something in the white-faced rider’s face deterred even the most avaricious stallholder from pressing too close, the beautifully decorated talwar that hung at his hip too well used to be worn solely for decoration.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Authoritarian voices bellowed for attention and the rider edged his horse into a gap between the stalls as a palki pushed through the crowd. The curtains were pulled together, but there was enough of a gap for the rider to snatch a glimpse of a doe-eyed beauty reclining on scarlet cushions, the vision of loveliness disappearing quickly as her bearers jogged past.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He eased his horse back into the throng, taking care to steer a wide path around a group of hard-faced men mounted on sturdy mountain ponies, doing his best to ignore the appraising gazes that ran over him. This was no place for a fight, but still his hand crept to the holstered revolver at his hip, his fingers deftly undoing the buckle that held the flap in place. The gesture did not go unnoticed by the men from the hills. They saw too the anger in the eyes that flashed over them, and they let the stranger past.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The crowd thinned out as the loud calls from the minarets echoed through the tightly packed streets, the faithful called away to prayer. The rider hesitated, as if suddenly unsure of where he was headed, before he pulled off the street and passed through an intricately carved doorway and into an empty courtyard.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The place was an oasis after the jostling crowds of the thoroughfare. A marble fountain tinkled gently, the sound of moving water calming and cooling after the bedlam of the street.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The syces leapt to their feet as the rider eased himself wearily from the saddle, the young boys undoing the straps that held his belongings on his horse’s back before his feet had even hit the ground.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Welcome, sahib, welcome.’ The owner of the hotel came bustling out from a room that overlooked the courtyard, hastily brushing the flakes of pastry from his white robes as he advanced on the tired rider. ‘You have chosen a fine establishment for your stay.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Something in the rider’s flat stare made the owner pause. But he was too eager for the coins in the man’s saddlebags to remain silent for long.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Yes, sahib, this is a fine hotel. I shall give you the best room, yes, the very best room.’ He clapped his hands, shooing the young boys into the whitewashed corridor that led into the interior of the hotel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Now, sahib, let me prepare you some refreshment! I have the very best Bass’s beer, just what you need to clear the dust from your throat. Yes that’s the very thing.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">More servants were sent running from the courtyard as the owner bowed at the waist and ushered the tall visitor into the shady interior of the hotel. ‘This way, sahib. This way.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The grey-eyed rider let himself be shown inside, the marble floors and white walls beautifully cool after the heat of the late-morning sun.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘May I ask your name, sahib?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The tall man stopped and turned to face the owner, fixing him with a penetrating gaze. He let the silence stretch out, causing much hand-wringing from the anxious hotel owner, who wondered what offence the simple enquiry had caused. At last he spoke.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘My name is Fenris.’ The man was curt, his voice clipped. ‘Lieutenant Arthur Fenris.’</p>
