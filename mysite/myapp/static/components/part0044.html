				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The sepoys never stood a chance.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Here and there a subedar managed to gather together enough men to force the Maharajah’s irregular cavalry to veer away, but most of the native soldiers were simply cut down where they stood, butchered by the horsemen who rode them down with cruel precision.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Some tried to run, throwing away their muskets as they made a desperate bid for safety, but there were simply too many horsemen for them to stand a chance. The sepoys were slaughtered, their heads and shoulders sliced open by the sharpened talwars. Dozens were killed in the first few minutes of the attack, flung to the ground to lie like discarded rag dolls, their precious lifeblood soaking into the parched soil beneath their ruined bodies.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Form on me!’ Major Dutton screamed in desperation as he tried to rally the remains of the three shattered companies. ‘On me! On me!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A horseman rode close, his talwar aimed at Dutton’s heart. Before he could get close, Dutton lifted his arm, aiming his revolver with bloodshot eyes. The bullet took the rider in the throat, snatching his body backwards, throwing him from the saddle.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘On me! Spencer, here!’ Dutton saw a hatless Lieutenant Spencer stagger from the melee. The tall officer looked up, and Dutton was given just enough time to see the look of anguish on his face before the young lieutenant was ridden down, a thick pig-sticking spear punched through his stomach from behind.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton bellowed in rage. He emptied his revolver, killing another pair of fast-moving horsemen. He spied one of Gartry’s subedars holding a small group of sepoys together and rode towards them, dodging around the wild hooves of a fallen horse that thrashed the ground in agony, a sepoy’s bayonet driven full length into its chest.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Reload!’ Dutton snapped the command as he forced his horse in among the sepoys. ‘Form two ranks. Front rank, kneel and present bayonets!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The orders came fast as he sought to bring order from the chaos. More men ran to join them, adding weight to the frail formation. Dozens more tried but failed, the Maharajah’s horsemen circling through the valley, cutting down the slowest, spilling still more blood on the arid soil.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Ready!’ Dutton’s hands worked furiously to reload the five chambers on his revolver. ‘Fire!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Fewer than a dozen muskets answered the order, a desultory volley that still managed to knock over a couple of the circling riders. Dutton glanced up quickly before returning his attention to his revolver.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Reload! Front rank, prepare to receive cavalry.’ He snapped his revolver shut and looked around, trying to begin to make sense of the disorder. He heard the ordered commands of a British officer and through a gap in the cloud of powder smoke that billowed across the battlefield he saw the 24th’s square. The redcoats were firing when ready, a stream of musket fire rippling around the tight formation. Their steady fire was exacting a toll on the circling horsemen, who were already backing off, seeking easier targets amongst the scattered ranks of Dutton’s own soldiers, the men he had failed, rather than face the disciplined bayonet walls of the 24th.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton sucked down his shame and his despair. The redcoats were still fighting. All was not lost.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack stood in the centre of the square that inched slowly away from the carnage. Even with only twenty men on each face it was an ungainly manoeuvre, many of the men forced to march either sideways or backwards as they tried to make progress towards the cantonment. The sergeants and corporals were screaming themselves hoarse as they constantly dressed the ranks to ensure they kept a wall of bayonets presented outwards. The redcoats were still firing on the enemy, but there were long gaps between shots, the sheer difficulty of reloading whilst constantly moving slowing their rate. Yet there were still enough muskets to fire on any rider who ventured close, and the irregular cavalry were becoming wary of the white-faced redcoats and their accuracy.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Step but weary step, the 24th were dragging themselves clear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Company! Company halt!’ Jack’s voice cracked as he shouted the order, the foul-smelling powder smoke sucking every last drop of moisture from his parched mouth. He pushed himself into one of the flanks of the square so he could get a better view. The 24th had stopped barely two hundred yards from where they had waited so patiently for the enemy to arrive. Two hundred yards that were now covered with the fallen bodies of the enemy cavalry, the company’s passage marked in blood and spent cartridge wrappers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He took another faltering step away from the safety of the square, unable to fully comprehend what he was seeing.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The enemy riders had gone.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘They’ve gone to loot the cantonment.’ Captain Kingsley elbowed his way out of the square. ‘And you are going to hang.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was too tired to argue. ‘Form the men into column, Kingsley. Let’s get them back whilst we can.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He looked anxiously down the valley, expecting to see the rest of the Maharajah’s force arrive at any moment. He offered a silent prayer of thanks to whichever God had been looking over the redcoats. If they had been facing the Maharajah’s elite troops, then the battle would still be raging. Thankfully, the wild men from the hills were driven as much by the lust for plunder as they were by achieving the military aims of the Maharajah’s lightning strike against Bhundapur. They had fought hard, winning a fabulous victory by destroying the redcoats’ frail line, but when faced with the choice of continuing the fight or being first into the cantonment, they had raked back their spurs and raced for the bungalows and barracks of the British camp, leaving their dead and dying comrades to bleed and suffer in the dust.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Damn you!’ Kingsley spat the words into Jack’s face.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was certain a raised fist would follow the oath, and he instinctively twisted on the spot, his arms rising to defend himself. Yet Kingsley was no fighter, and he took a step backwards, as if he too had expected to see a blow aimed squarely in his direction.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Corporal Jones. Disarm this bastard and guard him. I want him in irons the moment we are back in the barracks.’ Kingsley snarled the order, hiding his fear under a thin veil of anger.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Corporal Jones eased his way through the ranks of men, who stood and stared at the captain. ‘Sir?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Kingsley’s anger flared. ‘Damn you, Corporal. Arrest this man.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Corporal Jones stamped to attention. ‘Sir!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Satisfied, Kingsley turned his back on Jack and stomped angrily into the safety of the square, bawling for Colour Sergeant Hughes to form a company column for the march back to the hastily erected fort that Dutton had insisted on building, and which now offered the redcoats their only hope of sanctuary.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sorry, sir.’ Corporal Jones was apologetic as he reached for Jack’s musket.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack handed over the weapon. ‘Looks like you can drop the “sir” again, Corporal.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jones offered a thin-lipped smile. ‘The man’s a cock.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He’s an officer.’ Jack returned the grin. ‘What else do you expect?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Captain Kingsley! Well done. Well done indeed!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Major Proudfoot stood just outside the temporary wall that had been built from mealie bags and storage crates. He had begun to clap as the weary company from the 24th trudged back, and now he shouted his approval to welcome their return.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Kingsley strode forward, his chin lifting as he accepted the applause. He shook Proudfoot’s hand before turning back to face his command. If either officer saw the scathing looks on the grimy faces of the redcoats, then neither made any remark of it. The two officers stood back and watched as the exhausted soldiers clambered over the three-foot-high defensive wall.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I had to have that bounder Lark arrested. He tried to run.’ Kingsley’s smug expression betrayed his satisfaction at delivering the accusation as Corporal Jones reluctantly brought Jack to stand in front of the two officers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘That’s a bare-faced lie.’ Jack delivered his reply calmly. ‘I saved this fool’s company, although I had to knock him down so I could do it without his damn interference. But his men fought well. They are good soldiers.’ He raised his voice so that the tired redcoats could hear his praise.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot turned to face Captain Kingsley as if Jack had never spoken. ‘Well done, Kingsley. You have delivered your men safely. That is highly commendable under the circumstances, highly commendable indeed.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Corporal Jones cleared his throat noisily.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Corporal. You wish to speak?’ Major Proudfoot lifted an eyebrow as the corporal dared to interrupt.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jones’s face glowed as scarlet as his jacket. It was likely the first time he had ever spoken to anyone as senior as a major. ‘Yes, sir. If you please, sir.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well, out with it.’ Proudfoot was all warmth. He glanced over his shoulder and saw dozens of the 24th watching him, the whites of their eyes bright against the thick caking of dust and sweat that smothered their young faces. ‘Do not be afraid to speak.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Mr Lark didn’t run, sir.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Shut your mouth, Corporal,’ Kingsley interrupted. He stepped forward so that he stood chest to chest with Jones. ‘This is not the time for your damn lies.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Captain Kingsley. Let the man speak.’ Proudfoot’s voice was quiet, but there was no mistaking the authority in his tone.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Kingsley opened his mouth to argue further. ‘I shall not stand here and—’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Let him speak.’ Proudfoot screamed the words. The sudden rage was astonishing, and Kingsley quailed. ‘Please carry on, Corporal.’ Proudfoot was all polite reason again, the sudden flash of bright anger hidden once more.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sir!’ Corporal Jones stood to attention, seeking some familiar security as he dared to speak out. ‘Mr Lark saved us, sir. Not Captain Kingsley. Without Mr Lark I reckon we would all be dead’uns.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Thank you, Corporal.’ Proudfoot turned and smiled warmly at the watching redcoats. ‘I am glad you felt you could speak out. I thank you for your words.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was close enough to see that none of the warmth reached Proudfoot’s eyes. He met the major’s stare, sensing the anger that simmered just below the surface.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Corporal, please carry on.’ Proudfoot gave the order and a relieved Jones stamped his foot once before scurrying away. ‘Captain Kingsley. Mr Lark. Please come with me. We have much to do.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot turned on his heel and walked away.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Behind them, the remnants of Dutton’s command were limping towards the temporary fortress. Less than half of his men were still standing, and the watching redcoats of the 24th saw the horror in the native soldiers’ eyes as they staggered towards the barracks.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton rode in alone. None of his three lieutenants had survived the massacre, and so he returned at the head of his battered command as the sole surviving white officer. Not one of the watching redcoats could meet his eye as he clambered wearily from the saddle, the bitterness of defeat hanging around him like a cloud.</p>
