				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Captain Forbes galloped on to the hillock where the Persian gunners had been butchered. He fixed his attention on Jack and rode straight for him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fenris! Re-form your squadron. Quickly, now.’ He snapped the order before turning and riding away.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had no breath left to reply. His throat was parched and his body felt like it had been battered from head to toe. A thin line of blood traced across his thigh from where the Persian lance had scored into his flesh, and now the wound was starting to hurt in earnest. He closed his eyes, forcing away the tiredness and the pain. The time for rest would come later.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Re-form the ranks.’ He bellowed the command, forcing his spine straight. The small of his back flared in agony, so he sheathed his bloody sword and pressed his fingers into the knotted muscles, trying to relieve some of the ache.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned and saw the two Moore brothers shaking hands. The adjutant had ridden in with the regiment’s commander and had seized the opportunity to share a moment’s contact with his older brother. To Jack’s surprise, he felt a spark of jealousy as he saw the bond between the two men. He had been alone for so long that he could scarcely understand what it would be like to share such an intimate connection. For him, relationships were fleeting, as substantial as a silk veil. They hid the loneliness for a while, nothing more. The thought of his loneliness made him think of Sarah. Although she was married, he sensed that she too was alone. They had clung to each other, aware of each other’s need. He summoned the picture of her face. He smiled as he conjured the spark of life in her eyes that so captivated him. He wanted nothing more than to see her again, to be with her once more. The image faded, the noise of the battle interrupting his thoughts.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He opened his mouth to order his troop commander to his place, but shut it before the words could be formed. He would let the two brothers enjoy each other’s company for a moment longer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Captain Forbes reined in beside him. Jack looked across and saw the strain on the young commander’s face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The regiment is doing well, sir.’ He offered the encouragement, watching Forbes carefully.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thus far, perhaps.’ Forbes kept up his facade. ‘The day is not yet done.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘True.’ Jack wanted to somehow reassure the captain that he was leading his regiment on a day that would live long in its annals. But he did not know the man well enough and he could not find the words that would break down the barrier of unfamiliarity.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The squadron was re-forming. It was slow, the men’s tiredness obvious, their lathered horses close to exhaustion. Yet Forbes was correct. The day was not yet over. The left and centre of the Persian line might have been in full retreat, but its largely untouched right flank was still formed and ready to fight.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Forbes looked Jack hard in the eyes. ‘We have more work to do, Captain Fenris. The Poona Horse are to pursue the enemy infantry. I want us to harry their right flank.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He turned and looked back at his squadron, the ranks now standing silent and ready for orders. They had fought all night and had charged twice that day, but they would not be allowed to rest.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He faced Forbes. ‘We’re ready, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good.’ The commander of the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry offered a tight-lipped smile. ‘We are going to attack over there.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned and pointed to the massed ranks of infantry battalions on the enemy’s flank. The Bombay Lights had fought cavalry and artillery. Now they would face a horseman’s worse fear. They would charge the bayonets of the Persian infantry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The squadron moved quickly and with purpose. They trotted down the hillock and turned to face the enemy’s flank. The two lines of red-coated infantry were close now. Yet they were still too far away to join the fight, the distance too great even for the power of the 64th’s Enfield rifles.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Trot!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The cavalry wheeled to the left as Forbes led them towards the Persians’ surviving flank. Their line was ragged and the files were forced to work hard to maintain their spacings as they realigned the ranks so that they could sweep on to the Persian infantry. The formation lacked the regimental precision with which it had started the day, the effects of the two vicious engagements showing in the bloodstained uniforms that had been slashed and battered by the enemy. Yet they still displayed a purpose that was chilling.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Persian infantry saw them coming. With the rest of their army in disarray and the steady lines of British infantry moving ever closer, the enemy foot soldiers had been forced to begin a long and lonely retreat. Unlike their comrades, the three Sabriz battalions moved in good order, marching in tight columns. They had witnessed the destruction of their artillery and seen their cavalry driven from the field. Yet they were determined to fight on, to show that not all of the Persian force was so easily defeated.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As the British cavalry trotted towards them, the Persian infantry saw only one course of action. The closest battalion, the 1st Khusgai Regiment of Fars, stopped and immediately began to re-form, leaving the rest of their comrades to carry on the retreat. To the hoarse screams of their vekils, the side of the battalion closest to the British cavalry turned to face outwards, the men shuffling into three deep ranks. Around them, the rest of the troops marched to form the other three sides of the square. Calmly and without fuss, the battalion moved into the defensive formation that would keep it safe from the advancing British cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack watched the manoeuvre as the Bombay Lights headed straight for the enemy infantry. He was impressed by the steadiness in the Persian ranks. The infantry battalion had seen its comrades routed, yet still it stood its ground, determined to see off the small band of cavalry that had already caused so much destruction that day.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It was an easy decision for the Persian commander to make. The single squadron of horsemen numbered just over one hundred riders. The square was made up of more than five hundred infantrymen each armed with a musket and a bayonet. The odds were so heavily in the Persians’ favour that not even the sight of so many of their fellows retreating had deterred him from halting and preparing to fight off the remains of the British cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">At any moment Jack expected Forbes to sound the halt, to bring the squadron to an impotent stop, far out of the range of the enemy’s muskets. Yet for a reason Jack could not fathom, the commander of the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry showed no sign of even pausing. The younger Moore rode at his shoulder, the adjutant belatedly drawing a sabre unblemished with blood. The two officers advanced a little way in front of the squadron, their attention focused on the force of Persian infantry that stood resolutely in their path.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Bombay Lights were at least five hundred yards away when the front rank of infantry squatted to the ground, the butts of their muskets rammed hard into the soft, sandy soil, the bayonets held ready to rip out the guts of any horse foolish enough to venture close. Behind them, the two standing ranks presented their muskets, the tips of the bayonets reaching past the heads of the front rank. Still the Bombay Lights rode on. If Forbes ordered the charge, they faced a long gallop right into a volley from the Persians’ muskets. When the horses swerved away from the wall of bayonets, as they surely must, they would be forced to ride past the other sides of the square, giving the rest of the Persian infantrymen the chance to open fire. It would be a massacre. If Forbes ordered the charge, he was committing one hundred men and their horses to certain death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Still they pressed on. The line flowed swiftly across the plain, the steady trot closing the distance with surprising speed. Forbes stayed silent, never once looking away from the square. He sat his horse easily, his sabre held almost casually in his right hand, as if on an afternoon’s hunt rather than heading directly into a Persian volley.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack felt the fear churn in his stomach. He had once taken his place in a square, standing shaking as a force of enemy cavalry rushed towards his company. It was a memory that still haunted his dreams. His men had stood firm, defiant in the face of the enemy horsemen. The square had not broken and they had blasted the cavalry from their saddles as they swirled around them, the horses unable to close on the wall of bayonets. Now he was riding towards a similar formation. He knew what would happen, yet he was powerless to stop it.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He saw Forbes lift his sabre and point it at the sky, preparing to give the command to begin the gallop that would soon give way to the madness of the charge.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack fought off the fear. He went to draw his talwar, but the blood on the blade had congealed in his scabbard and it would not come free. He tugged harder, breaking it loose before he raised it high, mirroring his commander’s gesture.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Bombay Lights!’ Forbes’s voice cracked as he shouted for attention. ‘Bombay Lights!’ The voice hardened, the words coming clear above the noise of the moving horsemen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s exhaustion slipped away as he prepared for the final charge. He had come so far. He had stolen a place in society far above his own and proved that an unwanted child from the foulest rookeries of London could achieve so much more than his station in life allowed. Now he would likely die on a foreign field in the service of his Queen. He glanced round quickly. He saw the look of stony determination on the face of Lieutenant Moore, and the grim expressions of the troopers, who were following their officers into almost certain oblivion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned to face the front, focusing his attention on the tightly packed ranks of Sabriz infantry, who watched in astonishment as the fragile line of blue-coated cavalry advanced to attack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Forbes slashed his sword forward, pointing it at the square.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack repeated the gesture, opening his mouth to echo the order that was about to follow.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was leading his men into battle. There was nowhere else on earth he would rather be.</p>
