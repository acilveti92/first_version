				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Mr Sloames! Mr Sloames, wake up!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was dimly aware of somebody shaking his shoulder but he ignored it. He lay curled on the ground, his eyes open and staring yet seeing nothing. His tears were spent, the only evidence of their passing the thin tracks they had cut into the blood and grime that covered his face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Mr Sloames! We need you! Mr Sloames, can you stand? Are you hurt?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The questions assaulted his fragile peace, forcing him back into the awful reality of the present.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What is it?’ Jack’s voice came out as a croak, the voice of a crotchety old man disturbed from an afternoon sleep.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank God. I thought you were dead. Can you stand, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s battered mind was slowly coming to life. ‘Digby-Brown?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Digby-Brown saw the matted hair on the back of his captain’s head for the first time as Jack gingerly lifted it from the ground. ‘Yes, sir. Goodness me, are you badly hurt?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack ignored the pointless question and waved his arm for assistance. Pain cascaded through his skull as he was hauled upright and dark shadows clouded his vision. Before he could fall, Digby-Brown took a firm grip of his arms.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Crikey, sir. You look awful.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was trying to take an inventory of his injuries. Every single part of his body was in pain and seemed to be leaking blood but, individually, none of the wounds seemed too severe. By some miracle, his body was still in one piece. The same could not be said of his soul.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His awareness was improving with every second. The blind panic and horror triggered by Tommy Smith’s devastated face was receding into the depths of his mind. There it lurked, like some evil monster hidden in the shadows. For the moment it was contained, pushed to one side so that he could start to function again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Mr Sloames?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack pressed his hand into the base of his spine, the comforting habit of kneading his aching back instinctive. He spat out a wad of bloody phlegm and wiped a muck-encrusted hand across his face. ‘Where’s the company?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, sir.’ Digby-Brown looked closely at his captain. A hint of colour had returned to his cheeks and his eyes seemed focused. Digby-Brown withdrew his supporting arm but kept it outstretched in case Sloames began to sway. ‘It’s all a bit of a mess, sir. I’m not quite sure where the rest of the company went.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What about Mr McCulloch and the Second Company?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The last I saw they were heading back towards the Seventh.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Jesus Christ!’ Jack swore as the pressure of his hand on his spine sent a lance of pain down his legs.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown took this as the captain’s verdict on the confusion and disorder. ‘I brought as many of the men as I could find.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You did? Why?’ Jack’s knees were trembling with the effort of keeping him upright.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, to find you, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘To find me?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It seemed like a good idea at the time, sir. I remembered seeing you directing us then I turned round and you had disappeared. I was sure you couldn’t have gone far.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And the men came with you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Willingly, sir. They seemed as keen to find you as I was myself.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Dear God in heaven. What a bloody mess.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Quite frankly, sir, it’s a fucking disaster.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack barely noticed Digby-Brown’s uncharacteristic language. They had all been changed by the day’s bitter events. ‘So what did you have in mind to do next?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I rather hoped you could tell me, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You are right. I can. We are going over there.’ Jack painfully drew his sword.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown’s eyes widened. His captain was pointing his sword directly at the great redoubt which was now swarming with Russian skirmishers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The men Digby-Brown had managed to lead out of the confusion gathered around Jack. He watched them closely. Dodds was there. His lean face was splattered with blood but he had the same look of keen determination he had shown when they captured the redoubt. Next to Dodds stood Welsh Davies, Dawson, Taylor and fifteen other fusiliers from the Light Company. Sergeant Baker was the only non-commissioned officer left and Jack nodded in his direction, acknowledging his presence. There was one face Jack did not recognise, a young fusilier with sunken cheeks and a trace of fluff on his upper lip that betrayed his boyish attempts to grow a moustache.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Who the hell are you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Flanagan, sir. From Fourth Company.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fourth Company? What on earth are you doing here?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I got lost, sir.’ The young fusilier looked around him with huge eyes, nervous of being among strange soldiers even if they did come from his own regiment.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well, as of now you’re in the Light Company. We will need all the help we can get.’ Jack scanned the faces that looked towards him. The weight of the responsibility was heavy, the look of expectation in the grimy faces unnerving. But he met their stares calmly and with determination. He would not let his men down.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We’re going over there.’ Jack pointed his sword for a second time towards the great redoubt. The men nervously flicked their eyes at it but not one murmur of dissent was uttered.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We’re going over there because we captured that damn place and I cannot bear to see our efforts wasted. We fought bloody hard to take it and I’ll see my soul rot in hell before I give it back to the damn Russians without a proper fight.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Only Flanagan looked aghast, horrified that he seemed to have throw in his lot with a group of lunatics.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack fixed him with a grim smile. ‘You’re a lucky man, young Flanagan. Now you get to fight with real soldiers.’ Jack saw the grins on the grimy faces of his men, just as he had intended. ‘Right, Light Company. Extended order. Flanagan, you stay with me. Let’s move.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">What was left of the company shook itself into a skirmish line of barely twenty men.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They were going to attack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The retreat of the Fusilier Brigade towards the Alma was chaotic. The redcoats careered down the slope, all cohesion lost in the race for safety. The Russian skirmishers who had moved into the great redoubt poured fire into their backs, gunning down dozens and adding fresh impetus to the rout. The redcoats had achieved so much that day. They had fought hard and won a great victory, yet left unsupported and exposed, the remnants of the three battalions had simply had enough, their willingness to stand and fight exhausted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As they retreated, the 1st Division finally advanced. The Guards Brigade and the Highland Brigade had endured hours under artillery fire, pinned down on the far bank of the Alma. They had chafed at their impotency, so when the order finally came to advance, they seized upon it and quickly formed up. The Highland Brigade made up the left-hand half of the 1st Division. They would march up a slope clear of debris, their route well to the east of the path taken by the Light Division’s attack on the redoubt. To the right of the Highlanders marched the Guards Brigade, made up from the most famous of all the regiments in the British army. Resplendent in their huge bearskins and with their colours flying, they looked magnificent. They were the elite of the British army, the Queen’s favourites, and they marched with an arrogant pride.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They followed the path the Fusilier Brigade had taken earlier. The route was littered with the dead and the dying but despite this, the ranks of the guards were immaculate, the officers and sergeants ensuring the line remained perfectly in alignment.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was leading his men towards the right flank of one of the battalions of the Guards Brigade, the Scots Fusiliers, aiming to bring his company alongside in time to join in the guardsmen’s assault on the redoubt. His stomach churned yet little of his earlier debilitating fears returned at the idea of a second attack on the vital position. Nothing he could yet experience could possibly be more hellish than what he had already witnessed that day. He led his men with an icy calm, his composure and his determination cleaving his soldiers to him, his firm resolution a rock on to which they could tether their souls.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men of the Light Company were moving fast but their comrades in the Fusilier Brigade ahead of them were retreating faster. The frightened and exhausted rabble bowled towards the steady ranks of the Scots Fusiliers which stood like a breakwater across their path.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Open the files, you bloody fools!’ Jack snarled through gritted teeth. From his vantage point, Jack could see what was about to happen. He pumped his legs as he led his company across the slope, expending strength he did not have in a futile effort to head off the catastrophe that was about to happen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Even as he watched, the remains of the Fusilier Brigade clattered into the line of guardsmen, a jarring collision that made Jack wince even from a hundred yards away. The routing troops had one thought in their mind, to get to the rear and to safety. Not even a battalion of fresh guardsmen could stop them. The retreating redcoats drove into the ranks of Scots Fusiliers, their elbows and boots working to force a path through the line. The guardsmen’s cohesion was gone in seconds. They tried to advance but they could make no headway against the retreat; try as they might, they were like so much flotsam caught in a raging maelstrom.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">One of the British army’s prime battalions had been taken out of action before it could even be brought into play.</p>
