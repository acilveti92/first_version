				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Major Ballard looked unimpressed as Jack deposited a small heap of paper on top of his travelling writing case. ‘Is that all?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes. That’s it.’ Jack cared little for what he had found, his exhaustion after the fight finally getting the better of him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He dumped his weapons and collapsed on to the charpoy pressed against the wall of the tent. As officers on the staff, he and Ballard had been able to lay claim to one of the first tents coming ashore. The navy was working tirelessly to supply the expeditionary force, despite a shortage of the native boats that they had hoped to find to assist with the effort. The small tent, which would ordinarily have housed a single officer, had become the less than salubrious headquarters for Ballard’s intelligence department.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack lay back, not caring that he was filthy dirty. He heard Ballard sniff in disapproval but he left Jack alone and started work on the proceeds of his subordinate’s morning’s work.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The silence stretched out, but Jack was in no mood to talk. He wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and find rest. But the battle was too recent, the memories too fresh. It would take time for him to push them into the corners of his mind where he knew not to go. So he lay back and stared at the ceiling, trying to force the images from his mind and the shame from his heart.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">At last Ballard spoke. ‘Stalker is pleased.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We won. That’s what he wanted. I should bloody hope he is pleased.’ Jack’s reply was flecked with belligerence. He felt his anger building. His commander had greeted him coldly and the reception had got under his skin. He was covered in the grime of the battlefield, his hands caked with the blood of the men he had killed. Ballard was immaculate, his uniform as clean as his soul, and Jack hated him for it.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course we won.’ Ballard snapped his reply, insensitive to Jack’s mood. ‘They had barely two thousand against a full division and half the bloody fleet. We should’ve been able to walk in there and wipe our boots on their doormat without losing so many damn men.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack remembered the terror of leaping into the enemy trenches, the unbridled fear as the air hummed with bullets, the memory of standing alone to lead the 64th out of the shelter of the moat. ‘It was a hard fight. Our men did well.’ He bit his tongue, trying to hold back his fraying temper.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The men did damn well.’ Ballard shot Jack a frosty glare. ‘Do not think that I denigrate the fine effort of our soldiers. They gave us the victory. Not General Stalker, and most certainly not us on the staff.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack grunted in reply. In his experience, generals laid claim to victories no matter what the circumstances.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And do not think I have overlooked your efforts.’ Ballard continued his tirade. ‘I have heard all about your damn exploits. You should not even have been in the fighting.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Where else should I have been?’ Jack snapped the question.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Out of the damn way and obeying the orders I gave you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They needed my help.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What utter claptrap.’ Ballard’s face flushed as his own temper rose. ‘It was not your job. Your orders were to stay out of the way and go in after the assault. If I had known you would want to play the hero, I would have let you rot in a cell in Bombay. I have no need of a soldier. Men who can wield a sword are ten-a-penny round here. Men who can do what you do are not. I suggest you remember that and next time do as you are bloody well told.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack glared back, fighting against the urge to lash out. The image of the boy he had killed flashed into his mind. It shamed him. He had nothing to be proud of. He sighed and did his best to speak in an even tone, his words cutting through the atmosphere that had been building between them. ‘I did what I thought I had to do. It might not be what you ordered, but I could not stand back and watch those men die.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard fixed him with a keen stare. For the first time, Jack saw a grudging respect. ‘Very well. You are a brave man, Jack, if perhaps not a wise one. I would ask you to give my orders more consideration in the future.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded. ‘I’ll try.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard shook his head slowly. ‘You will do more than try. Obey my orders or face the consequences. There is no middle ground. Is that clear?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Jack tried to sound chastised. He was too tired to fight any longer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good.’ Ballard sat back and breathed out as if releasing a hidden tension. ‘So, it appears we have a problem.’ His voice cracked as he revealed what had him so rattled. ‘We have failed.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stop being so damn melodramatic.’ Jack’s patience was wearing thin. ‘How have we bloody failed?’ He did not understand. Ballard had given the general a full account of the defences. They had been just as he had described.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard paused. He stared at the paper in his hand for a long time before looking back at Jack, his eyes betraying the pain of what he had discovered.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The enemy knew we were coming.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course they knew we were coming.’ Jack felt his exhaustion slipping away as his anger rose. ‘We were camped on their bloody doorstep. Their general would have to be bottle-head stupid not to know we were going to launch an attack.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard scowled. ‘They knew more than that.’ He brandished the paper. ‘Our numbers, which battalions would lead the attack, even what Stalker had for bloody breakfast. They knew everything.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack still did not understand. ‘So they knew we would attack. None of that changes anything.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Perhaps it would not have affected the course of the battle, but it still means there is a spy in our camp.’ Ballard threw the paper on to his desk in disgust. ‘At the very heart of our operations.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘How can there be a Persian spy in our camp?’ Jack was tired and he answered more scathingly than he meant to. ‘I rather think we would spot them.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They will not be parading around in their damn uniform.’ Ballard’s reply was biting. ‘They will have a little intelligence.’ He clearly doubted this was a trait shared by his subordinate.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So what are we looking for?’ Jack was finding organising his thoughts like wading through a swamp.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘If I knew that, Jack . . .’ Ballard let the thought go unfinished. ‘What I fear is that the enemy have already succeeded in placing a network of spies around us.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What the hell do you mean by that?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am thinking of a number of spies, all working for a single spymaster. That is what I would do if I were them. Position a web of agents around our operation, all controlled by a single source.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Do you think the Persians are that clever?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course they are. Do not forget they have the Russians working with them. I shouldn’t be at all surprised if the damned Russians control the spies. It would be quite up their street. They know the rules of this particular game better than anyone.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Better than you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard scowled. ‘No. I will find them.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well you haven’t found them yet.’ Jack was quick to snipe.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, Jack. I am fully aware that it is my job to prevent the enemy infiltrating our establishment. So that makes this my failure.’ For the first time, Ballard’s emotions were revealed. Despite his carefully constructed facade, there was a hint of shame in his voice.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack finally understood. Ballard blamed himself for the hard fight. Jack had been unfair. The major might not have smelt the smoke of the battlefield or slashed his sword at the enemy, but he still had blood on his hands.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You were not to know.’ Jack grimaced even as he spoke. He had never been good at delivering the polite blandishments that were expected of him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard fixed him with a withering stare. ‘It’s my job, Jack. I am supposed to bloody know. Fetherstone will be sure to make the most of it. As soon as he hears of this, that goddam man will demand my head.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s easy to say what should have happened. It isn’t the same as doing it yourself.’ Jack’s voice was full of scorn. He was beginning to understand Ballard’s dislike of the commodore.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fetherstone always has an opinion.’ Ballard was bitter. ‘He pokes his finger into every damn pie yet never damn well bakes one himself.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard went quiet. He stared at the paper on his desk, as if rereading it would somehow change things. Then he stood up abruptly and stalked across the tent to take a bottle of vodka from his knapsack. He lifted the bottle to his lips and took a huge draught before offering it to Jack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack accepted the bottle and took a more circumspect sip. He had never favoured raw spirits: a childhood spent dishing out the vile gin his mother supplied had turned him away from the taste of anything other than wine or beer. Yet the harsh liquor felt good as it burned down his throat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So at least we now have proof that there is a spy at the heart of this operation.’ Ballard sat back down and picked up the sheet of paper he had been reading.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘How can you be so sure?’ Jack’s voice rasped with the after-effect of the fiery liquid.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You found the evidence yourself.’ Ballard passed the single sheet of wafer-thin paper to Jack. A fine copperplate script flowed across the page, the tightly spaced lines written in tiny letters.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack read the letter slowly. It told of the British army’s preparations, listing the battalions with their current strengths, the number of cannon, the ready supply of ammunition, the details of the support ships and all manner of other details about the expeditionary force. Worst of all, it told of Stalker’s intention to attack at Reshire; the expected dates, timings, forces, everything. The enemy had known every detail of the assault.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Who wrote this?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That, Jack, is the question. You might want to read the last paragraph on the second side.’ Ballard sat back in his chair before dropping his head into his hands.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack did as he was told and flipped the page. It took him a moment to find the passage Ballard had mentioned. When he did, he felt an icy hand place a grip around the back of his neck. The paragraph spoke of a formerly unknown captain of hussars who had appeared on the staff of the intelligence department. It was a brief reference, nothing more than two short sentences, yet it still made for hard reading. The author of the revelatory letter had damned Jack with a succinct turn of phrase, referring to him as a loutish rogue who was probably no more than a hired thug.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard winced as he saw Jack’s face. ‘Do you still doubt we have a problem?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No.’ Jack wanted to scrunch the paper into a ball, but he contented himself with tossing it back on to Ballard’s blotter. ‘So who the hell is it?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I would give a great deal to know that.’ Ballard took the sheet of paper and lifted it close to his nose, as if he could discern the writer’s identity from a closer inspection of the ink. ‘But it is our job to find out and we had better do it damn fast.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And how do we do that?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You are full of questions.’ Ballard closed his eyes as he thought. ‘I have a few spies of my own and—’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You do?’ Jack interrupted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Really, Jack. Do you think I am a fool? I got to the bottom of your sorry little tale without too much difficulty, so it shouldn’t surprise you that I know what I am about.’ Ballard was condescending. ‘I know my job, do not ever doubt that.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack bowed his head. Ballard was right to remind him of his place.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They have yet to provide anything useful.’ Ballard snorted as he acknowledged his lack of success. ‘Palmer has been in touch with a few of them. I have good reports on the enemy forces. I have nothing on any spy network.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had wondered where Ballard’s shadow had been. He had barely seen the bodyguard since they had arrived. It was a sharp reminder that he did not know all of Ballard’s affairs, something he would do well to remember.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘With Palmer engaged, it will fall to you to assist me here.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded. He did not know how he could help, but Ballard’s scorn had shamed him. He was determined to prove himself useful, to demonstrate that he possessed the wit, and the ability, to be more than just a killer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard was watching him closely. ‘You will have to be circumspect. I cannot have you blundering around like a bull in a china shop, and there had better be no more of your damn belligerence.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I understand.’ Jack was thinking of Sarah. She was well connected. Perhaps he could use her to help him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You had better. Do not make me regret giving you this chance.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I won’t.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We shall see.’ Ballard’s gaze rested on him. ‘We shall see. So I expect you heard that the fleet bombarded the town of Bushire and forced them to surrender?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I did.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That gives us a secure foothold here. The navy will keep us supplied and Stalker will use the next week or two to build up the army’s strength and prepare for a longer attack into the interior. That’s if he is not replaced.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Is that likely?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard puffed out his cheeks and sat back in his chair, placing his hands behind his head. ‘I would say it is now inevitable. He won his victory but the cost was too high. Colonel Malet of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry died in the assault, and we lost two other officers from the 20th. Worse, Brigadier Stopford from Stalker’s own staff was killed. You simply cannot lose a Companion of the Bath and still consider yourself to have fought a small skirmish. I’m of the opinion that the government will now regard this as a more serious venture than they first thought. They will either need to hold us here indefinitely or reinforce us. If they choose the latter, Stalker is not senior enough to command more than a single division, so they must send a new commander-in-chief.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Poor Stalker.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He will not take it well.’ Ballard did not sound overly concerned at the notion. ‘He is doing his best to ensure he stays in command. He has written his dispatch praising every damn person he can think of. He is even recommending an officer from the 64th for one of the new Victoria Cross medals for bravery. A Captain Wood.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled as he remembered the officer who had beaten him to the top of the wall. ‘Wood fought well. He deserves to be recognised.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stalker also mentions another officer who led the assault and who many are saying inspired the victory. He has asked me if I know who it might be, so that he can be recommended for the same medal.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked at Ballard keenly. ‘What did you tell him?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What do you think I told him?’ For the first time since Jack had returned, Ballard smiled. ‘I said I had no idea who it might be. I had no one involved in the assault so this mysterious figure could not possibly have come from my department.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled despite the disappointment. ‘You bastard.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard laughed off the insult. ‘You don’t exist, Jack. I can hardly have you listed in the damn dispatches. But you did well. All things considered. Well done.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack threw back his head and laughed. If he had been a real officer, he would now be basking in the glory of receiving the newly conceived medal that was the highest accolade for bravery. But such a fate was denied him. He was no more than a charlatan masquerading as an officer. His only thanks would be a sarcastic nod from the man who had ordered him to stay out of the battle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So what now?’ he asked, reaching to take back the bottle of vodka.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Now?’ Ballard smiled wolfishly. ‘Now we find the enemy spies. I don’t care if there are one or a hundred. We will find them all.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And then?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Then you can kill them. Slowly.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack nodded in agreement. He was never going to receive a medal. He would have to find satisfaction in other, more visceral ways. He would hunt down those who had given the enemy the information that had certainly led to the deaths of many redcoats.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Then he would do the job he had been brought all this way to do.</p>
