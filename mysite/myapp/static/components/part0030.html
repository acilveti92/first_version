				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Reveille sounded in the darkness. The bugle call was picked up and repeated throughout the three armies, strident and remorseless, demanding immediate action.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British army scrambled to its feet, resembling an anthill that had been poked violently with a stick. They were still woefully unprepared for the long-awaited march. Despairing officers tried to organise their commands and bring order from the confusion, a hopeless endeavour made worse by the ill-informed staff officers to whom they turned for orders.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To the bewilderment and consternation of their French allies, the British were not ready to march at four o’clock as had been agreed the previous evening, nor were they ready at five o’clock. As the early-morning light pushed away the darkness the chaos in their lines was all too apparent.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The failure of the British commissariat was complete. Seven hundred wagons had been expected but barely one-third of that number had arrived. Mountains of supplies would have to be abandoned where they lay. The more enterprising soldiers were taking advantage of the disorder by pilfering the stores, filling their pockets and their greatcoats with extra rations, adding more confusion and delay.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Dealing with the mountains of stores was not the only task left outstanding. There were dozens of sick to be stretchered back to the beach and handed into the dubious care of the army’s medical staff. Water still had to be found for the soldiers’ canteens, no easy task given that the few wells that had been dug now produced only a little brackish water. Rations waited to be distributed, the meat to be carried raw, no time left for the soldiers to cook the salted pork that was all the army provided. The British army was in total disarray.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The French looked on appalled. Their bandsmen bugled and drummed impatiently, as if the martial music could inspire, cajole or shame their maddeningly disorganised allies to order. The French troops had been ready to march since before dawn. They sat despondently on the ground, wondering at the sanity of their masters who had tied their fate to the bungling British.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The coolness of the early morning gradually melted way, the heat building steadily as the sun rose. Miraculously, at nine o’clock in the morning, the British army was finally ready to march. The redcoats had muddled their way to readiness, the enterprise and industry of the battalion officers succeeding where the professionals in the commissariat had failed so completely.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In all their martial splendour, the armies of three countries would march directly for the Russian port of Sevastopol, the key objective of the campaign. Sunlight glinted off metal, battalion colours were unfurled, uniforms of every colour were massed in ranks of infantrymen, guardsmen, fusiliers, grenadiers, gunners, hussars, dragoons and lancers. It was a sight to stir the heart of even the most reluctant soldier.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The French would march on the right flank, with the sea and the might of the two navies on their right. With the French marched Suleiman Pasha and his six thousand Turkish soldiers. The British would march on the left. To smooth the ruffled feathers of the French generals, Raglan, ever the politician, had acceded to their demands to dictate the order of the march. Perhaps the politics of the joint command had distracted the British commander. Or perhaps Raglan saw no danger in the station the British had agreed to occupy in the combined column. Whatever the reason, the British marched with their left flank dangerously exposed. In the days of Wellington, cavalry outriders would have been despatched to patrol and protect the exposed flank. Intrepid young officers on fast, corn-fed horses would ride into the wide plains, probing for danger, so that no enemy formation could approach the open flank undetected. But Wellington was dead and the British army marched in one compact mass, its flank exposed save for a thin screen of light cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But this was not the morning for doubts. Led by their colours the British soldiers left their fears, their misgivings and their complaints behind them, the brave and stirring tunes from their regimental bands propelling them forward.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The cavalry led the way, the dandies and the aristocrats at the fore, their horses prancing in the excitement. Lord Cardigan, with the 13th Light Dragoons and the 11th Hussars, formed the vanguard of the army. His bitterest enemy, Lord Lucan, who also happened to be his brother-in-law and his commanding officer, led the 8th Hussars and the 17th Lancers on the left flank.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Behind them marched the Rifle Brigade, the feared Greenjackets who had once so tormented Napoleon’s veterans on the battlefields of Portugal, Spain and France. Then, the Greenjackets had been the acclaimed masters of the skirmish line. Now, their descendants were desperate to prove their superiority once again, even in the modern world where every soldier bore the once coveted power of the rifle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Behind them came the infantry, the men Wellington so harshly titled the scum of the earth. They were the least regarded yet the most important of all the troops that marched that day, for it was the humble redcoat who would decide the fate of the battle to come. Victories were not won by the glamorous cavalry, or by the hard-bitten professionalism of the rifles. Even the deadly killing machines of the artillery would not decide who was victorious. Battles were won by the tenacity, the bravery and the sheer bloody-mindedness of the massed ranks of the infantry. Whether they were guardsman, fusiliers, grenadiers, or just plain redcoated infantrymen, all battles came down to their ability to deliver the power of their massed volleys, their willingness to endure the carnage inflicted upon them and the raw courage that would see them close to butcher the enemy with their bayonets.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The King’s Royal Fusiliers marched at the head of the Light Division. The fusiliers had suffered their fair share of disorder that morning. Many of the men marched with half-full canteens of water or with barely enough rations to last them the day. Yet they marched with pride. It was a day to savour being a fusilier in the service of the Queen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack marched proudly at the head of his company. It was hard for him not to look smug so he did not even try, instead merely nodding his head in acknowledgement of the scowls of his brother officers whose men marched inadequately prepared. The Light Company marched with full canteens of water, and the sergeants and corporals carried numerous spares. Their ration bags were full and Tommy Smith even marched with one of his spare stockings crammed full of tea liberated from one of the many abandoned supply chests. One company, at least, would not be going short.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers’ band struck up the opening bars of ‘Cheer, Boys, Cheer!’ It was a firm favourite in the battalion and Jack grinned as he heard the men begin to sing in their deep and surprisingly melodic voices.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The company had come a long way in the few days since they had landed. The men now marched with a cocky air about them, a sureness that had been missing earlier. Watching them, Jack could almost believe they took a certain pride in being one of the first troops to have engaged the enemy. Only the looming presence of Slater cast a shadow over his own confidence.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned and saw the enormous redcoat marching easily in his allotted station, his long, loping stride and confident demeanour a reminder of the man’s power. If the whole company had, at first, been wary of the new arrival, now they were openly fearful of him. The loss of his sergeant’s stripes had added a chilling bitterness to the man and not even the boldest redcoat wanted to spend a moment in his company.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The first Light Company fusilier collapsed shortly before the march was one hour old. Fusilier Macclesbridge had been convinced he had been dying for days. His messmates, long used to his complaints, ignored his whines and daily litany of distress. If Macclesbridge was not complaining of dying of thirst then he was starving to death. He did not get a fever without being certain he had got the plague. That morning he had woken convinced that he had the cholera and his comrades had laughed at his malingering ways. Yet this time he was right. One moment he was cursing as the men marching around him belted out the chorus to ‘The Girl I left Behind’, the next his face darkened and he stumbled forward, crashing into the back of the man in front and falling to the ground choking on a torrent of vomit that erupted from his throat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Macclesbridge was the first to fall but he was not the last.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The heat of the sun cooked the fusiliers in their thick woollen coats, stewing them in a soup of sweat that chafed their skin. Another two men from the company collapsed before midday, unable to find the strength to march under the maddening heat. After the first few hard miles, barely one fusilier had more than a few mouthfuls of warm brackish water left in his canteen. The march had barely begun but already the men trudged in misery.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They soon marched in silence, the joy of the early morning forgotten. The bandsmen had been forced to stow their musical instruments and carry out their secondary role as stretcher-bearers, hauling the sick out of the line of march lest they be trampled into the dust by the never-ending procession that ground its way forward. All too soon, the bandsmen were overwhelmed by the sheer number of men falling to the ground and by the dozens of redcoats who were too weak to rise to their feet after the halts that were now being called every half hour.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The pace of the march slowed to barely a crawl. The ground behind and to either side of the army became littered with abandoned equipment and with the crumpled forms of those unable to carry on. Men sank to their knees in delirium, their anguished cries for water breaking the hearts of their mates who could do nothing but march on and leave them to the less than tender mercies of the overworked bandsmen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"> After another hour picking their way through the detritus that littered the path ahead of them, the fusiliers could march no more. The men fell out, before the order was given, many sinking to the ground where they stood.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The army was disintegrating. The heat and the cholera threatened to end the campaign after barely ten miles.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack observed the pale faces of his men as they sank to the ground. He saw their drawn, haggard expressions, their mouths tinged blue from dehydration. Worst of all was the listlessness and the exhaustion in their eyes. It would be a relief to sink to the ground with them, to give in to the pain that wracked his body. A terrible thirst tormented his every thought. Anything was preferable to the torture of carrying on in this living hell. But Jack refused to give in. Everything he had gone through since the army had landed a few short days ago would be for naught if he gave in to the demands of his battered body.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A mocking laugh caught his attention. Jack turned his head to see which of his men had the energy to find something in this terrible situation to laugh about. Sitting to one side of the company, Slater took a long drink from a full canteen, carelessly letting drops of the precious water spill from his mouth. Against his will, Jack licked his cracked and swollen lips, helpless in the face of his desire to drink. He could smell the water, the mere thought of drinking made his body tremble with desire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater watched the company’s reaction as he drank. He lowered the canteen slowly, his lips wet from the long draught. He leisurely wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and belched. The men turned away.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack watched the performance, his hands clenching into fists at his impotence to deal with the bastard’s mockery. Slater would pay for this particular pantomime, as he would pay for all his violent thuggery.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But revenge would have to wait. With the column of infantry stalled, staff officers galloped backwards and forwards to rouse the men, the flanks of their tired mounts lathered in sweat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘To your feet!’ Colonel Morris shouted. On horseback, the colonel looked imposing. His charger was huge, jet-black save for a white blaze on its forehead and of such an evil temper that only the colonel could ride him. Now the fine horse was streaked with sweat, its eyes rolling in their sockets as Morris paraded him past the slumped ranks of his battalion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘On your feet, my boys! On your feet my brave, brave boys!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack expected the colonel’s call to go unheeded but, to his surprise, the men dug deep into their reserves of strength and struggled to their feet once more, responding to their beloved colonel. Like an army of the dead, the fusiliers rose from the ground and stumbled back into formation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s it, my boys!’ Morris applauded the effort, encouraging his men as best he could. ‘I am proud of you. Proud of all of you,’ he shouted, moving up and down the flank of the column that was slowly taking shape. ‘That’s the way. It will be time to rest soon enough. But not now. One more effort. One more march.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A handful of staff officers came galloping back down the length of the infantry column, their urgency attracting the attention of those fusiliers with enough strength to still be interested in their surroundings.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">One, a cornet from the 7th Hussars, reined in hard alongside Colonel Morris. The hussar officer’s bay horse skittered nervously, moving in a tight half-circle, as the cornet leant forward in his saddle to hand a piece of paper to Morris.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The colonel scanned the paper quickly, his brow furrowing. His eyes darted across the few short lines before he looked up, his leathery face creasing into a smile.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘This is it, boys!’ he shouted, standing in his stirrups to call down the length of the battalion. ‘The Russians are ahead!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian bear had stirred. The road to Sevastopol was blocked.</p>
