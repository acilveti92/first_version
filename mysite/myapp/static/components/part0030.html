				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">A figure burst out of the bush to Jack’s left. He was dressed in a filthy robe that might once have been white but was now torn and stained to a muddy grey. Yet the flash of his talwar was bright as he rushed forward, his mouth open wide in a war cry.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack twisted in the saddle, yanking on the reins as he tried to turn to face the sudden threat. The ambusher was on him the moment his horse slowed. There was no time to react and he could only watch in horror as the bandit raised his weapon. The talwar slashed forward, the blade flashing once in a beam of sunlight before it thumped into the neck of Jack’s horse.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The beast screamed in agony as the weapon ripped through its flesh, blood gushing from the dreadful wound. The stricken animal pumped its legs, still trying to obey its rider’s command. Yet it was too badly wounded. Its forelegs buckled, its strength failing fast.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack pushed against the saddle as he felt the horse going down, kicking the poor beast mercilessly as he struggled to get free. For one dreadful moment his boot stuck in a stirrup, but he ripped it out and threw himself to one side, thumping painfully into the muddy ground. In an instant he had scrambled to his feet, ignoring the flash of agony that followed the jarring impact, knowing he had only moments before he would have to fight for his life. As soon as he found his footing, he brought the heavy shaft of his pig-sticking spear across his body, his hands locked liked claws into the thick wood. He had barely a moment to plant his feet on the slippery ground before the ambusher was on him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The talwar slashed forward, a controlled swipe at Jack’s neck that he parried with the shaft of his spear. The bandit leered as he attacked again, his mouth twisted with hate. The blows came fast now, attack following attack with such speed that Jack was denied any chance to counter, his bamboo spear hacked and splintered as he was forced to block blow after blow.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He was being driven steadily backwards, forced to give ground as the bandit came at him relentlessly. Somehow he kept his composure, an eerie calm descending on him as he fought. He read his opponent’s intentions in his eyes and each time he was able to place the thick shaft of his spear in the right place to counter the vicious blows. He defended patiently. Waiting for the chance to strike back.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The bandit’s foot came down on a patch of sodden earth layered with a slimy crust of brown mould. It took him no more than a heartbeat to feel himself beginning to slip, but it gave Jack the opening he had been waiting for. The instant he realised what had happened, he whipped the spear around so the point was at his assailant’s stomach, then stamped his foot forward just as he had been taught in a hundred sessions on the grey, damp training grounds of England, using the spear as an improvised bayonet and musket.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">An explosive grunt was torn from his mouth as he thrust the sharp point into the bandit’s stomach. The heavy spear was designed to pierce the tough hide of a wild boar, and it punched into the man’s body with ease. He tore the spearhead free from the wound and thrust again, mercilessly hammering it past the man’s hands, which were desperately trying to wave it away. The tip tore through the man’s throat, ripping a grotesque hole in his neck, the sudden eruption of blood bright red against the backdrop of matted jungle.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt no shame at his vicious assault. There was no time for remorse now that the ambush had been sprung. As the first bandit dropped to the ground, he was already turning to find where the rest of the shadowy figures had gone.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The sounds of combat came from no more than a dozen yards away, but the dense undergrowth prevented Jack from having a clear view of exactly who was fighting whom. He had no idea who had come to attack the hunters, but he did not care. There would be time for understanding later. Without a backward glance he charged towards the noise. It was time to see how the arrogant young man was faring against an opponent who fought back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The shouts of anger and confusion grew louder as Jack ran. The thick swathe of jungle masked some of the sounds, the dense vegetation muffling even the harsh noise of combat. It made it unlikely that any of the other groups of hunters would be able to hear the fight. Jack knew then that he and his three fellow spears were on their own.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">As he burst from the undergrowth, he realised that a desperate struggle was taking place. Two of the riders were still in the saddle. Their horses reared and plunged as a press of bodies circled around them, looking for an opportunity to attack. The third horse was down and Jack could see nothing of the rider beneath the hacking talwars of three bandits. A dozen bandits were attacking the three horsemen, each as filthy and dishevelled as the one Jack had already struck down. Only one wore black robes.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt nothing of the madness that had erupted from the blackest depths of his being at the Alma. In its place was coldness, his rational mind holding sway against the insanity of battle. He tasted the bitter tang of fear, the gut-churning horror that he could be about to die. Yet still he threw himself forward without hesitation, gambling on violence and speed to overwhelm the attackers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He leapt over a fallen log and rammed his heavy spear into the back of one of the bandits circling the riders. A thin mail coat over heavy blue robes protected the man, but the vicious spear punched through it all as if it were silk. The force of the attack drove the spear clean through the man’s body, the tip erupting in a gory explosion from his stomach, his anguished howl of horror the last sound he would ever make.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was drawing his new talwar even before the man had hit the ground, abandoning the heavy spear now that it was inextricably embedded in the man’s body. The bandits’ heads whirled around at the unexpected assault from the darkness of the jungle, their eyes showing white under their tightly bound pagdis. His second target had no longer than a single heartbeat to glimpse his attacker. It was time enough for his mouth to gape open in shock before Jack’s talwar slashed across his neck, ripping out his throat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The proud young nobleman roared as Jack flew into the bandits like a berserker of old. The boy was brave, fighting hard. He spurred his horse forward, using the confusion that Jack’s attack had caused to thrust his spear down into the breast of one of his assailants.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His companion was not so lucky. The black-robed Tiger sensed his men’s fear at the sudden assault and pushed himself to the fore, striding into the vicious battle. His heavy talwar drove forward, cleaving the closest rider’s spear in two, the raw power of the assault unstoppable. The terrified hunter dropped the ruined weapon and reached for his own talwar, but the Tiger was simply too fast. Recovering his sword from the blow, he brought it around in a glittering arc above his head before smashing it across the mounted hunter’s breast. The talwar drove deep, tearing a wide gouge that gushed forth a torrent of blood. The man toppled silently from the saddle, two of the bandits pouncing before he had stopped moving, driving their own blades into his dying body.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack fought on, slashing his sword forward, only to scream in frustration as his next victim turned in time and parried the blow, driving both blades wide. Jack ignored the wild defence and stamped forward into the opening, slamming his head forward so it crashed viciously into his opponent’s face. The bandit crumpled, his nose pulped, the blood smothering the hands that he clutched to his battered face. Jack was merciless and he immediately thrust his sword down, piercing the man’s body as it fell, driving the tip through his back and into his heart.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A shriek of horror came from Jack’s right and he twisted on the spot, his latest victim already forgotten. The young man who had thought nothing of insulting the white-faced stranger had finally been thrown from his horse, the brave beast succumbing at last to the dozen wounds it had taken. The youngster hit the ground, his sword knocked from his grasp as he crunched with bone-jarring force on to the jungle floor. Two bandits came at him the moment he fell, their teeth bared in delight, like a pair of wolves going for the kill, their swords thirsting to be buried in his flesh.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">All trace of the boy’s arrogance was gone. His face was ashen with fear as he looked up and saw the bandits charging towards him, death in their wild eyes, and he screamed in horror, his terror bright in the darkness of the jungle.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack threw himself at the boy’s attackers, no time for anything other than a wild charge. Leaping over the body of the first man he had slain, he lowered his shoulder and hit one of the men with a force that knocked him sprawling to the floor. The impact nearly threw Jack off his feet, and he stumbled, lurching to one side, fighting to stay upright; it saved his life.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The second bandit had a moment to react to Jack’s sudden arrival, and he used it to redirect his blow, turning his blade in mid-air so that it sliced across Jack’s path. The blade keened as it stung the air before scoring a thin line across his fine new uniform coat, missing his stomach by no more than half an inch. Had he not slipped, he would have been sliced in two.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack threw himself forward despite the flash of fear as he saw the blade whisper past his stomach, and crashed into the man who had so nearly killed him, knocking him violently to the ground. He felt the man’s body underneath his own, and immediately drove his elbow down, smashing it into the bandit’s windpipe. It was a vicious blow, the kind so common in the gutter fights he had been brought up with, and it crushed the bandit’s throat, choking him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">There was no time for pity. Jack sensed movement behind him and pushed himself to his knees, using the choking bandit’s body for leverage. By some miracle he had managed to keep a firm grip on his talwar, and he slashed the blade around his waist, using its momentum to bring him face to face with the new threat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The talwar rang with a violent impact that jarred Jack’s already battered sword arm. His instinct had saved him. As he spun around on his knees, he saw that he had driven his sword into the side of the bandit he had knocked to the floor. The man had quickly scrambled to his feet thinking to bury his own sword in Jack’s unprotected back. Instead he had been cut down, his intended victim turning with an astonishing speed. Jack saw the man’s shock before he fell face first to the ground, his body giving a single violent shudder before it lay still.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack hurt. The twin collisions sent waves of pain scoring through his veins. Stabbing his talwar down into the ground, he forced himself to his feet. As he rose, he saw the look of astonishment on the young nobleman’s face, terror alive in his wide-eyed stare. There was no time to spare the young man a word. Jack hauled the astonished boy upright. He might be young, but Jack would need all the help he could muster if he were to bring them both out alive.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">For the fight was far from over. Jack had fought hard and saved one of his fellow spears from death. But he had spied the man in the black robes and he now knew who was attacking them. If he were to somehow save them both, he would have to face the man who had already bested him once in combat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He would have to face the Tiger.</p>
