				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Come on. This way.’ Jack called over his shoulder to Knightly as he made his way towards one of the few doorways that led off the fort’s central courtyard. He had no idea where he was going, but he could see a few windows above the doorway and it seemed the most likely direction.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Behind them, the redcoats were still piling over the ramparts. The 2nd Bombay Light Infantry had followed the 64th into the chaos of the assault, and now both battalions scoured the fort for any remaining enemy soldiers. Those they found they killed, their bayonets ending the last resistance without mercy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In desperation, a handful of the beaten defenders took to the cliffs behind the fort, many plunging to their deaths as they tried to flee the victorious redcoats. The only alternative escape route was a network of steep ravines away to the west. As the redcoats piled into the fort, these gullies and slopes were filled with those sarbaz lucky enough to survive the assault. Yet even here there was to be no sanctuary.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As the enemy fled, Stalker released his cavalry, ordering them forward to harry the fugitives. The ground was poor and it would deny the cavalrymen the opportunity to massacre the fleeing infantry, yet they went forward willingly, the raucous call of their buglers urging them onward. Even from within the courtyard, Jack could hear the whoops and yells as they rode down any of the Persian infantrymen they could find, pursuing the remnants of the enemy force, their bloody sabres inflicting still more casualties on the broken ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack pushed open the heavy wooden door with his boot, his muscles tensing as he half expected an enemy soldier to attack him the moment his hiding place was revealed. To his relief, the darkened interior was empty. He took a tentative step forward and peered inside. The small anteroom behind the door contained a number of ammunition crates, the wax paper that had protected the cartridges now scattered around the room. A single wooden staircase led upwards, and Jack felt a prick of fear as he realised he would have to scale it if he were to obey Ballard’s orders and seek out any important documents before the Persians had time to destroy them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned and saw that Knightly had followed him inside. The lieutenant’s face was pale as he walked into the ammunition store, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down as he too looked at the dark stairway. For the first time, Jack noticed that Knightly’s drawn sabre was still clean, the steel unblemished by blood.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Are we going up?’ The lieutenant’s knuckles showed white as he gripped the handle of his sabre. He sounded like a small boy asking for permission to be taken to bed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’ll go first. Stay back in case I have to fight.’ Jack gave the instructions in the clipped tones of an officer. There was no doubt who was in charge. ‘Have you fired your revolver?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly shook his head and unbuttoned the flap of his holster before holding the weapon by the barrel and offering it to Jack. ‘I never had the occasion to use it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack holstered his own empty gun before taking Knightly’s. ‘Is it loaded?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course.’ Knightly spoke softly. He looked crestfallen, as if Jack had somehow questioned his bravery.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stay close,’ Jack flashed Knightly a rakish smile, ‘and follow me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The stairs turned to the right. The central wooden column blocked Jack’s sword arm. If he were forced to fight, any defender would have the advantage of both height and the unrestricted movement of his own sword. It was just as the architect of the fort had planned. It was a design mirrored throughout the globe, from the dusty, damp stone fortresses of England to the splendid maharajah citadels of Hindustan.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack crept up the stairs, Knightly’s revolver held steady in his left hand, the barrel pointing upwards. He would not hesitate to fire if necessary. In such an enclosed space the revolver would be deadly. He smiled as he tiptoed up the creaking stairs; the stopping power of the modern handgun had made a mockery of the antique defences.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He attempted to hide the soft scuffle of his heavy boots in the din of battle that still echoed through the fort. Yet no matter how hard he tried, every step seemed to thump against the ancient wood, so that it sounded as if an elephant was marching up the stairs. He paused and sucked in a deep breath, listening carefully, his ears straining to hear if anyone waited around the next turn of the staircase. He heard nothing. He closed his eyes and screwed his courage tight. He had endured enough pussyfooting around.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fucking hell!’ He roared at the heavens as he threw himself forward, bounding up the staircase, taking the steps two at a time as he gave up the slow, nerve-stretching pace and gambled everything on violence and surprise. His boots thumped hard into the wood. He felt the effort pull at his thigh muscles and his breath rasped in his lungs in the moments before he burst round the last turn and into the simple room that mirrored the ammunition store below.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The scream took him by surprise. It was the piercing wail of terror released. He stumbled into the room, his eyes roaming the gloom for the source of the terrible sound. He heard Knightly crashing up the stairs behind him, yet there was no time to wonder if the lieutenant was close enough to help.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A flicker of motion caught Jack’s eye and he twisted on the spot, his left hand swinging the revolver round in one smooth motion. He saw the flash of a weapon and pulled the trigger. The cough of the revolver was deafening, the sound echoing off the walls. He fired for a second time as he saw the rough outline of a figure stagger towards him. There was no time for thought, and he pulled the trigger once more, sending a third bullet into his assailant.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He stood still, his right hand tensed as he prepared to bring up his talwar, ready for the attack his instincts told him was coming. Yet none appeared. The silence stretched out, the quiet after the gunfire shrouding him. He ran his eyes around the room, searching for danger. He saw none; saw no one other than Knightly, who stepped belatedly into the room, his face ashen with fear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked down at the figure that had leapt out at him. He supposed that the body now lying stretched out on the floor had been the source of the dreadful shriek of terror that had so set his nerves on edge. He saw the rusty sword that had caught his eye, the blunted edge and chipped tip that he had perceived as a threat. The robes the figure wore had once been white, but the simple cloth was now stained with so much blood that it had turned almost completely red. Jack’s aim had been true, each of the three bullets tearing a huge hole in the slight body that had sought to ambush him. The corpse belonged to a young boy, no more than fourteen or fifteen years old. A childish dream of being a warrior now drowned in blood.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack sighed and turned away from the pathetic sight, forcing away the bitterness that threatened to crush him. Refusing to acknowledge the emotion that surged through him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly walked cautiously towards the corpse, as if uncertain whether the boy was alive or dead. He looked down in silence as he contemplated the victim of his friend’s deadly skill.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You killed him.’ The lieutenant struggled to speak. He gagged as he broke the silence, as if the words physically sickened him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack said nothing. He stalked across the floor towards a simple kitchen table positioned opposite the room’s single window. Its top was smothered with stacks of paper. More was dumped carelessly on a battered dresser rammed hard into the corner behind the table. Jack had discovered what he had been sent to find.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He was just a boy.’ Knightly still stood over the body of the child. His sabre was held low in his hand, as if it was suddenly too heavy for the young officer to carry. ‘He wasn’t much older than me, yet you blew him apart.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack laid the smoking revolver on a pile of paper and began to sift through the documents.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You killed him, damn you!’ Knightly raised his voice as he repeated the accusation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The boy had fallen so that he lay on his back. Jack’s bullets had hit him in the body, leaving his face untouched. His young features were twisted into a dreadful teeth-bared grin of terror. His upper lip was flecked with fine hairs that he had not yet been old enough to shave away. Dark ringlets curled down from his temples to whisper across his face, some errant strands catching and sticking in his staring eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He tried to kill me.’ Jack’s veneer of composure snapped. ‘Now get a fucking grip and help me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly shook his head, trying to dispel the nightmare, but he did as he was told, obediently sheathing his sword before coming to join Jack at the table.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Is it always like this?’ He picked up a single sheet of paper before tossing it away without so much as glancing at the text.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No.’ Jack swallowed the bitterness. ‘It’s usually much worse.’ He was locking the memory away, securing it in the darkest recesses of his mind, where he hid all the horror that haunted him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He was just a boy,’ Knightly said again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Then he shouldn’t have been here. He was old enough to lift a sword.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He couldn’t have hurt you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Couldn’t he?’ Jack fixed the lieutenant with a cold, soul-searching stare. ‘What would you have done had he attacked you? Spanked him and told him to go home? Or would you have hacked and flayed at the poor little bastard until he was dead.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly dropped his eyes. ‘You’re cruel.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘War is cruel.’ Jack’s voice was harsh. ‘You chose this as your career, so you’d better get used to it. Those bastards won’t hesitate to kill you if you’re foolish enough to give them the chance. So don’t give them one. Fight as hard as you can and kill them before they kill you. It’s the only way.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned away, his bitterness choking off his speech. He prided himself on being a redcoat, on being able to thrive in the brutal bloodletting of battle. He glanced across at the pathetic corpse of the boy he had killed. The joy of the victory was gone. His fine words stuck in his craw. He felt nothing but shame.</p>
