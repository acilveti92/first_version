			<p class="_-head">Excerpted passages from the personal diary of <br class="calibre2"/>Mr. Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, <br class="calibre2"/>221B Baker Street, London W1:</p>
			<p class="_-head">Saturday, April 12th, 1902.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I can conceive of no greater torment than to be subjected to both Mrs. Hudson’s recipe for pork cheese and an audience with Lord Chesley Templeton within an eight-hour period.</p>
			<p class="bt">Surely I can be brought no lower than this. And Watson’s absence only confirms the fact that April, heralded by feckless poets throughout many nations (and doubtless at least three continents), is a ghastly month and ought to be treated as such, rather than as a subject of highly unscientific verse. The bards are in this case gilding a lump rather than a lily.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend has determined against all good sense that he should attend a symposium regarding modern pulmonary treatments, and thus will return tomorrow from my own briefly attended alma mater, smelling of local ale and country air. That the man should keep abreast of the latest advancements out of professional interest is perfectly natural, and a yen to learn more about poisons and bullet trajectories and types of stab wounds I should likewise understand. But an entire forum devoted to lungs, and outside London to boot? It isn’t as if he needs to practice medicine. His wound pension is more than adequate to cover his modest gambling habit, his necessities, and the nominal sum I pretend is half the rent here. (The idea of Watson actually paying half of the exorbitant figure I dole out to prevent Mrs. Hudson from complaining about the unending stream of ruffians tramping in and out of her domicile would be absurd.)</p>
			<p class="bt">If I am alive to see his homecoming, matters will have progressed better than they have done so far today.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mrs. Hudson’s pork cheese recipe is not even particularly offensive, if I am honest with myself—molded minced meat with what I’ve deduced are savory herbs, lemon peel, and nutmeg served cold, doubtless an orthodox methodology—but I cannot be expected to eat such a thing when I consumed a perfectly respectable luncheon the day previous. Neither can I pretend to patience when a wire arrives an hour after my rejecting the slice of congealed gravy, and rather than being able to request that Watson read the message aloud that I might allow the facts to filter effortlessly into their respective slots within my brain, I must accept that the doctor is <span class="charoverride3">not present,</span> thanks to an intensive three days spent attempting to cure the <span class="charoverride3">common cough.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">The telegram read:</p>
			<p class="ext-single"><span class="charoverride3">MR. HOLMES.—I beg that you will meet with me today upon the quaint bench in Regent’s Park which lies at the charming fork in the pathway opposite the weeping elm, nearly parallel to your own lodgings STOP The matter is most urgent STOP You will know me by the rather droll antique Masonic lapel pin I shall wear STOP From three o’clock until four, I shall eagerly await you STOP</span></p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Of course this was curious, but there was nothing to be deduced from it save for the obvious facts that the gentleman was unused to intrigue, decidedly not a Freemason (they do not find their own sacred emblems “droll”), and born into the stratospheric upper classes, as he thought so little of presuming upon my time without an appointment and employing adjectives in telegrams. I rather balk at being summoned in such a peremptory manner. But I had nothing better to occupy my attention save for outlining the beginnings of a monograph upon spent bullet casings, so I silently agreed, not without a certain degree of pique.</p>
			<p class="bt">That degree was nothing compared with the ire which visited my spirits this afternoon, however.</p>
			<p class="bt">I know every inch of Regent’s Park as well as I know the rest of London—better, because Watson will insist upon my taking comradely constitutionals. So I could picture precisely the locale my would-be client had indicated. The weather was nicely temperate, and a brisk breeze whipped about my coattails. After passing a duck pond, a copse of elms, a spinster (three months in mourning for a sibling, cat fancier, works as a legal typist), and a small fountain at 3:37 p.m. (it doesn’t do to give too much leeway when a supplicant is both anonymous and presumptuous), I approached the bench in question and discovered that the identity of my client was not so much intriguing as alarming.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, Mr. Holmes, for so you must be, thank heaven you’ve come!” the delicately built man exclaimed under his breath as I sat beside him. “Dashed if I could have taken another <span class="charoverride3">instant</span> of suspense, what, but then you consulting types march to the tick of your own clocks, don’t you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Crossing my legs, I lit a cigarette to cover my annoyance. Lord Chesley Templeton was ludicrously attired in coarse tweeds which had obviously been ordered from an outrageously costly Jermyn Street tailor with specific instructions to use inferior cloth. The suit fit like a second skin and must have chafed like the devil. He did indeed sport an antique Masonic lapel pin, a five-pointed gold star with colorful enamel and the arcane emblems of the society, ringed with seed pearls and capped with a small brilliant no workingman could afford. (Whether it was droll I could not say—I could state for a certainty it failed to amuse me.) His thin mouth was quirked in a saucy smile, and he had clearly arrived long before I did, because his ears were pink from the wind. He had hidden his unmistakable high-browed and highborn features beneath a low cloth cap, rose-tinted glasses, and a beard which had been affixed with an overabundance of spirit gum, the smell of which was unmistakable. I could have told him he would have a wretched time getting the thing off without the proper solvent, but refrained.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am Mr. Jack Smith,” said he, thrusting out a lily-white hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Lord Chesley Templeton,” I replied, taking it. “While I am no stranger to noble clients, I confess I find duplicitous ones tedious.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The gentleman goggled at me. Emitting a high yip of a laugh like the barking of a terrier, he swept his cap off and scratched his pale blond curls in astonishment. “By Jove! And there’s me discovered already! Dashed if that wasn’t middling clever, Mr. Holmes—do say how you did it, eh?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was not even middling clever, I fear. I may not enjoy the society pages, but as any connoisseur of newspapers must, I do read them, and your face is printed next to every fashionable soiree from New York to Paris.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He grinned. “I suppose I am somewhat celebrated, eh?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Call it what you will.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a corker!” he crowed in that affected manner some men with twenty-four-karat accents have of employing popular slang. “Mr. Holmes, I knew you’d be perfect for this little lark I have in mind. The absolute toppingest of tops. You’ll indulge me in keeping the matter absolutely secret, won’t you, old chap, considering?”</p>
			<p class="bt">My hackles were already rising, and we had not even spent a full minute in one another’s company. “All my clients expect the same level of discretion from me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And from your doctor friend too, I trust, what’s his name, Weston? Wilson? By gad yes, we’ll want him for this. Your chum can keep his peace too, I fancy?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“John Watson.” Further nettled, I filled my lungs with smoke. “The good doctor probably knows more state secrets than most individuals in the state department.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Capital fellow!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He is.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, I’ve no doubt, not a doubt in the <span class="charoverride3">world. </span>It’s worth a small fortune to the pair of you if you’ll do as I wish.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My fees are fixed, and I do as <span class="charoverride3">I </span>wish whether a client has hired me or not. I beg of you to tell me why I am on this bench.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lord Templeton’s eyes, as blue and as empty as the April sky above, gleamed at me. “That’s the ticket—straight to business, I like that in a man. It indicates a strong spine, and we don’t want any of the flabby variety for this venture. Why, only yesterday I was saying to Sir Harry Eastmore, Harry, I says, when once you find a chap with some backbone, clasp him to your bosom, and never let go.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I made no reply to this. It seemed the best course.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You probably wonder why I am incognito?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, not especially.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come, sir, come! How could you not, a man of action like yourself, what? It would be deucedly unnatural if you didn’t. Positively perverse. Well, Mr. Holmes, I am here to invite you to a secret meeting of the Diadem Club.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My jaw tightened, I hope imperceptibly. “And what is the Diadem Club?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Absurdly pleased at the question, Lord Templeton clapped his hands in a manner my youngest Irregular would have found juvenile. “The Diadem Club is simply the <span class="charoverride3">most </span>exclusive meeting of great minds this marvelous city boasts, Mr. Holmes, curse me if I exaggerate. <span class="charoverride3">Strike</span> me down if I do, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Great minds,” I reflected, not without a hint of tragedy in my tone. “And you are a member, you say?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Fair play, Mr. Holmes, fair play!” the terrible creature chortled. “You’ve the right end of the stick. I knew you’d catch on devilish fast. <span class="charoverride3">Half </span>of the Diadem Club are members of the peerage—ministers and barons and how-d’ye-call-its, not the <span class="charoverride3">absolute</span> cream when it comes to innate talents but frightfully rich you know, and dreadfully influential, which is why we must keep our meetings buttoned up to the neck, if you follow me. <span class="charoverride3">Deathly </span>secret. Had things gone as I planned, you’d have learnt my true identity only when you attended our next meeting, but it’s dashed difficult to pull the wool over Sherlock Holmes’s eyes, eh? You’ll make a ripping addition! The jewels in our diadem are our honored invitees, all the clever and famous folk we bring into our fold—hence the Diadem Club.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You want me,” I said slowly, “to attend a society meeting specifically because I am an internationally renowned criminologist?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Got it in one! Come, come, don’t bother to thank me for thinking of you. The only Londoner more famous than Sherlock Holmes is Jack the Ripper, what?”</p>
			<p class="bt">He tittered. I am not by nature a man disposed to violence, but capability is another thing to inclination. Watson takes prudent pains not to emphasize this fact lest the many malefactors who have cause to harm us grow emboldened, and I thank him for it, for I should generally rather outwit a man than be forced to knock him down.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">And yet,</span> I mused upon the park bench, idly flexing my fingers.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes,” the fop continued eagerly, “while half the Diadem Club are composed of bluebloods, the other half are our prized guests—better than collecting thoroughbreds or hounds or any of the usual creatures, eh? We meet under cover of darkness for fear of assassins, but don’t think that stops us having a cracking good time. The founding members went in upon a private boat six years ago—perfectly innocent-looking little wreck, just sitting there, bobbing upon the waves as boats do and so forth . . . but inside! Curse me if the <span class="charoverride3">Claire Wyndham</span> doesn’t match the toniest club on earth, as they’d put the matter on Fifth Avenue. May lightning <span class="charoverride3">strike</span> me!”</p>
			<p class="bt">The thought of lightning striking Lord Templeton was not an unwelcome one.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Russian china, Chinese silk, Austrian crystal, and a French chef, by gad,” he prattled on. “I’m their newest member and so must make an impression, you see. These other bucks are always flaunting their latest painter or scientist or inventor, but if I bring them Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watkins on a silver platter? Well, that would be a <span class="charoverride3">proper</span> coup d’état, by Jove. The meeting is at midnight tomorrow. I only just hatched the notion of bringing you two hours ago and jotted off the wire posthaste. You’ll say yes, of course?”</p>
			<p class="bt">As I—seemingly ever more swiftly—approach my fiftieth year, I’ve had occasion to reflect that my manners are unlikely to undergo significant improvements at this late date. The horrid dandy was thrusting a sealed card under my nose. This I slid into my coat pocket while I pushed smoothly to my feet.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good day to you, Lord Templeton,” I said as I strode back to Baker Street, swinging my cane as I went.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Saturday, April 12th, 1902 (continued).</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I will have such revenges on Lord Templeton. I will do <span class="charoverride3">such things. </span>What they are, yet I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the earth.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">King Lear </span>never much appealed to me, my own upbringing considered, but on occasion its language is enormously satisfying.</p>
			<p class="bt">After leaving the ineptly disguised idiot in the park, I puttered about, smoked my pipe, sent dinner back fully a quarter consumed, and settled into my oldest dressing gown to review my preliminary notes regarding marks left on discharged shells. The sun sank low and the wind picked up. I shut all the windows and steeped myself in hearty shag fumes until my eyelids were abuzz and my mind was clear regarding the structure of my latest article. Greatly comforted at having passed the planning phase, I poured myself a brandy and read a recent treatise by the rising Inspector Jean-Pierre Beauchemin of the Sûreté upon similar lines. It was topical, and elegantly written, but hardly very informative. Further cheered, I refilled my glass. Mrs. Hudson knocked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There’s been a boy, Mr. Holmes,” she said with that air of long-suffering which indicates I have not been sufficiently fattening myself.</p>
			<p class="bt">Raising an eyebrow, I murmured, “Young Rowan isn’t due to deliver the Irregulars’ weekly report until Monday.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, he was not one of your lads, but he left you this note. Reply unnecessary, he said.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah. Thank you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes, is there anything particular you’d like for breakfast?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Mrs. Hudson, I should particularly like not to ruminate over the question at all.” Recalling the date, I reconsidered. “On second thought, Watson returns tomorrow—just turn breakfast into an early lunch around eleven thirty and send up those tea sandwiches he likes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, that’ll be just the thing,” she agreed, pleased. I seemed to have passed an obscure test of some kind. “Good night, then.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good night.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I stretched my slippers toward the fire I had just started and opened the envelope after a cursory examination born of habit. The address and brief letter were in an intimately familiar hand:</p>
			<p class="ext6"><span class="charoverride3">Sherlock,</span></p>
			<p class="ext1"><span class="charoverride3">Do me the favor of falling in with your latest client’s plans. Matters of some delicacy which recently arose at Whitehall require his indulgence. I have RSVP’ed on your behalf already. And do convey my regards to Sir Alderford Blythe when at the Diadem Club, whose work with me you are already familiar with.</span></p>
			<p class="ext7"><span class="charoverride3">As ever,</span></p>
			<p class="ext8"><span class="charoverride3">Mycroft</span></p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Incredible. The British government in the form of my elder brother has just charged me with the task of playing prizewinning poodle to an anemic sap who makes the lowest commoner seem a towering force of mental energy.</p>
			<p class="bt">But how, in light of king, country, and kin, can I possibly refuse?</p>
			<p class="bt">There is one sole comfort in this debacle— since Watson is returning, the timing proves felicitous, as I hadn’t any fresh case with which to occupy his thirst for action. These sudden medical urges must be nipped in the bud periodically and in the swiftest manner to hand. Thus shall I present this task to the doctor as a matter of interest and possibly even danger.</p>
			<p class="bt">Something about the case—for a case I must now call it—truly does nag at me. Revenge apparently must be foregone and given place to starched collars and silk waistcoats.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Sunday, April 13th, 1902.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">John Watson is a man greatly susceptible to expert staging. Granted, I have been known to plant important papers in curry dishes and leave duplicitous paint upon racehorses, and greatly enjoyed myself. A touch of the dramatic never fails to lend zest to any investigation. And yet . . . from time to time I find myself questioning how often I would perform such parlor tricks were my friend not so nakedly pleased by them. The answer eludes me.</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson trudged up the stairs with restrained vigor near to lunchtime, as befits a hearty man of his age still in good training. He found me occupying the bearskin rug at my full and not inconsiderable length, with a few pillows arranged to make all comfortable, in shirtsleeves and a dressing gown, sampling my black clay pipe contemplatively.</p>
			<p class="bt">This piece of theatre conveyed the impression that I was (1) possessed of an intriguing conundrum; (2) not excessively attuned to his return, at least not enough to worry him; and (3) exercising that not inconsiderable wit which he so admires and which prevents the necessity of his practicing medicine at present. Flicking my eyes over him from muddied shoe soles (which meant he had departed the campus on foot and not by trap) to sooty hat (which meant his train was not an express), I smiled briefly. The doctor looked well—revived by travel but happy to return. An answering smile tugged at his neat moustache and he set down his bag, clapping his hands to his knees as he perched on the settee next to my head.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Something is afoot, or I’m no judge,” he announced warmly.</p>
			<p class="bt">It had worked, which meant it was best to delay further gratification. Shrugging, I slit my eyes at the ceiling. “There may be something in it, and then again it may be a shocking waste of my time. But you must be fatigued after a walk to the station and the myriad agonies of the local line. The tea and sandwiches are fresh—Mrs. Hudson left them ten minutes ago.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson shook his head with a rueful grin and went to hang his hat and coat upon the rack. “I would ask how you knew my mode of travel, but odds are near certain you’ll reply with some detail involving dirt or dust.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then how do I know that they’re tearing up the tennis courts and you were disappointed you couldn’t borrow a racket and make use of them?”</p>
			<p class="bt">This time he raised his expressive eyebrows. “I haven’t the faintest.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Have you cured phthisis worldwide yet?” I asked more nastily than I had meant to.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your medical knowledge is marvelously eccentric, old man. No, afflictions of the lungs plague us still. How did you know about their improving the tennis courts?”</p>
			<p class="bt">As it happened, I knew from a combination of the quarterly university alumni newsletter and the fact he had packed his tennis shoes, but this elementary deduction did not merit public airing. En route to the dining table, Watson awaited a reply. When none was forthcoming, he adopted that strained look he cannot conceal when trying to ascertain whether I have been making too free with my constitution in his absence.</p>
			<p class="bt">As this was not a tolerable expression, I raised myself onto one elbow with a mischievous twinkle. Watson, who is as receptive to arresting movements as he is to planned panoramas, relaxed visibly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I fear I must presume upon your time this evening, Watson. Will you allow it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“With great pleasure.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Is your evening dress suitable for an outing at present?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We went to the opera a fortnight ago. I could have it aired within a few hours.” Watson shook a napkin out and placed it on his lap. “Whatever for?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Explaining to Watson about my abhorrent meeting and the still more abhorrent Diadem Club took five minutes. When this was through, I hinted that Brother Mycroft knew of strange storm clouds gathering—murky shadows which threatened the peerage, Whitehall, and possibly England. By the time I had finished, Watson had eradicated three cucumber sandwiches and two cups of tea and appeared equal parts annoyed (at our client), mystified (at his request), and intrigued (thanks to the combined persuasive powers of the Holmes brothers). His strong jaw tilted in contemplation as he passed his napkin over his mouth.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What a distasteful prospect,” he commented.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, it’s ghastly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should prefer running down a killer in some low den of iniquity, in all seriousness.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The feeling is mutual.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That you should be treated like a trophy in such a manner . . . I don’t know how to stomach it, frankly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s your own fault, spreading me so liberally across the pages of <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand </span>like some swaggering penny dreadful hero,” I accused him, following the script of an argument almost as old as our friendship. “I loathe the notion, but ought I defy the Crown?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course not, forgive me. Our duty is clear.” Drumming his fingers on the tablecloth, my friend sat back, emitting a weary breath tinged with anticipation. “I’ll have my tails brushed. And my revolver cleaned,” he added, winking.</p>
			<p class="bt">Whensoever I think that my colleague is a volume long since memorized, I turn another page and he surprises me. In this instance, it was the candor and patriotism with which he replied to a remark about our monarch I had made with utter flippancy. At the best of times, I can be glib, and at the worst, unforgivably callous—to be taken seriously when I had not meant the sentiment at all was highly uncomfortable. I was abashed enough to redirect my attention to the mantel clock, for occasionally the doctor’s sincerity is slightly overwhelming to a man of my reticence.</p>
			<p class="bt">After all, despite my legendary prickliness, I am flesh and blood in addition to smoke and mirrors.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You left yourself out, my dear fellow,” I mentioned carelessly a few seconds later. “I’ve no wish to see you paraded like a circus tiger either.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your brother wouldn’t have written if it wasn’t important.”</p>
			<p class="bt">This recalled to my mind the unease I felt about something to do with Lord Templeton’s account, something I could not put my finger upon which itched at the back of my brain. Having given the case so little thought save for detesting the prospect, I wondered what it was I had missed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Don’t wind yourself up too tightly, Watson. If this matter involves nothing save wild geese . . .” I warned him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then we’ll have been paid richly to eat a lavish dinner. Where’s the harm in that? I’ll combine my funds with yours and you can send another set of your Irregulars away to school, the way you did with the Duke of Holdernesse’s reward money last year.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My mouth dropped open, I confess. “You . . . I never . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, you did. Don’t lie to me, it’s in poor form, my dear Holmes. I saw young Jenkins in the street the other day, who heard from Poole, who had it out of Jemmy, who spilled all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">This was most vexing. “Well, I must have a stern word with Jemmy, in that case, upon the subject of privacy<span class="charoverride3">.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson had the gall to laugh in my face. “Oh, come, I knew you were scheming to do <span class="charoverride3">something </span>with the duke’s six thousand pounds. Aside from your taste in wine, and your meticulousness with your tailor, you’re the most frugal bachelor in existence, and how many times have I heard you repeat that your fees are fixed—save, of course, when you remit them? Anyway, do you suppose I don’t notice when Irregulars vanish, are replaced, and one day reappear in the metropolis as clerks and solicitors? If I didn’t already know you fail to consider me a complete imbecile, I should be insulted.”</p>
			<p class="bt">By this time, I was blushing furiously, a symptom of strong feeling long abhorred but uncontrollable nevertheless for a man of my waxen complexion. “Of course I don’t, but—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Honestly, Holmes, what did you imagine I would conclude?” My friend’s eyes sparkled. He was enjoying himself immensely. “That you suddenly bought a landed estate in Kent? That the price of shag tobacco had increased astronomically? Get up—I poured you tea and it’s rapidly expiring.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Shutting my mouth, I obeyed, which was both more pleasant and simple than arguing. Watson is no genius, but I can personally attest that he owns a remarkable capacity for managing one. And half an hour ago, I found the emerald tiepin given me by our previous gracious sovereign, which I plan to wear this evening, and spent a wistful few minutes studying it.</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson was a courageous soldier and remains one at heart, so why should it have surprised me that Mycroft’s urges combined with my machinations moved him to undertake a repellent task so gracefully? I stopped to set this small domestic interlude down almost without knowing why, but I think I have it now.</p>
			<p class="bt">Someday, God forbid it should ever prove necessary, I would like to think myself as ready to be of service to England as John Watson is to both the nation and its sole consulting detective. I would also like to think that he knows as much.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Monday, April 14th, 1902.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">This diary belongs to the biggest fool ever to draw breath upon this island. Watson would not say so, in fact praised my quick thinking, but he may as well have complimented a prize cock for making an infernal racket. That would be very like him.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we had donned white gloves and tall hats and called down for a hansom, and while Watson was making an adjustment to his cravat in the mirror above the sideboard, I finally opened the card Lord Chesley Templeton had given me with instructions as to the whereabouts of the <span class="charoverride3">Claire Wyndham,</span> and suffered a profound shock.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What the devil!” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes?” Watson was peering over my shoulder seconds later.</p>
			<p class="bt">The card was of the finest stock, deeply letterpressed with excellent ink, and read:</p>
			<p class="ext"><span class="charoverride3">Mr. Sherlock Holmes &amp; Dr. John Watson:</span></p>
			<p class="ext9"><span class="charoverride3">Please be at Cleopatra’s Needle at 11:45.</span></p>
			<p class="ext10"><span class="charoverride3">The Diadem Club is honored to welcome you.</span></p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">“Something about this alarms you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Extremely.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lord Chesley Templeton had been wearing a ludicrous suit impeccably tailored to fit him.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">We meet under cover of darkness for fear of assassins, but don’t think that stops us having a cracking good time,</span> he had said.</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">I only just hatched the notion of bringing you two hours ago and jotted off the wire posthaste,</span> he had also said.</p>
			<p class="bt">Then, following my abrupt departure, the note from my brother. I cursed under my breath.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, Watson, Watson! I nearly made a farcical blunder, and we have been saved from my own stupidity only at the last moment. What a blind beetle I have been! Your revolver is loaded, I trust?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It should be of little use if it weren’t.” The doctor’s eyes were wide. “May I ask what precisely we’ll be doing this evening apart from attending a grotesquely snobbish dinner party?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Preventing a murder,” I answered with unrestrained glee.</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson’s expression as I turned on my heel and trotted down the stairs following this pronouncement was worth every second I had spent in Lord Templeton’s company.</p>
			<p class="bt">The journey was uneventful and I kept my peace throughout. Both Watson and I benefit from these interludes—they stimulate his imagination and allow me time to focus my thoughts. We paid the cabbie and alighted to the street, walking unhurriedly to the Victoria Embankment. The night was quiet save for the occasional stroller, stately rows of trees along the gaslit walkway rustled in the cool breeze, lights danced over the Thames, there was bloodshed to be thwarted, and I reflected that I might be forced to reconsider my uncharitable opinion of April.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we reached the looming and—under the circumstances—ominous-seeming Cleopatra’s Needle, we found Lord Chesley Templeton leaning against its base like the most worthless titled rake in Christendom. He had suffered no injury from the spirit gum but was instead smooth-cheeked and debonair with his tousled pale curls jostling each other beneath his top hat, as I had anticipated. I bit down upon a smile and affected an air of supercilious irritation, which I admit comes naturally to me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, but here’s the famous pair!” Lord Templeton cried. “Curse me if I’m not the prince of the Diadem Club after tonight. <span class="charoverride3">Strike </span>me down if I am mistaken! Mr. Holmes, a pleasure to see you again. Dr. Watford, delighted to make your acquaintance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson raised his eyebrows but, consummate gentleman that he is, he made no other sign as we all shook hands. I could not blame the doctor for his skeptical expression: the aristocrat wore a waistcoat of crimson velvet beneath a suit so expensive its price could have purchased a small country.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This way!” He waved us along with a flourish, going so far as to execute a small jig as he set forth. “We’ve a private dock, of course, and the <span class="charoverride3">Claire Wyndham</span> will arrive shortly. What a jolly night it is, to be sure!”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend knew better than to question me, but he did dart me a glance of such profound irony that I could not resist smirking in return.</p>
			<p class="bt">At this point, were Watson writing the narrative, he would wax on endlessly about the quality of the fog tendrils beginning to creep along the turgid waters and the humble appearance of both the dilapidated private dock and the <span class="charoverride3">Claire Wyndham,</span> with shabby black curtains drawn over its windows, bilge and barnacles crusting its hull, and chipped red paint flaking from its paddle box. And once we had been led inside the decrepit vessel, he would rapturously describe the sumptuous chandeliers, the champagne flowing into silver chalices, and the arch chatter of some two dozen aristocrats and their pet prodigies, all gushing effusions at each other as we progressed along the Thames.</p>
			<p class="bt">I shall retain silence on the subject save for the fact it was every bit as beastly as we had both anticipated.</p>
			<p class="bt">We were introduced to all and sundry; grotesque levels of enthusiasm were expressed at our presence; and I was seated adjacent to Lord Templeton for dinner, Watson next to a baroness with a wide, pleasant face and plentiful ropes of pearls (fiction writer, Hungarian origins, obviously from a musical family). Turning to my left after the soup had been cleared, I shook hands with Sir Alderford Blythe. A short man with a waxed moustache and thin black brows, he brought to mind a rather skittish beetle. His shoulders were stiff with tension, but his eyes remained determinedly neutral, and he had touched neither food nor drink.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your work with Brother Mycroft has been greatly appreciated by many parties,” said I softly. “How go the negotiations?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Better than we could initially have hoped, Mr. Holmes,” he returned under his breath. “If we are successful, a Japanese alliance may yet be procured, and would have the profoundest consequences upon our international relations.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So I have been told.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your brother is a brilliantly farsighted individual.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear gentlemen, take a turn upon the deck with me before the fish course?” Lord Templeton piped merrily to Watson and myself, gripping our shoulders. “I’m positively dying for a smoke. I shall simply <span class="charoverride3">expire.</span> You must accompany me lest I succumb to <span class="charoverride3">boredom,</span> which is the very last affliction which should plague us on this of all nights.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Pressing Sir Alderford’s forearm reassuringly, I rose and the three of us exited. Secluded in the shadow of a smokestack, Lord Templeton passed us slender French cigarettes and said in an incisive tenor, “Thank you for coming, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. Your brother explained the mission, I trust?”</p>
			<p class="bt">All pretense of dandyism had dissolved like so much steam. Watson’s square chin dropped before he abruptly closed his lips again, bless the fellow.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your suit and the card had already shown your hand rather neatly,” I demurred. “You deliberately told me you had only just thought of inviting me to the Diadem Club two hours previous, yet somehow you managed to procure a fully tailored Jermyn Street suit for that admirably preposterous disguise and a letterpressed invitation with our names at the top. I was meant to take notice, and Mycroft’s hint clinched the matter. Post me up, if you please. There will be an attempt on Sir Alderford’s life tonight?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You don’t disappoint, Mr. Holmes.” Lord Templeton nodded gravely. “Indeed so. I was lucky to have secured a place in the club, and had your brother not intervened . . .” He shook his fair head. “One of the invitees, masquerading as a pioneering physicist, is in fact the spy Louis La Rothiere.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of Notting Hill? You mean the tall fellow with the pomaded hair and the brocade waistcoat?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why, yes, I do. You have encountered him before, I take it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Never, but the chap who was introduced as a Sussex-born polymath remarked upon the vintage <span class="charoverride3">Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin</span> they were so liberally serving as only a native Frenchman could ever accomplish. Accents and their origins are a hobby of mine. I’ve had my eye on him all evening.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lord Templeton smiled, though he remained grave. “For obvious reasons, I cannot myself intervene—all my value to England relies upon my maintaining this persona. The stalwart duo of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, however? No one will so much as blink. The accent in remarking on the champagne—brilliant! Our cover could not be more perfect. The quarry is in our sights, and the trophy entirely yours, gentlemen. Whitehall thanks you for your service.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Just then, a rustling which was not the susurration of waves met my keen ears, and I stepped out of the shadows. Watson’s dining companion the baroness stood there, likewise smoking, wearing a look of great attentiveness.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And <span class="charoverride3">that’s</span> the stunner, Mr. Holmes, the knockout punch!” Lord Templeton exclaimed, instantly a pretentious peacock once more. “Oh, Baroness, what luck you’re there! Did you hear my proposal about the play I mean to write about Mr. Holmes and Dr. Whitson here? I shall play the role of the canny spy late of the Boer Wars, India, the Irish conflict, and the Chinese court. It’ll be a smash hit, nothing less, eh? I’d stake a thousand pounds it will. I’d put my <span class="charoverride3">life</span> on the line, to be sure. Well, we had all better get back to the fish, what?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Few words are required to detail what remains. As midnight neared, I identified a concealed knife about La Rothiere’s person. In the ensuing struggle, which was <span class="charoverride3">most </span>invigorating, I suffered a slice to the palm, the punch bowl and its entire contents were sacrificed to the cause of justice, and Watson’s revolver finally settled the matter. My explanations were met with actual applause, which was gauche but hardly avoidable. Watson clucked over my injury but finally allowed that his handkerchief would do to stanch the wound until after we disembarked. (While both of us relish danger, we each tend to rather abhor the sight of the other actively bleeding, a paradox I do not wish to have cause to marvel over ever again.) When we docked once more near to Cleopatra’s Needle, a trio of Yard detectives awaited us, and La Rothiere was carted away.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Simply smashing to meet you, Mr. Holmes!” Lord Templeton rejoiced, clapping his hands and then clasping them adoringly under his chin like a music hall ingenue. “And Dr. Waldron. A <span class="charoverride3">joy.</span> Best to your brother, Mr. Holmes, and tell the <span class="charoverride3">Strand </span>illustrator to stop putting you in that tragic hat. It’s an affront, I tell you, a travesty of justice. You look <span class="charoverride3">much</span> better in city togs, curse me if I lie. <span class="charoverride3">Strike</span> me down if that isn’t my heartfelt opinion. Farewell!”</p>
			<p class="bt">We bade him good night, Watson with an air of amazement and I struggling not to laugh until another, better thought sobered me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I would do the same, if I were asked,” said I, my gaze on Lord Chesley Templeton’s slim back as he flounced away.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Beg pardon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson inspires a dreadful habit in me of blurting out whatever thought comes into my head, supposing I urgently want him to know its contents, and these slips require me to tell stories backward, which is nigh-impossible to accomplish in any elegant fashion. I blame the doctor for this failing unequivocally. His florid syntax has infected my much more methodical approach to language.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mentally cuffing myself, I explained, “Lord Chesley Templeton is a consummate performer—he lives and breathes the role whilst recording every scrap of data, making deductions, planning his next moves. I would not be inexpert at this task. In fact, I daresay it would fall directly under my purview as a specialist, and if called upon by the Crown to perform such a duty, for years if necessary, I should instantly agree. I don’t know that I’d excel at marching through deserts or returning enemy fire or ordering men to their deaths, but at <span class="charoverride3">that </span>. . .” I nodded at the disappearing silhouette. “At that I could succeed. And I would say yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes,” Watson huffed, frowning in the solicitous way he has, “do you suppose I don’t already know that?”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I made no answer, for I could think of none suitable, he chuckled fondly. “Let us presume you shan’t be required to, all right? It would mean the country was headed for certain disaster. Your theoretical talents as a spy will keep, for the rest of our lives I hope. Right, I’m finding us a cab. I expected to be done in following a night at the Diadem Club, but admittedly not in this fashion, and I’ve yet to patch you up again.”</p>
			<p class="_-head">Sunday, April 20th, 1902.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">“What’s the matter, Watson?” I asked without turning my head after the second post this morning. He was not in my line of sight where I sat at my worktable organizing academic references upon bullet casings (scant though they were), but my chemistry apparatus was, and I always keep my flasks polished to a high sheen.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s terribly disconcerting when you do that, you know.” The doctor’s voice was even, but still his knit brows betrayed perplexity at the letter in his hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">“When I do what?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Deduce me without looking at me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s efficient, my dear fellow. Anything amiss?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not precisely.” Watson tossed the paper to his desktop before him. “I’ve had a letter from the baroness at the Diadem Club that night—apparently she’s a writer. She asked whether I would mind her appropriating the details of our adventure aboard the <span class="charoverride3">Claire Wyndham.</span> Admittedly you played a minor enough role, and I can’t reveal the smallest hint of Lord Templeton’s involvement, so since I won’t use it myself, I am bound to say yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I swiveled, appalled. “If another spinner of fanciful tales even dreams of—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Pray calm yourself. No, I’m your biographer, and I’ll tell her as much.” Watson smiled in a lopsided manner, tapping the desk with his pen. “I can’t think what she’ll make of it without either mentioning you or betraying Whitehall. Of course, I’ll advise her on the subject.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What is her name?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Baroness Emmunska Orczy.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve never heard of her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, neither have I. But I can’t see the harm so long as I give her fair warning as to the difficulties.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson set to penning a return correspondence at once. A curious addendum to a curious case, I thought it. Happily, however, a new scientific treatise upon the art of detection will shortly make its way into the world, the quality of which I hope will balance out the endless stream of sentimentality flowing from the pens of loosely factual biographers and adventure authors alike.</p>
