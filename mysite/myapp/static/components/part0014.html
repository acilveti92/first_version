			<p class="_-head">Excerpted passages from the personal diary of<br class="calibre2"/>Mr. Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, <br class="calibre2"/>221B Baker Street, London W1:</p>
			<p class="_-head">Saturday, September 29th, 1888.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I have just seen Watson, Sir Henry Baskerville, and Dr. Mortimer off at Charing Cross train station.</p>
			<p class="bt">A knifelike autumn wind sliced along the platform as their carriage pulled away. It no doubt accounted for the chill I felt, as I am hardly given to fanciful imaginings—although I confess myself not entirely easy in my mind regarding this case. When Watson and I followed the mysterious bearded gentleman so shamelessly pursuing Sir Henry Baskerville, I could have continued to look at myself in the shaving mirror of a morning had I learnt anything useful. Instead, I had my own name thrown back in my face, as it were, and could do nothing more useful than to consider it a lesson in humility along the lines of “Norbury.” (Watson, despite being under standing orders to whisper this word when I am suffering an attack of hubris, is too polite to carry out the assignment and shirks dreadfully when I am making an ass of myself. I intend to take him to task on this subject when I see him again.)</p>
			<p class="bt">I now fear very much for Sir Henry and the enormous fortune he stands to inherit—vast wealth has a tendency to make bodily threats all the more material. Dr. Mortimer is right to fret over his friend Sir Charles Baskerville’s heir. These men, whoever they are, mean business.</p>
			<p class="bt">Thus shall I speed to Baskerville Hall as soon as is possible, though my instincts tell me not to reveal myself as a key player in this drama prematurely. My appearance would only serve to put the guilty party on guard. (This is largely Watson’s fault—I’ll admit that having an international reputation is good for business, but it is terrible for stealth.) Perhaps a hidden lair would be preferable? Meanwhile, the good Watson has been instructed to take every care, and doubtless he will apply himself posthaste to providing me with grist for the mill via letter. I wish I had one in hand already, but I suppose it is unreasonable to expect him to write to me when he is still on a train.</p>
			<p class="bt">Strictly speaking, I was guilty of a small prevarication with my friend; I am indeed investigating a case of blackmail for one of the highest families in the land whilst remaining behind, but I did not tell him that the victim is a woman. It really wouldn’t have done to give Watson the impression I was charging to the rescue of another damsel in distress, not three months after that exceedingly volatile Milverton business. He was <span class="charoverride3">adamant</span> over seeing that case through with me, and ever since he fusses terribly when I take on cases of blackmail—as if I wander the intricate suburbs and byways of our great metropolis on the lookout for opportunities to become falsely engaged to housemaids and to burgle safes. Ridiculous. One engagement was quite enough for a lifetime, or so I dearly hope.</p>
			<p class="bt">The doctor knows one thing: I <span class="charoverride3">loathe</span> blackmailers.</p>
			<p class="bt">What comparison can be made between an impetuous act of violence and the deliberate ruination of a human life for no reason save personal profit—the slow siphoning of money, joy, and security all in a single foul act? There is no honor in the deed—as honor can be found even in murder—no more mercy in its perpetrators than milk in a male tiger, as the Bard puts it. Despicable. I compared the late unlamented Milverton to a serpent, and I meant it with a passion. Snakes (as I have been careful to mention to no one) turn my stomach over, but not more so than do blackmailers.</p>
			<p class="bt">Young Lady Violet Gaskell (daughter of the late Marquess of Cleveland) is a tendril of a most distinguished family tree. Ordinarily this would make no difference to me, but obviously the exalted have much more to fear from blackmailers than the plebeians. Her card revealed little. I will paste it here and continue the account after I’ve spoken with her anon.</p>
			<p class="ext"><span class="charoverride3">Dear Mr. Holmes,</span></p>
			<p class="ext1"><span class="charoverride3">I am being threatened by the most vile scoundrel—I can say no more without incriminating myself, save to confess that it is a case of blackmail. You are my sole chance at redemption. Please agree to meet me at Chessington House, Surrey, at four in the afternoon on Saturday next, and I will make all clear. I beg of you, do not fail me.</span></p>
			<p class="ext2"><span class="charoverride3">In hope,</span></p>
			<p class="ext2"><span class="charoverride3">Violet Gaskell</span></p>
			<p class="_-head">Saturday, September 29th, 1888 (continued).</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">What a terrifically unpleasant afternoon.</p>
			<p class="bt">There is something amiss about this Gaskell matter I cannot quite put my finger on. It is tapping at the back of my mind, but for the life of me I can’t identify what it is. Having learned long ago to trust such instincts and wait to see what they reveal, I shall simply bide my time despite my native impatience. Meanwhile, my thoughts have been pulled on more than one occasion back to the Baskerville business. Watson must surely be at the hall by now, and whatever my sentiments on the subject of spectral canines from Hell (manifestly absurd), the physical footprints of an enormous hound are quite another thing (potentially perilous).</p>
			<p class="bt">My brief journey to Surrey was an uneventful one. The weather was fine, and the foliage a veritable palette of fiery hues. Chessington House proved the sort of sprawling architectural study in opulence that tends to send Watson’s accounts of my cases careening away from the pristine study of dispassionate logic to flounder in descriptions of trailing ivy and mullioned windows. He’d have loved the ramshackle pile of stones nestled within its blanket of red-orange leaves<span class="charoverride3">.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">Chessington House was every bit as drenched in wealth on the inside as it was outside, as I discovered when the butler (name: Giles, originally from Newcastle, unmarried, asthmatic, parents obviously manufactory workers) showed me through to the parlor. I could have taken a world tour for the price of one of their fire irons, so I will say this for our blackmailer: he is after a considerable sum.</p>
			<p class="bt">I waited four and a half minutes for Lady Violet, and when she did arrive, she slipped through an interior door from an adjacent darkened room rather than use the hall entrance. At once, I knew her to be truly distraught, for I detected a faint aroma of headache powder, and her delicate face was quite pale. Watson, had he been present and inclined to record the matter, would have altered this fact to allow her to enter from a backlit doorway, “tender lamplight spilling softly around the crescentic parabola of her womanly figure, as she stood with one hand resting against the sinuous folds of her violet day-dress, the sweet ellipse of her mouth parted in dismay,” or some such drivel. I will <span class="charoverride3">never</span> comprehend the man’s obsession with silhouetted females. It is a source of peculiar bemusement to me. Time after time (eight times) he has written of women shaped like women (surely unsurprising) and lit them from behind (unnecessarily) with angelic nimbi, despite the fact that each time the lady in question was already seated when we arrived.</p>
			<p class="bt">Some mysteries even I cannot solve.</p>
			<p class="bt">But I digress. Lady Violet was twenty years of age, small of stature, a very dark brunette with blue eyes and the pale ivory skin of our pedigreed aristocracy, with the requisite stark cheekbones, and every bit as difficult to read as women generally are. Showing little in the way of strain, she pressed my hand most determinedly. She gave the impression of a strong, confident being who has been subjected to an unexpected extremity. I liked her from the first. The sole callus I was able to feel revealed nothing to me, as it was perched upon the extremity of her middle finger, and I already knew her favored womanly accomplishment to be the oil study. One does not simply walk into the richest family manse in Surrey without conducting due research—Lady Violet is a much-lauded talent in her rarefied artistic circles.</p>
			<p class="bt">“How good of you to come, Mr. Holmes,” she said lowly. “This business—you must pardon me for having been so terse in my letter, and so rudely insistent as well, but it comes as a cruel blow. Pray sit down.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your letter was to the point, Lady Violet, which I appreciated not in spite of its brevity but because of it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">We took seats on either side of a rich brocade settee. “I hardly knew what to write to you, I was so frightened,” she admitted.</p>
			<p class="bt">This confirmed my belief Lady Violet Gaskell owned considerable strength of character, for the penmanship upon the missive had been perfectly legible despite her apprehension. Nevertheless, I assumed what I have found to be a calming tone as I answered, “Scarcely any species of reptile incites greater disgust in me than the professional blackmailer, I assure you. Please tell me everything—and though doubtless it must pain you to speak of it, knowing the nature of the incident over which you are being threatened may prove helpful.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is the old story, Mr. Holmes. I fear that we must discuss a regrettable <span class="charoverride3">affaire de coeur,</span> one which has led to a ghastly attempt to extort a small fortune.” She pulled a sachet of lavender from a pocket within her magenta day-dress, smelling it gingerly. “Do excuse me. . . . I suffer from migraines on occasion and seem to be fending off an attack. The strain has been overwhelming.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, we shall see what we can do to lessen it. When were you first approached?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Three days ago, Mr. Holmes. For the first two days, I hid my problem from everyone, but finally I was forced to confide in my aunt, the Dowager Lady Edith Cranley, my late father’s sister. The shame of it was almost unbearable, but I had no choice in the matter.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I take it you were in some fiscal difficulties?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just so. You see, I’ve only very limited access to my own money, and she administers my trust. My allowance would not nearly have covered the sum he mentioned.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sighing, she settled back against the cushions. “This could not have come at a more damaging time. I am engaged to be married, Mr. Holmes—to Sir Wellesley Lyttleton, in a fortnight. All the preparations are already in place. Of course, the blackguard must be counting upon this fact to ensure my silence.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That is very plausible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As I’m admittedly a trifle unwell, I shall attempt to be concise, Mr. Holmes. Three days ago, then, I had a typewritten note requesting that I travel into the city and take a turn on foot through Hyde Park at one in the afternoon. You can scarcely comprehend the fear that such a vague yet threatening correspondence triggers.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps not, but I have a peculiarly lucid imagination. May I see it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It horrified me so, I burned it straightaway. I apologize—could a mere typewritten note have assisted you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Smaller trifles than a note have done so in the past. If you receive anything further, please retain it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course. I am entirely in your hands, Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What did the message say? Word for word, if you can recall.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do forgive me, but I cannot quote it exactly. I was to be alone when I entered the park, to tell no one I was coming, and should I comply, I would avoid a great scandal. My heart turned to granite in my chest when I saw the closing line—it said simply, ‘A friend of Robert Winter.’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The gentleman who courted you in the past, I take it, and to whom you perhaps addressed correspondences of an amiable nature?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’re as clever as they say, Mr. Holmes.” She smiled, dimpling, which was the merest datum for me but an unfortunate loss to the absent Watson. “Yes, four years ago during the season I met him at an officers’ ball. Lieutenant Robert Winter was a recruit in the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Fifth Regiment, and I but a girl of sixteen. His career was rising, and he cut a truly dashing figure of a man—blond and broad-shouldered, with an easy grace about him. I was guilty of nothing more than fanciful letters, Mr. Holmes, just as you inferred, but even the hint of shame would be enough to put Wellesley off the match. He is most . . . fastidious in all his affairs.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You mentioned—and forgive my candor—you’ve your own fortune but limited access to the same?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Noticing unconscious gestures is of the utmost value to the investigator, and when Lady Violet brushed her fingers across her skirts irritably, I could see she was patently vexed by this topic. (As indeed should I have been if I were not allowed access to my own money.)</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am not genteelly poor, Mr. Holmes, merely the victim of an unfortunately worded bequest,” she elaborated. “Until such day as I am married, or twenty-five years old—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Supposing you were to manage to reach twenty-five years of age without attracting a suitor, we would face disgrace—but then, you never were a great follower of social norms,” a voice like turned green apples groused. “This is the . . . the <span class="charoverride3">hired detective,</span> I take it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">When people refer to me as a detective rather than an independent consulting detective, they are being unspecific but technically accurate. When they refer to me as a “hired detective,” on the other hand, they are being deliberately insulting.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, Aunt Edith,” Lady Violet answered, coloring. “You mustn’t be so—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, what <span class="charoverride3">must</span> I do or what <span class="charoverride3">mustn’t </span>I do this time?” the old woman snapped. She shuffled slowly to a pillowed armchair and settled into it as if a steel rod had been inserted through the crown of her head at birth.</p>
			<p class="bt">The Dowager Viscountess Edith Cranley was not ugly; she was a distinguished elderly woman with her niece’s porcelain complexion but with someone else’s pugnacious jaw, and hair white as cigar ash. There was malice in her boot polish and rudeness to her personal maid in the pressed black lace of her sleeve cuffs. She was the sort of relic of the Empire who doubtless supposed that keeping hounds was a necessary tenet of respectable living, that the Irish starved en masse forty years ago owing to lack of foresight, and that illness indicates a want of moral willpower. The instant I encountered her, my aversion was established.</p>
			<p class="bt">I am no revolutionary, but unchecked snobbery offends my sense of balance.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The girl must marry, that’s all there is to it,” the crone announced. “Mr. Holmes, if that is who you are, there is no other outcome possible. You must ensure that this blackmailer is stopped, or else—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Or else what, Aunt?” Lady Violet asked, eyes wide.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Or else I shall simply pay the wretch, and have done!” Lady Cranley cried, fluttering her fingers as if paying a blackmailer on a single occasion would forever solve her niece’s problem. Knowing this belief untrue, I cleared my throat, annoyed. “The bequest Lady Violet mentioned . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“She gets two hundred a month when she marries or turns twenty-five.” Lady Cranley’s tone clearly implied, <span class="charoverride3">when she marries or is sentenced to hang at Tyburn.</span> “But she’ll never hold up the family name if this foul scheme carries through, and she is already ­twenty-two—past time to be happily tied to a suitable spouse and having children of her own.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I quite understand the situation,” I said coolly. “Lady Violet, regarding the incident in Hyde Park—what transpired, exactly?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I was accosted by a stranger,” she replied, voice strained. “As instructed, I was walking along, quite alone, when suddenly a fine trap approached. The man inside demanded I get in, and I didn’t know how to refuse. I stepped up into the darkened carriage with my heart in my mouth. My persecutor smiled at me and quoted the very words I had written to this handsome engineer—harmless words, Mr. Holmes, but ones that Wellesley would find altogether scandalous. When I pleaded with the cad to return my letters, he said he wanted ten thousand pounds to remain silent.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should hardly call the loss of ten thousand pounds <span class="charoverride3">harmless,</span>” Lady Cranley sniffed.</p>
			<p class="bt">I leaned forward, tenting my fingertips. “I hope it will not come to that. Describe the man.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But I cannot<span class="charoverride3">,</span>” Lady Violet said bitterly. “Would that I were capable, but the carriage was dark and the man masked. Nothing stood out. I could barely distinguish a sleeve button in that gloom, let alone the color of an eye. . . . I am sincerely sorry, Mr. Holmes. My greatest fear is that there is nothing whatsoever you can do.” And with that, she commenced weeping.</p>
			<p class="bt">I have stared death itself in the face multiple times. But the only organisms which alarm me more than snakes and blackmailers are copiously weeping women—in part because I wish they were not in such distress, and in part because it is difficult to guess how best to stem the flow and return to the hard facts that will enable me to assist them tangibly. Thankfully my ability to soothe those who feel hope is lost is not inconsiderable, and I hastened to comfort her spirits.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Lady Violet, despite your inability to identify your tormentor, I am ready and willing to act as your agent, and I do not exaggerate when I say that no one could possibly serve your interests better. I fear, however, that another case necessitates my leaving London as soon as possible. How were you told to communicate with the villain? If I can attempt to trace him, I may be able to put a stop to this without delay.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, do,” Lady Cranley huffed. “It has taken me years to arrange a suitable match for my niece, and I will not watch an excellent marital opportunity dissolve at my feet.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lady Violet pressed an embroidered kerchief into her still streaming eyes. “He said he would give me time to gather the funds. He is to write to me again tomorrow afternoon with instructions, which is the reason I so urgently wanted to see you today.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I pressed her arm. “Tomorrow afternoon, then, you must deliver the note to me and meticulously follow any instructions I might dictate.” Passing her my card, I rose.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I shall be at Baker Street on the instant I hear news,” she assured me, also standing.</p>
			<p class="bt">Just then the hall door banged open and a visibly fuming figure stepped over the threshold. A man of sixty years, with great bristling side-whiskers (gout sufferer, exceedingly wealthy, spent time in South Africa, political conservative, breeder of spaniels), entered with a gnarled walking stick in his hand, waving its head vaguely at the ceiling. Lady Violet shrank back while Lady Cranley smiled in an abrupt show of greeting.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have been sitting in the courtyard for nearly ten minutes!” the old man snapped. “Were we or were we not meant to take a drive this afternoon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But you sent no one to fetch—I was just coming, Wellesley,” Lady Violet stammered.</p>
			<p class="bt">My heart sank. Never were truer words written than that when sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And who’s this, then?” he growled, pointing at me. “Some sort of tradesman? What’s he to do with? The wedding, no doubt?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes,” Lady Violet said in a choked voice. “He’s the florist. Mr. Holmes, allow me to introduce my fiancé, Sir Wellesley Lyttleton.”</p>
			<p class="_-head">Saturday, September 29th, 1888 (continued).</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I don’t like this. I don’t like it <span class="charoverride3">at all.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">Little did Watson know it, but I had taken him to see Lady Violet’s work at a Bond Street picture gallery upon the day Sir Henry Baskerville lost his second boot. The establishment was showing one of her portraits, an ethereal study of her friend the Lady Rosamund Grimsham. I made a pretense of examining some very fine Belgian landscapes, but it was Lady Violet’s work I’d particularly wished to examine, knowing that I would soon be acting upon her behalf.</p>
			<p class="bt">I suggested to Watson—and he most sturdily disagreed, the stout fellow, telling me that my ideas were crude at best—that art allows the close reasoner to deduce more about the painter than the subject. (I kept to myself the fact that the painting before us led me to gather Lady Violet was a highly perceptive, resolute woman.) It is confounding to me that Watson failed to take my point; when I play my own compositions on the violin, they sound like nothing imitative of the exterior world, but rather the inside of my mind. They are imaginary landscapes, as darkly fanciful as my musings, and serve when I am in the dumps to lessen despair by virtue of expressing it.</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson is simply wrong—but then there is no art in his blood whatsoever. He has seen much evil in his life, but tragedy and hardship have quite failed to taint his mind with morose imaginings, for his nerves have now thoroughly recovered from the Battle of Maiwand. My friend is the best of men, a relentless optimist, and unfortunately he wouldn’t know a Rembrandt from a harpsichord.</p>
			<p class="bt">Why would a sensitive, comely young woman marry such a sullen old stick, meanwhile?</p>
			<p class="bt">I am meant to defend this match from the ravages of blackmail and find myself longing for Lady Violet’s exposure. As a florist—clever girl—I spent a mere three minutes in the company of Sir Wellesley Lyttleton and by the end of the interlude had pegged him for a slow-witted, petulant bully. A rich, slow-witted, petulant bully, I grant; but if one were to compile every separate fortune amassed by the East India Company, the wealth would be an insufficient recompense for marrying such a brute. Not when divorce is so nearly impossible. I would as soon permanently tether myself to a wardrobe as a female, but that doesn’t mean I am unsympathetic to the plight of women who suffer cruelties for marriages of financial convenience.</p>
			<p class="bt">And as I mentioned already, something disturbs me, something I still cannot yet quite identify. There is a crack in the lens I can barely make out. Infuriating. Lady Violet is my client and I must protect her interests—evidently, however, her interests lie in quite another direction from her request.</p>
			<p class="bt">I wish the doctor were here. His advice would be invaluable—­gallantry, thy name is Dr. John H. Watson. For all he was too thin and far too rootless and melancholy, he may as well have stepped down off a white charger that day at St. Bart’s years ago. I had a telegram from him upon returning to Baker Street stating they’d arrived safely in Devonshire and were comfortably ensconced at the hall. While searching for the monograph on the contusions caused by garroting that I lent to him, I found that he had neglected to pack his woolen muffler, despite the fact it is nearly October. Is this the act of a prudent medical practitioner? Honestly, he can be very trying at times.</p>
			<p class="bt">I gave it to Mrs. Hudson to send by the first post on the morrow. She keeps niggling me to eat, and packaging the scarf served to distract her, if only for twenty minutes.</p>
			<p class="bt">So I have concluded my first day of investigations into the Gaskell case with distressingly little to show for it save the deepest concerns regarding Lady Violet’s engagement. Pray God that tomorrow provides me with better opportunities to do my job, and to do it well.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Sunday, September 30th, 1888.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Three hours of restless slumber, inexplicably haunted by hounds with slavering jaws and hellfire burning in their pupils. My eyes are dry as newsprint and my neck stiff as a telegraph post. I never sleep much when working, but these night visions are equally as confounding as they are disturbing. It isn’t as if I am worried about the doctor—he survived Afghanistan; he can face mythological dogs. Should Watson prove diligent in his efforts regarding the Baskerville affair (and diligence is one of his most pronounced characteristics, as mine is acumen), I shall reward him with picture postcards of backlit women.</p>
			<p class="bt">I need to get to Dartmoor.</p>
			<p class="bt">It strikes me that investigating the Corps of Royal Engineers, Fifth Regiment, with whom Robert Winter served and perhaps yet does serve, is the most logical place to seek out the so-called friend who made off with Lady Violet Gaskell’s love letters. After consulting my commonplace book, I find that military men of an engineering bent frequent the Sackville Club. Lady Violet is not expected until the afternoon, and it would do well for me to escape the flat—Mrs. Hudson has tried to foist eggs upon me twice already this morning. This whole business has me so unnerved that I am off comestibles entirely.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Sunday, September 30th, 1888 (continued).</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Damn, blast, and confound it all.</p>
			<p class="bt">The Sackville Club is a comfortable brick establishment in Bloomsbury, so I hadn’t far to travel, which was a lucky circumstance since today the skies have opened and the streets are foul little rivers. I presented myself to the proprietor, who was most helpful in pointing me toward a member of the Fifth Regiment. This gentleman was named Lieutenant Ernest Shattock (engaged to be married, boxing enthusiast, submarine expert, fiancée owns a bulldog). After I introduced myself as a former school chum of a fellow member of the Fifth, he was readily persuaded to partake of a brandy and soda and some leading conversation in the club’s darkly paneled common room.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I heard rumor the lads of the engineering ranks populated this place and thought I might take a chance upon finding my old friend,” I mused, eyes passing idly over the men smoking cigars and playing billiards in the low light.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was well thought out, Mr. Holmes. What’s your mate’s name, then?” Lieutenant Shattock inquired affably, sipping at his drink.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Lieutenant Robert Winter. Or at least, he was a lieutenant when last I heard tell of him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Lieutenant Shattock frowned. “That’s queer. I should have thought I’d know him, but the name isn’t familiar. Joseph! Ever heard of a Robert Winter?”</p>
			<p class="bt">The fellow named Joseph (gambler, dabbles in archery, originally from Glasgow), who was placidly reading the <span class="charoverride3">Pall Mall</span> a few feet away, folded his paper down. “Winter . . . can’t say as I have.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Are you certain he wasn’t a contracted civilian, Mr. Holmes?” Lieutenant Shattock asked. “Or posted to the Corps of Military Artificers?”</p>
			<p class="bt">After I repeated that he was enlisted, the good gentlemen made a few other inquiries for me. All came to naught, however—Robert Winter, the man for whom Lady Violet had unwittingly risked her reputation, has apparently been erased from existence.</p>
			<p class="bt">I quit the club none the wiser, with a brandy and soda disturbing my empty stomach.</p>
			<p class="bt">This doesn’t add up. I highly doubt the engineers were prevaricating. They were steady and thoughtful, as military men often are. Watson exemplifies the type. I hope his revolver is in his pocket. I told him never to be without it, and he generally follows my instructions, but a hound (whether supernatural or the common garden variety) can tear a man’s throat out.</p>
			<p class="bt">Thankfully, Watson is an excellent marksman. When I knew him less well and found myself strangely curious about him, I asked Mycroft to look into his brief military career: apparently he shot a sniper in Candahar at a farcically difficult distance before being posted to the Berkshires, which incident immediately recommended him to me as a potentially useful business partner. I mentioned the event to him once over breakfast. “Remarkable, Holmes!” he exclaimed, tanned face alight. “However could you possibly have deduced such a thing?” He was so pleased, I hadn’t the heart to tell him I’d learned it in a letter from my brother, which flirted with invasion of his personal privacy; thus I merely smiled enigmatically and intoned something philosophical about logic.</p>
			<p class="bt">I’ll never understand the character of military men. Not ­Watson—his lust for adventure is keen enough that he grows as restless as I do when my career lags—but those who send other men into danger. My temperament wouldn’t agree with command, masterful as I am. I should much prefer to take a risk upon myself in solitude than order comrades into harm’s way. I’d make for an altogether wretched colonel.</p>
			<p class="bt">Lady Violet is due to arrive at Baker Street at any moment. There, I think I heard the bell chime.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Sunday, September 30th, 1888 (continued).</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Lady Violet has just now departed, and the note she delivered into my keeping with the blackmailer’s instructions for delivering the ten thousand pounds makes everything clear. God, what a dunce I’ve been all this while. The case appeared so very simple that I allowed its lack of complexity to blind me utterly—that, and I have been somewhat distracted. I should have seen the truth plain as day when Lady Violet said she could tell me no details about her persecutor owing to the dimness inside the carriage. Instead I traipsed about in search of Robert Winter, of all people. Asinine. Watson will howl with laughter when I tell him about it. (And the anecdote will provide the perfect opportunity to implore that he mention Norbury with greater frequency.)</p>
			<p class="bt">“Lady Violet, after copious reflection, I’ve determined that your only course of action is to throw yourself upon the mercy of your aunt’s generosity,” I told her. She nodded, clutching her gloves and looking faintly ill, pale blue semicircles beneath echoing the blue within her eyes. (Yes, it seems that my pen, like the good doctor’s, veers into the overly descriptive when I am not vigilant.) “Lady Cranley must therefore wire the money to my bank without delay. The instructions to deliver the cash to a locker at Charing Cross train station tomorrow at noon exactly will then be carried out by me, as your intermediary, for the sake of safety and discretion. Is all this agreeable to you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nothing about it is remotely agreeable,” she sighed. “But you have done everything you can, no doubt, and you mustn’t think me ungrateful.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not at all. This time tomorrow, Lady Violet, the whole sordid business will be but an unpleasant memory.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thank you, Mr. Holmes.” I took her petite hand, and she made me a small, elegant bow. “I’ll not forget your kindness, nor your talents.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As a sleuth or a florist?” I asked, smiling a little. “I must say, Lady Violet, your fiancé is a . . . memorable man.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The pain in her eyes was evident; the tendons of her throat were taut with regret. It was as I suspected, then. I know nothing whatever of love, granted, but any sane woman ought to be as enamored of Sir Wellesley Lyttleton as she would a particularly cantankerous badger.</p>
			<p class="bt">“He is certainly a rich one, and my aunt owns traditional sensibilities. I can hardly blame her, for she was raised with them. Do you want to know what life I’ve always dreamed of, Mr. Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By all means.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Living in a dear, shabby garret in Florence, painting. I should be quite alone, but I should have my canvases and oils and I should be happy as a lark. Does that sound foolish to you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not in the slightest. Your engagement is, I regret to say, an unfortunate impediment to such a life.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She offered me a weak smile. “That cannot be helped, I fear. But I have complained long enough, and you must have many demands upon your time. Good day, Mr. Holmes. I shall be forever grateful for your kindness during my hour of need.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I shut the door upon her, I rubbed my hands together, marshaling my wild thoughts.</p>
			<p class="bt">I’ve reached a decision of which I think Watson would approve. If I play at being a judge from time to time, he is indubitably a jury, and I believe on this occasion we would be in complete agreement as to our ruling.</p>
			<p class="bt">What a pity I am forced to wait another day before departing. I must pack my things, send a telegram to Cartwright to determine if the boy is game to accompany me, and see that my post is forwarded to Devonshire with the greatest possible efficiency. Cartwright is a trusty lad, practically one of my Irregulars by this time, and I’ve my eye on a suitable cave dwelling. One mustn’t reveal one’s hand too quickly, after all, and I believe dark forces to be massing around Sir Henry. But supposing I mean to reside in a ditch temporarily, I should still prefer to have a clean collar of a morning. Hygiene will not be sacrificed if I can possibly help it. Also, if Watson is dedicated to writing me detailed reports, then by God I am going to read them. Backlit females notwithstanding, they promise to be most invigorating. I should hate to miss them, no matter how many picturesque ruins he describes.</p>
			<p class="bt">I’ve reached the decision to inform Inspector Lestrade of my plans, that I might summon him at a moment’s notice should I have need of a steady Yarder, which is not at all unlikely. Lestrade can no better employ his imagination than he can employ clairvoyance, but in this case that’s all to the good. He is more trusting of me than the rest of the official force, and more tolerable to pass the time with, and it is a cunning game to see just how far I can advance his reputation by giving him credit for my own successes. I could distribute the wealth more evenly, but gifting all to a single individual is much more amusing—if Lestrade were ambitious, he could make chief of police for all the puffing I’ve provided. As he is not ambitious but simply wonderfully decent and rather dull, however, it’s droll to ensure that he solves three times as many murders yearly as Bradstreet or Gregson (despite the fact they’re both brighter than he and for no other reason than because I enjoy the faces he pulls when I twit him over lapses in his logic).</p>
			<p class="bt">How does one approach Her Majesty’s postal service about forwarding correspondence to the open moorland when one is in pursuit of a criminal mastermind? The formality rather escapes me. <span class="charoverride3">“To Be Delivered to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Devonshire, Third Crag from the Left, Grimpen”?</span></p>
			<p class="_-head">Sunday, September 30th, 1888 (continued).</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">It fast approaches midnight. All is in readiness.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mrs. Hudson has finally retired, after accusing me of “pining.” I should have offered a rebuttal to this nonsensical assertion, but it did not merit a reply. Reclining in my armchair smoking shag tobacco for two hours straight is <span class="charoverride3">pondering,</span> not <span class="charoverride3">pining,</span> and it is my profession, for the love of God.</p>
			<p class="bt">I hope this is not a sign of an early descent into dotage upon Mrs. Hudson’s part. She is an admirable landlady, and hardly ever assesses damages when my chemical experiments go unexpectedly awry. This is probably because I already pay her triple what the rooms are worth, entirely apart from Watson’s portion, but I am not inclined to quibble over domestic matters.</p>
			<p class="bt">Watson posted a wire thanking me for the scarf, stating that a far more detailed letter would follow soon after, wishing me luck with the blackmail case, and advising I refrain from meandering into any accidental marital arrangements with under-cooks and kitchen slaveys, as I have done in the past. I will see that he pays for this when we are ­reunited—Watson’s natural turn for verbal banter is beyond reproach, but when his gibes are calculated, he is, and I say this with great fondness, rather juvenile.</p>
			<p class="bt">First things first, however: to assist Lady Violet Gaskell in teaching a lesson to the odious Sir Wellesley Lyttleton.</p>
			<p class="_-head">Monday, October 1st, 1888.</p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">I sit opposite Cartwright in a private carriage hitched to <span class="charoverride3">the slowest train in all of Christendom.</span> The railway will hear from me, and the tone of my letter will not be congenial to them.</p>
			<p class="bt">My plan went off without a hitch. I visited my bank this morning, filled a small satchel with the ten thousand pounds Lady Cranley had transferred to me, and placed it in the designated locker at Charing Cross. Then it was child’s play to blend into the milling crowds for long enough to watch Lady Violet retrieve it. I have never seen a woman look so ­delighted—as if she had been freed from a cruel cage. She will set herself up in Florence in a garret, just as she described, and no doubt do well there. Of course a woman as observant as Lady Violet ought to have been able to tell me <span class="charoverride3">something</span> about her mysterious blackmailer, but since there never was any blackmailer or letters or Robert Winter in the first place, she declined to invent superfluous data lest I catch her in a lie. Elegant. My cap is off to her—I don’t mind being bested on occasion, supposing my antagonist as patently brave and morally justified as is Lady Violet.</p>
			<p class="bt">I considered suggesting that if she ever feels the need to extort her own money from Lady Cranley again, she must not use her own stationery, as it was this slipup that exposed her to me. A comparison of her plea for help with the “blackmailer’s instructions” revealed the truth in an instant. She is such a deft and sensitive painter, however, that I don’t imagine she will have need of any more funds from her family. When she does set up shop, I must remind myself to write to her, and purchase something to remember her by.</p>
			<p class="bt">Good riddance to Sir Wellesley Lyttleton. The man is a boor. Watson will approve of this course of action, I feel certain.</p>
			<p class="bt">Will this train <span class="charoverride3">never reach Devonshire</span>?</p>
