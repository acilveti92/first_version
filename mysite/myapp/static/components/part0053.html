				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack stood on the quayside, looking warily at the city that awaited him. The fort loomed over the place just as he remembered, and if he tried hard, he could smell the olfactory horror that was the covered bazaar. It was his second visit to Bombay, and he had learnt his lesson. He would not waste any time there.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">At least he would be in better surroundings than before. He waited patiently for the coach that would usher him into the serene and worldly comforts of the Hope Hall Family Hotel in Mazagon. Thanks to the valuables he had stolen all those weeks ago from Abdul at the Hotel Splendid, he could now afford to stay in comfort, far from the peril of midnight murderers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">For the first time, he would be able to register in his own name. Ballard’s gift had been a set of freshly issued discharge papers. They vouched that the man carrying them had been allowed to leave the army honourably, freeing him from the ties of the Queen’s service. Ballard had given Jack the one thing he had craved for so long.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had given him back his name.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A fine carriage pulled up in a jangle of horse tackle and squeaking timbers. The door opened and a servant dressed in the fine livery of the Hope Hall hotel jumped from his perch at the rear and raced forward to lower the steps that would allow Jack to enter with dignity.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stepped forward, but hesitated as he started up the steps. He remembered the last two occasions he had entered an unfamiliar carriage. He shivered at the memories. It was time to move on. He had to leave his past behind.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack snorted as he scanned the newspaper. The <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Tehran Gazette</span> usually made for an interesting read, its news more current than even the most recently arrived <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Times</span>. The paper’s fanciful account of the Persian victory at Khoosh-Ab had made him laugh aloud. The description of the triumphant Persian forces pursuing a broken British army back to the coast read like an account from the distant past, the windy style presenting a clear picture of Persian valour and British cowardice. It was only as he read of the supposed destruction of several British squares that his laughter died, the memory of the slaughter at the real battle too fresh to be a matter for humour.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He read with sadness that the Persians claimed to have killed at least one thousand British soldiers. They also lauded the death of Major General Stalker. Jack had learnt of Stalker’s death only three days previously. The man who had led the British to victory at Reshire, and then commanded the two divisions for most of the day at Khoosh-Ab, had killed himself, committing suicide shortly after Jack had left the army.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack could not begin to understand what could have driven Stalker to such an act at the moment of his greatest success. It was a sad end to a fine career. Despite everything Jack himself had endured, he had never considered the same solution for his own suffering. Even in his loneliest, darkest moments, he had not once thought of lifting his revolver to his head. He would never let himself give in.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had experienced a different rush of emotion the following day when he had read that Commodore Fetherstone of the Indian navy had also killed himself. He could not help but wonder if anyone would suspect some skulduggery when they learned that two of the most senior British officers had killed themselves in such a short space of time after such a fabulous victory. Yet it was no longer his concern, and he forced the thoughts from his mind and sat back in his chair.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Sahib, your carriage is ready.’ A servant bowed low as he addressed the British officer, who stared into space, clearly lost in a different world.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack didn’t hear the summons. His mind was replaying the moment when he had pulled the trigger and sent Fetherstone’s corrupt soul to meet its maker. He saw the look in the spymaster’s eyes as the trigger tightened under his finger, the last moments of the man’s life etched into his soul.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sahib.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The memory fled back into the recesses of his mind. He snapped the <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Gazette</span> shut and tossed it to the floor, the only suitable resting place for a newspaper filled with such dross, then pulled himself to his feet, straightening his waistcoat as he stood up. It still felt awkward to be without a uniform, but at least he was no longer an impostor. The ticket on the Peninsular and Oriental steamer was made out in the name of one Jack Lark, Esquire. He had booked passage on the first ship out of Bombay, not wanting to risk staying a moment longer than was necessary in the city where he had lived as Arthur Fenris. The steamer was bound for Calcutta, where he would have to wait before he could board another P&amp;O ship that would take him to Suez. From there he would travel overland to Cairo to pick up the last connection in his long journey. For Jack had decided it was time to return to the one place where he could be himself.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was going home.</p>
