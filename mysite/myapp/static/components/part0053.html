				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack had seen the lancers long before they spotted him. They rode towards him slowly. He waited for them patiently. He knew there was every chance that they would take one look at the white-faced man in the blue lancer’s uniform and kill him out of hand, but still he sat and waited, the bloodstained talwar left in its scabbard.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The lancers came close. There were eight of them. All were old men whom he did not know from his time in the fortress. But he recognised the man who led them.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He should’ve listened.’ Jack spoke loudly as the lancers approached, his bitter words the only greeting he would give.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Count Piotr Wysocki said nothing. He halted his escort and contemplated the weary rider in front of him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He finally broke the silence. ‘He is a proud man. He did what he thought was right. We cannot judge him.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack clenched his jaw, biting off his anger. ‘Were you there?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The count shook his head. ‘I was left behind.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack heard the acid in the words. The former commander of the Maharajah’s lancers had remained in the fortress with the rest of the old men and the boys too young to fight. The only ones not trusted in battle. Now the party of decrepit lancers was the sole force the beaten Maharajah could muster, the ancient warriors forced back in the saddle to do their master’s bidding once more.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Yet you stayed.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Count Piotr nodded, his face grave. ‘Yes. I stayed. I had started to think my time here was done. Now, I think, it has just begun.’ He looked Jack hard in the eyes. ‘It is a strange thing, loyalty, is it not, Jack? It binds us to our fate, no matter how much we like to think we can choose.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack thought on the count’s words. His own notion of loyalty had bound him to the British. It had led him to forsake the Maharajah, to fight against the man who had saved him. In the aftermath of the battle, Proudfoot had claimed that he had made the difference, that his actions had been decisive in handing the British their victory. The notion shamed him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He will listen to you now.’ Jack forced himself to speak, to not dwell on the emotions the count was stirring. He was no longer certain where his loyalty lay, what path his future would take.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He will. He has no one else. The rest have forsaken him. They have abandoned the palace, taking anything of value. Only Lakshmi remains. He has lost everything.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack turned in the saddle. He looked at the pathetic corpse draped over the saddle of the horse he had taken from the field of battle. The Maharajah had paid a high price for his ambition.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I would take him his son.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The count kept his eyes on Jack’s. Then he nodded, acquiescing to the request.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Nothing more was said as the lancers formed up behind their former general, taking position around the body that Jack had brought out of the bloody carnage. Their brooding silence wrapped around him. He gave no command, but walked his horse forward, knowing they would follow.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The Taragarh looked deserted. Jack led his escort up the long sloping ramp towards the heavily protected gates. This time there was no traffic, no carts jostling and pushing as they were forced to wait for entry. The gates were open and unguarded. The mighty fortress of the maharajahs of Sawadh had finally been overcome. Not through siege or escalade, but by the complete defeat of the army that defended the walls and guarded its gates.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A single rider rode to greet them. At first Jack thought it was a boy, the only one left to greet the remnants of the lancers who had ridden from the same fortress with such hope and pride just days before.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He halted the lancers, letting the rider approach. It was only as it got closer that Jack recognised the slim figure, the face that had once beguiled him now grey and stricken with grief and fear. Lakshmi’s eyes searched his face, as if trying to find something she had lost.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack watched as she looked past him and saw the body he had come to deliver. Her eyes betrayed nothing, yet he saw the tears as she pulled at the reins, turning away from the man who had come to destroy any lingering hope in her heart.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He followed her, entering the Star Fort for the last time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘You are a brave man, General Lark. Or a foolish one.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack turned as he recognised the voice. He had been standing in the room of the Ramayana paintings. He had walked the familiar corridors of the palace, the memories of his life there haunting him. The place was deserted, the fabulous decorations intact but somehow now faded, as if life itself had fled. He had found himself in his favourite place, his feet taking him there without conscious thought. He had thought to rest, his battered body begging for some respite. He was still wrapped in the grime of the battlefield, the blood of his enemies mixed with that he himself had shed. He had hidden the filth under the dusty blue uniform he had retrieved from its hiding place, and now he faced the Maharajah dressed in the trappings of the life he had forsaken.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘It was my duty.’ Jack’s own voice was cold.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah said nothing. He stared at Jack for a long time. Neither flinched from the scrutiny of the other. Jack saw the pain etched into the king’s face, the grey pallor of grief stealing the vibrancy from his face. He looked as empty as his palace, his vitality swamped by the bitterness of defeat.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Thank you.’ When the Maharajah spoke, it was barely even in a whisper. ‘Thank you for returning my son to me.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He needed to be brought home. I was honoured to escort him.’ There was little sympathy in Jack’s voice. There had been too much death for him to feel pity.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah cupped his hand over his eyes. Jack could see the shudders that racked his body. When the hand fell away, he saw an old man.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You and the Count were right. You English do not accept defeat.’ The words were spoken without emotion, the Maharajah’s eyes blank.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You must do as they tell you now. You will be treated well.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah waved the words away. ‘Nothing matters any more.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Of course it matters.’ Jack’s voice was brittle, but it was sharp too. ‘Your people need you more than ever. You led them to this place. You cannot forsake them now.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah looked as if he had been slapped. ‘Do not dare to tell me my duty.’ He was vibrating with emotion, his face stricken with a mixture of grief and despair.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I dare tell you, for it must be said.’ Jack spoke without hesitation, the voice of an officer to a subordinate. ‘You chose to go to war. Now you must deal with the peace you have forced on your people.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He let his hand fall to the hilt of his sword. His fingers brushed the sharkskin grip. It was mottled now, stained with blood and with sweat. It was no longer the pristine weapon of a prince. It was the bloody tool of a killer.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The blade rasped as he pulled it from the scabbard, the noise loud in the quiet of the room. The balance of the weapon was still perfect, and Jack held it in his hand, feeling the power of the beautiful steel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He reached across with his left hand and took hold of the blade. The edge was notched and pitted, the marks of combat etched deep. He had done his best to clean it, but flecks of blood were still stuck in the swirling script that decorated the talwar’s faces, the residue of men’s lives embedded in the steel.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He hefted the sword, then turned the blade, offering it hilt first to the Maharajah. ‘This is yours.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Maharajah said nothing. He looked at the sword. His hand twitched, the fingers reaching instinctively to take the grip, then went still. He looked at Jack, fixing him with a stare that contained a spark of his former power.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No. I have no need of a sword any more. The days of fighting are done. It is yours and yours alone.’ He stood back, taking a step away from the man he had once sheltered. ‘You are right to chastise me.’ He looked at Jack for a long time without speaking. ‘I think perhaps I underestimated you, Jack Lark.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Perhaps.’ Jack had endured enough of kings. He felt the urge to leave, to get away from men with ambition. He suddenly felt foolish, standing holding out his sword in some theatrical gesture. He reversed the blade and thrust it back into its scabbard, a flicker of anger forcing away the sadness that had engulfed him since he had first seen Lakshmi riding towards him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Perhaps.’ The Maharajah repeated the word softly. Then his face hardened. ‘I will do as you say. I must lead my people, even though my heart is broken and my country will be swallowed by you monstrous British.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You must. The time for resistance is over. A new agent will come. He will treat you better than Proudfoot. He will ask you to sign another treaty, one that will let us rule here. Your time is done.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack had nothing more to say. Too many men had died for him to feel sympathy, their lives sacrificed at the altar of the Maharajah’s pride and Proudfoot’s ambition. He took a step back, preparing to leave the Maharajah for the last time.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Where will you go?’ The Maharajah stopped him before turning and sitting heavily in a gilded chair that faced the window.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I don’t know.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘What of Miss Youngsummers?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack bridled at the sudden flurry of questions. ‘She has no need of me. She needs a good man, not a killer.’ He remembered Isabel’s face as she had dressed the wound to his arm. He had seen her fear, her tiredness. He could not stay in her life. She deserved more.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Perhaps you are both.’ The Maharajah looked past Jack. He was staring at the small courtyard outside the window. The ornate fountain at its heart was silent, the water that gave it life gone.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked at the man who had once been king. ‘No. I am one and one alone.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He said nothing more. He left the Maharajah to stare into nothingness and walked away.</p>
