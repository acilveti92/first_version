				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">There was no joy at what they had achieved. No cheers of celebration. No shouts of victory. The fusiliers had paid too high a price. The officers re-formed their companies, the reduced ranks and missing faces a reminder of the men who had fallen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The terraced slope that ran down to the Alma River was covered with redcoated corpses. On the right flank, the 7th Fusiliers under Lacy Yea were still engaged in a dreadful war of attrition with the second Russian column, which was slowly grinding the British ranks into oblivion. The other two battalions, the 19th and the 23rd, were picking their way up the slope towards the redoubt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">For the moment, the King’s Royal Fusiliers were alone. The respite would not last for long; the Russian general was sure to try to recapture the redoubt. He could ill afford to leave such a strategic strongpoint in the hands of the enemy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The remnants of Codrington’s Brigade would have to defend what they had won.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Sir.’ Digby-Brown thrust a scrap of paper towards his captain.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was scratching the battalion’s initials into the barrel of the cannon that had so nearly escaped.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What’s this?’ he asked.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Butcher’s bill, sir. As best as I can tell, we’re down to forty-nine effectives. We lost Sergeants Shepherd and Adams.’ Digby-Brown’s voice was tight with tension.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Did you see the colonel go down, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I did.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And Flowers?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I did.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown closed his eyes to shut out the tears. With a visible effort, he composed himself, his captain’s calm and measured tones helping to steady him. ‘Mr Thomas is wounded, sir. He refuses to retire and go to the surgeons. Perhaps you would have a word with him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Perhaps he has earned the right to decide for himself.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown opened his mouth to argue but stopped himself. His captain was right. ‘Yes, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, Mr Digby-Brown.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What for, sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘For agreeing with me.’ Jack smiled wearily.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At least it sounds like the French are still attacking.’ Digby-Brown pointed towards the west where banks of powder smoke rolled across the battlefield.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t worry about the French.’ Jack kneaded the small of his back. ‘They can look after themselves. I’m more worried about us. We appear to have been abandoned. I don’t see the guards or any of those Scots bastards, do you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown looked anxiously towards the Alma River. The Duke of Cambridge commanded the 1st Division, which was made up of the Highland Brigade and the Guards Brigade. The two brigades should have been advancing hard on the Light Division’s heels, ready to support their attack as soon as it ran out of momentum or secured its objectives. Instead, they had been halted on the far side of the Alma where they were enduring heavy artillery fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"> ‘Oh God. They were meant to be right behind us.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They were indeed, Mr Digby-Brown. Perhaps someone forgot to tell them that. Nothing would surprise me. I suggest you make the most of the peace and quiet. Tell Sergeant Baker to check weapons and ammunition and see to the wounded as best you can. I expect it will get pretty noisy around here soon.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Digby-Brown hurried off, glad to turn his mind to practical matters.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To the south, the vast bulk of the unengaged Russian army was preparing to fight. Twelve battalions of infantry were forming into more huge columns. The Russian general’s conscript army knew no other way to fight. Three thousand cavalry could be seen away to the south-east. The Russians’ second prepared position, the lesser redoubt, lay untouched on the Russian general’s far right flank, a battery of artillery in place. The fusiliers may have seized the larger of the two earthworks but vast numbers of the Russian force were still waiting to be committed to the battle, their men fresh and eager.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Codrington’s brigade was dangerously exposed. They had to hold fast until reinforcements could arrive. If the Russians recaptured the great redoubt, the whole bloody assault would have to be repeated and the sacrifice the redcoats had already made would count for nothing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We made it, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked up at his orderly, unable to summon the energy to greet him with more than a thin smile. Smith had lost his shako in the assault but otherwise appeared to have survived unscathed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Smith reached forward and prised Jack’s sword from his grasp. He bent down to clean the bloody blade on the jacket of a dead Russian gunner. ‘Those Russians were lousy shots. Somehow they managed to miss Slater’s hulking great arse.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘The bastard can’t be so lucky all day.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He won’t be if I have anything to do with it. I’ll worry about Slater; you concentrate on looking after yourself. You charged those bleeding Russki gunners like a madman.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t worry about me. I lead a charmed life.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fucking foolish thinking, that is. Now give me your revolver. I’ll bet you’ve forgotten to reload it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack meekly handed over his revolver and its pouch of ammunition, and took back his hastily cleaned sword. Slater was almost as much of a threat to his survival as the Russians, it would take a miracle to survive the day.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Stand to! The bastards are coming!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The handful of piquets that Codrington had thrown forward hastened to rejoin their battalions.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To the south-west a fresh Russian column was making its way across the sloping high ground towards the great redoubt. The column was enormous, much bigger than the one beaten back by the 19th and 23rd. The period of peace had been short and the fusiliers had been given little time to reorganise.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The three battered battalions formed a single long line. The King’s Royal Fusiliers were on the right, closest to the column. They would be the first to open fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Major Peacock had emerged from wherever he had been hiding. Someone had managed to secure Colonel Morris’s massive black charger and Peacock rode forward on it to stand in front of the fusiliers and address them. The horse fought the major’s unfamiliar control and he had to pull sharply on the reins.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack swore under his breath. The thought of Peacock being in charge of the battalion was galling. He was spared from listening to whatever poppycock Peacock believed would stir the men to fight because he could not hear what he said through the rattle of French and Russian musket fire to the west. Mercifully, the major’s speech did not last long. If he had expected a rousing cheer for his efforts then he was disappointed. The fusiliers greeted his words with stony silence, instead busying themselves with the last-minute preparations of men about to fight. They checked and rechecked their rifles and their ammunition, fidgeted with their pouches and adjusted their uniforms.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Battalion! At two hundred yards, volley fire! Ready!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers lifted their rifles and sighted the muzzles on the enormous mass that rumbled across the slope towards them. There were enough men in the column to outnumber the brigade three or four times over, more men than had been in the whole of the Light Division when it had first formed up that morning. The pulsating mass of Russian conscripts cheered wildly as the drums drove them forward with their hypnotic rhythm.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"><span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Boom-boom. Boom-boom. Boom-boom-boom</span>.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"><span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Boom-boom. Boom-boom. Boom-boom-boom</span>.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"><span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Boom-boom. Boom-boom. Boom-boom-boom</span>.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fingers of hundreds of fusiliers tightened on their triggers. Men drew in a breath, releasing half to steady their aim, their muscles quivering with expectation, the slightest increase in pressure on the trigger all that was needed to send the Minié bullet spinning towards the massed ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t fire! Don’t fire!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The panicked shout came from Jack’s right, from somewhere towards the centre of the long line. The fusiliers lifted their eyes from their sights and looked at each other in consternation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t fire! For God’s sake, don’t fire! It’s the French!’ Major Peacock spurred his charger forward as he shrieked at the battalion, waving his hat to attract their attention. The buglers picked up the command and the call to cease fire was repeated.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The huge column moved steadily closer, oblivious to the confusion in the redcoats’ ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack squinted at the advancing column. Every instinct in him screamed that it could not be the French. It simply did not make any sense that a French column would be advancing towards the redoubt from that direction. As Jack stared at the column, his eyes watering with the strain, sunlight glinted off the pointed metal helmets that the approaching men were wearing. Only one army wore the spiked helmet. The column was Russian.</p>
