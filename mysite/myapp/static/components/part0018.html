<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter013">THIRTEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">The bell summoning the college to dinner at midday still clanged incessantly long after the Fellows and students had filed into the Great Hall, marking time over the susurration of urgent whispered conversations that betrayed the tension crackling in the atmosphere like the charge before a storm. Outside, the rain beat against the windows so hard that we had to raise our voices to make ourselves heard even to our neighbours.</p>
<p class="indented">I was disconcerted to find that a place had been saved for me at the High Table with the senior Fellows. Seated between Richard Godwyn, the librarian, and Slythurst, who made no effort to disguise his distaste at my presence among his colleagues, I could not help but be aware that the seat I occupied must surely have belonged to one of the two dead men.</p>
<p class="indented">The High Table was raised up on a low dais that gave me a vantage over the rest of the hall. It was a handsome room, its walls whitewashed and hung with tapestries in the French style of the last century that were clearly expensive work, though now grown somewhat faded with age. The hall was dominated by the open hearth that stood in the centre of the floor beneath an octagonal louvre set in the high timber roof, its beams blackened with soot, to allow the smoke to escape. Around the hearth was a wooden pale, wide enough for several people to sit on and warm themselves; either side of this, a long table had been set beneath the windows, where the undergraduates and junior Fellows now crammed themselves on to benches with frequent glances at the dais, murmuring among themselves about the rector’s drawn face and the second empty place at the High Table.</p>
<p class="indented">A skinny young man with unkempt red hair, dressed in a gown several sizes too large for him, mounted the lectern that stood beside the High Table and in a voice surprisingly sonorous for his slight frame, began to pronounce Grace. I recognised him as the boy I had watched clearing away the appurtenances of Matins in the chapel the previous day. The solemn tolling of the bell was silenced just as he opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Benignissime Pater, qui providentia tua regis</em>,’ he began, as the rector dutifully bowed his head and clasped his hands and the rest of the senior Fellows followed suit. From beneath lowered lids, I noticed that most of the undergraduates were still watching the High Table with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. ‘<em class="calibre2">Liberalitate pascis et benedictione conservas omnia quae creaveris</em>,’ the boy continued, and I noticed with a sudden pitch of relief that Gabriel Norris was seated at the head of one of the long tables among a clutch of other young men whose quality and cut of dress marked them out as separate from their fellow scholars. I did not take seriously Slythurst’s suggestion that the instruments of murder pointed to Norris as the killer – it seemed to me rather that the use of his longbow implied his innocence, but at least now I would have the chance to speak to him after the meal. He continued to stare resolutely ahead of him, as if the deference of bowing his head in prayer would be beneath his dignity and it occurred to me that there was something altered in his appearance, though I could not quite put my finger on what it might be. On the far side of the other table, I spotted Thomas Allen, head bent so far that his nose almost touched the table, the clasped hands in front of his face gripping one another so tightly that the knuckles were bone-white.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Per lesum Christum Dominum nostrum, Amen</em>,’ finished the red-haired boy, and a muttered ‘Amen’ echoed in response from the tables. The rector rose heavily to his feet and a wary silence settled over the hall.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gentlemen,’ Rector Underhill began, his voice drained of its usual bombast, ‘in the life of every Christian man there come times when God, in His divine and infinite wisdom, sees fit to test our poor faith with hardships and sorrows. Just so, in the life of our little Christian community, He has chosen these days to send us painful trials, the better to anchor our faith in His Providence.’ He took a deep breath and folded his hands together in front of him in an attitude of humility. ‘It grieves me to inform you, gentlemen, so soon after the terrible accident that took the life of our dear sub-rector Doctor Mercer, that a second tragedy has intruded on our poor society. Doctor James Coverdale has been mortally wounded, it would seem in defending the college strongroom from violent robbers.’</p>
<p class="indented">He lowered his head; there was a moment’s pause before a rumble of whispered speculation erupted into the stillness. The rector did not try to silence them; rather, he waited until the first wave of shock and disbelief had played itself out, then raised a hand, which he held aloft until the murmuring subsided.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wagers on who’ll be brave enough to be sub-rector next?’ Norris whispered to his friend, just loud enough for his voice to carry, and a ripple of tense laughter spread around the undergraduates’ tables. The rector cleared his throat sternly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘If anyone saw anything over the weekend that might have some bearing on this horrible act or could lead to the apprehension of these evil perpetrators, you may leave word at my lodgings,’ he announced.</p>
<p class="indented">Norris turned back to the rector and raised a hand.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Rector Underhill – may we know how much was taken from the strongroom?’</p>
<p class="indented">The well-dressed young men among whom he sat nodded urgently; I wondered if the gentlemen commoners kept their own private wealth there too under lock and key.</p>
<p class="indented">The rector hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah – well – it seems that nothing was actually taken, as far as we can tell. It must be that the altercation with Doctor Coverdale frightened the thieves and caused them to take flight.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘An odd sort of robbery, then,’ Norris observed, his words weighted carefully. ‘To take a man’s life, all for nothing.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Indeed, indeed,’ said the rector solemnly. ‘A terrible waste.’</p>
<p class="indented">The meal passed largely in silence among those of us at the High Table, though there was no lack of fevered hypotheses being aired among the junior men seated below us. On my right, Master Godwyn kept his eyes fixed on his plate and said almost nothing, but I noticed that when he lifted his tankard to drink, his hand was trembling like a man with palsy. Slythurst, on my left, occasionally put down his knife to comment between mouthfuls on the lax security that he believed had led to the deaths of his colleagues, as if he did not know very well that in both instances the killer had gained access with a key.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The college should have a proper watchman on the gate,’ he opined loudly, through a mouthful of bread. ‘Cobbett is too old and too drunk to be of any use – why, a whole company of armed militia could march straight past his window and he wouldn’t notice. As for that aged mutt of his – the college needs a proper guard dog, trained to deter intruders. And the main gate should be locked at all times, so that only those with a key can be admitted.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I think, Walter, that a vicious dog is probably not what the college needs at this time,’ Godwyn said wearily, raising his head for a moment. ‘And we are a community of scholars, not a prison. We cannot lock the world out nor our young men in. Besides, think of the expense in issuing all the undergraduates with keys to the main gate.’ He shook his head and seemed to retreat inwards to his own thoughts again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Master Slythurst, as bursar you must be frequently burdened with the task of having new keys cut for the various locks about the college?’ I said pleasantly, attempting to cut into a slice of boiled mutton.</p>
<p class="indented">Slythurst flashed me a furious sideways glance, as if to let me know that he divined my implication, but in the hearing of the other Fellows, he merely said,</p>
<p class="indented">‘Indeed. It is a considerable expense – people are forever losing or breaking them.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And must this onerous duty always fall to you, or do you sometimes charge others with the errand of visiting the locksmith?’ I continued, in the same innocent tone.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is a duty I undertake myself,’ he replied, his voice tighter now. ‘Where the security of the college is concerned, one cannot be too careful.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And sometimes, perhaps, it is necessary to make extra copies of keys to certain doors, to keep some in hand against future losses?’ I reached out for the jug of beer.</p>
<p class="indented">Slythurst scraped his chair back and rose abruptly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘If you have something you mean to ask of me, Doctor Bruno,’ he said, through his teeth, ‘have the courtesy to speak frankly. But at least show some discretion – or do you believe you are now made Inquisitor over us?’ He turned to his left to include the rector in his furious glare, then pushed roughly behind my chair and, without looking back, strode out of the hall in majestic offence, his gown sweeping behind him. The whispering at the lower tables ceased while intrigued eyes followed Slythurst’s progress to the door, before a fresh wave of huddled conversation rippled through their midst.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What has stung him?’ Richard Godwyn asked, looking up from his meat at Slythurst’s brusque departure.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps he is distressed by the tragic news,’ I suggested.</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn blinked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who can tell? Men are harder to read than books. Perhaps Walter is plagued by remorse.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Remorse?’ I asked, concentrating on my plate so as not to betray my interest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He and James detested one another,’ Godwyn confided, his voice low. ‘So perhaps, now that James has died so terribly, Walter regrets the words he can never take back.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why did they hate one another?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn sighed and shook his head sadly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I never knew. I had the impression that each knew something damaging about the other, and that they were somehow unwillingly bound to one another in secrecy. But of course it is always dangerous to make such a pact with an enemy.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Could it be something to do with land leases?’ I asked, remembering suddenly the aborted conversation at the rector’s dinner on my first night, when Coverdale had insinuated that the bursar was implicated in the rector’s deals with Leicester to give away valuable revenues. ‘Perhaps Doctor Coverdale knew of some corrupt scheme of that kind?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn only turned his large, sad eyes on me slowly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I suppose that is possible. I do know that James thought he had reason to distrust Walter – sufficiently to try and persuade the rector that he should not continue in his position.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Coverdale had tried to get rid of Slythurst?’ I whispered, leaning as far away from the rector as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He told the rector he did not think Walter trustworthy – I know this only because the rector came to ask me my opinion of him. I said I had never found any warmth in the man, but I had no reason to believe he was failing in his duties.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And that was Coverdale’s suspicion – that he should not be trusted with the college funds?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I presume so,’ Godwyn said innocently. ‘I cannot think what else it might have been.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Something to do with his religion, perhaps?’</p>
<p class="indented">Godwyn laid a warning hand on my arm then. ‘Some questions are best left unspoken, Doctor Bruno. I have no reason to believe Walter Slythurst is anything other than loyal to the English Church. But in any case, he is safe now – the dead take their secrets with them.’ He raised his head to the window for a moment, then turned to me, laying down his knife, and dropped his voice even further. ‘But this story of robbers in the strongroom – it troubles me greatly.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You do not believe it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘With anyone else it could be believed, but James, you see – I would not wish to speak ill of a late colleague, but anyone who knew James would tell you he was the most terrible coward. He was the very last man on earth who would take it upon himself to tackle armed thieves single-handed. This is why it seems so – strange.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is your explanation?’ I asked, bending my head closer to his.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not know,’ he said warily. ‘But that is two of us dead in as many days. It is enough to make one afraid.’</p>
<p class="indented">I was about to ask who he meant by ‘us’, when William Bernard leaned around from Godwyn’s right and fixed me with his watery eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You ask a great many questions, Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Two tragedies in two days, Doctor Bernard – such coincidences provoke many questions, do you not think?’ I replied.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is obvious. God is punishing the college for her perfidy in religion. He will not be mocked,’ Bernard said, in a tone that brooked no argument.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You mean to imply that Doctor Coverdale needed to be punished?’</p>
<p class="indented">Bernard’s eyes lit up with anger.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I imply no such thing, sorcerer. Only that we are all suffering the wrath of God for our disobedience. He is pouring out his judgement upon us, and who can say where His justice will fall next?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where do <em class="calibre2">you</em> predict, Doctor Bernard?’ I said, leaning closer.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Enough questions!’ Bernard said, banging his bony fist hard on the table so that ale sloshed over the rim of his cup.</p>
<p class="indented">‘William,’ Godwyn said, laying his hand over Bernard’s, his tone placatory. Bernard shook him off angrily and retreated into simmering silence.</p>
<p class="indented">The rector leaned across on my left, his brow creased.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Discretion is all, Bruno.’ His anxious glance took in the animated talk of the young men at the lower tables. ‘Speak to them away from the students. Let us give them no further cause for gossip. The worst of this must be contained for as long as possible.’</p>
<p class="indented">He waved a hand then to his right, and the red-haired boy once again mounted the lectern to read a passage from the great copy of the Bishop’s Bible tethered there by its brass chain. The lesson was from Ezekiel, but the boy’s declamation did little to dampen the conversation among the students; though I could not make out individual discussions, from the pitch of their voices and the brightness of their eyes, it was clear that a second violent death in the college had occasioned more excitement than dread.</p>
<p class="indented">After the meal, as the students began to file out, breaching all etiquette I leapt to my feet and pushed my way through to catch up with Gabriel Norris, who was calling out to Thomas Allen to wait for him outside. Norris had just passed through the hall door into the narrow passageway to the courtyard when I reached out and clapped him between the shoulder blades. He gave a sharp howl of pain – quite disproportionate, I thought, since I had only struck him with the flat of my hand, but when he turned I saw that his jaw was clenched tightly as if he were biting back further exclamation. I laid a hand on his arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Forgive me – I did not mean to startle you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno!’ he said, exhaling with forced calm before removing his arm and fastidiously brushing the silk of his sleeve in case I had marked it. ‘What must you think of our college – it is becoming quite the charnel-house, is it not? At least you and I cannot blame ourselves for failing to save this life, eh – they have taken my bow, in any case, so I could not have played the hero again. And what <em class="calibre2">weather</em>!’ he added, with the same inflection, as if the rain and Coverdale’s murder were alike examples of everyday vexations. It was then that I realised why he looked different; he appeared to be growing a beard. At least, his handsome face bristled with the growth of a couple of days; fair as he was, his beard grew darker and would soon be thick and full.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are growing a beard, Master Norris?’ I observed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, not on purpose,’ he said with irritation, rubbing a hand over the stubble on his chin. ‘But I have not been able to find my razor these past two days, and I will not trust my chin again to the college barber. He has the finesse to take off a limb on the battlefield, which I believe is where he had his training, but I allowed him to shave me once and I nearly came away without my nose. What say you, Doctor Bruno – will a beard suit me? It looks well enough on you, but you are dark—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is unlucky that you have lost your razor, Master Norris, just after you had Thomas sharpen it for you,’ I said evenly, cutting off his prattling. Immediately I felt him tense beside me. When he spoke, his voice was harder, as if he had dropped his dandyish air.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">What?</em> Is that a crime now? And what business is it of yours?’ He took a step closer so that his face was inches from mine, and there was quiet menace in his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Peace, Master Norris. I am only enquiring for the rector who might keep weapons in college.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A razor is not a weapon,’ he said scornfully, then stared at me then for a long moment, and suddenly a light of understanding dawned on his face; he let go of my clothes, still staring but now as if he were looking beyond me, as if an explanation only he could read were inscribed on the wall over my shoulder. ‘Do you mean to say Coverdale was killed with such a weapon?’</p>
<p class="indented">When I did not answer, he nodded, his face suddenly hard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I see. And you have been questioning Thomas about my razor,’ he said, his eyes narrowed. ‘Well, then, I must speak to Thomas. You may find me in my room later, Bruno, I do not have time to spare now,’ he said, dismissing me with a terse nod before bending his head into the rain to cross the courtyard. I was about to follow him when I felt a hand on my own sleeve and turned impatiently to find Lawrence Weston behind me with an eager gleam in his eye. Beside him stood the red-haired boy who had read the lesson at dinner.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I said I would find him for you, Doctor Bruno, and so I have,’ Weston said, with a note of triumph. ‘It was Ned, the bible-clerk.’ He elbowed the skinny boy forward. I looked blankly from Weston to his friend.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What was?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Ned</em>,’ Weston said again, impatiently. ‘Who brought the message to Doctor Coverdale during the disputation. You promised me a shilling,’ he added accusingly, as if I had already tried to cheat him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So I did,’ I said, reaching for the purse at my belt. Ned’s freckled face stretched in indignation.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Why should you have a shilling, Weston,’ he protested, ‘when you don’t know a thing about the business?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You shall have a shilling too,’ I said, to soothe him, wishing I had learned more about the value of these English coins before I started handing them out so freely; I had a feeling I may have set my price too high. ‘Well, then? Who asked you to take the message to Doctor Coverdale on Saturday night, to draw him out of the disputation early?’</p>
<p class="indented">I realised that in my anticipation I had grasped the boy’s shoulders and was half shaking him. He regarded me with a puzzled frown.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well – <em class="calibre2">he</em> did, sir. Doctor Coverdale, I mean.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What? That makes no sense.’</p>
<p class="indented">Ned shrugged.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s all I know, sir. Before we left college on Saturday night, he cornered me and gave me a groat – he is not so generous as you, sir … I mean, <em class="calibre2">was</em> not – to call him out of the disputation halfway through, on the pretence of an urgent message.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did he say why?’</p>
<p class="indented">Ned shook his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Only that he had to return to college early but he needed an excuse to walk out.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He did not say if he was meeting someone?’</p>
<p class="indented">Ned wriggled impatiently under my hands.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He said nothing else, sir. I took my groat and did as I was bid, and that was all I knew of it until just now.’ Suddenly his eyes grew large with the drama of the event. ‘Do you think that’s when they got him, sir, when he came back to college early?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You didn’t see if he met anyone outside the Divinity School after you gave him the message? A man with no ears, perhaps?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, sir, but I know the man you mean,’ Ned said, his freckled face lighting up as if he had answered a difficult examination question. ‘But it was Master Godwyn was meeting <em class="calibre2">him</em> outside the Divinity School, not Doctor Coverdale.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Godwyn?’ I repeated, uncomprehending.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I saw him meet the man you mean, the bookseller Jenkes, outside the Divinity School while I was waiting to give the false message to Doctor Coverdale. But then I followed Doctor Coverdale all the way back to college after that. I thought I’d take the chance to skip off early myself – no offence, sir,’ he added, looking suddenly guilty; I shook my head briefly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You missed nothing, I assure you. But Coverdale – you saw him go straight to his room?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, sir. That’s to say, I saw him going into his staircase.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you saw nothing else unusual? No one abroad in the college?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, sir. Only—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What?’ I asked, my voice rising higher as I shook him urgently.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well – I have a room above the library, as I have serving duties there and in the chapel. It’s how I pay for my studies, sir,’ he explained, a little sheepishly. ‘Well, as I was climbing the stairs to my room, I heard voices from behind the door.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In the library? Whose voices?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know, but I heard a man’s voice raised as if he was angry. I couldn’t catch the words, though. I just crept past the landing up to my attic as quiet as I could, but they must have heard my tread on the stairs because they fell silent for a moment. Then when I heard the library door close a few minutes later, I tried to look down from my window into the quad to see who it was so I could report them to Master Godwyn.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Could it have been Master Godwyn himself, returned early?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know. They both had cloaks on with hoods up, so I couldn’t tell.’ He shrugged, as if it was of no great interest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, Ned.’</p>
<p class="indented">Defeated, I let go of his shoulders and rummaged again in my purse for another shilling. Next time I needed information, I thought, I would remember to make it a groat. Ned snatched it gladly and grinned; as his fist closed around it, I glanced across the courtyard to see Slythurst emerging from the stairway that led to the library and chapel. He shot me a look of pure loathing and hurried through the curtain of rain in the direction of the rector’s lodgings. So Godwyn had also left the disputation early, in order to meet Jenkes. Could they have returned to the college together in search of Coverdale? Or might they have had other business in the library, perhaps involving those illegal books?</p>
<p class="indented">People continued to shove and press around us as they peered out into the courtyard, trying to decide whether to wait for the rain to ease. I braced myself and skittered across the courtyard into the downpour, weaving around the dispersing crowd of students. Under the tower archway, a small crowd had gathered to watch with interest the arrival of three men in long cloaks and tricorn hats, shaking the water from their shoulders. One carried an official-looking staff with a brass carved head, and I supposed these must be the constables and the coroner, come to retrieve the body. Rector Underhill stood behind them, twisting his hands fretfully while Slythurst tried to keep the undergraduates at bay. I wondered if the rector would tell the coroner about the martyrdom of St Sebastian, or leave him to draw his own conclusions.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Dio buono, amico mio –</em> what a day!’ exclaimed a voice behind me. I turned to see John Florio pulling a cloak tightly around his shoulders as if preparing to brave the weather. ‘You never saw rain like this in Naples, I’ll wager?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not even Noah saw rain like this,’ I replied grimly, casting a glance heavenwards.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Are you going out?’ he said, taking my arm and fixing me with an oddly expectant look as I followed him through the gate into St Mildred’s Lane. ‘Perhaps we could walk together,’ he went on eagerly, without waiting for an answer, ‘I am headed for Catte Street to enquire after some French books I have ordered from a dealer there, and I must say, I will be glad to get away from the college even for an hour, despite this weather. This dreadful attack has left us all quite shaken. Why don’t you come with me? His shop would interest you, I think – his real trade is bookbinding, but he has good contacts with printers in France and the Low Countries and there are often interesting imports to be found, obscure texts that you won’t find elsewhere, if you can tolerate the man himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">We fell into step through the filthy streets, Florio speculating wildly in Italian about the assault on Coverdale, gesticulating with his hands as he talked, while I nodded and murmured agreement in the few pauses he left to draw breath. At the corner of St John Street and Catte Street, I suddenly heard shouting and peals of coarse laughter rang out across the street; we both turned to see a gang of apprentice boys by the Smythgate jostling one another and pointing in delight, jeering and calling out insults. Florio steered me by the elbow away from them as they yelled, ‘Papist whoresons! Get out of England!’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ignore them,’ Florio muttered, quickening his pace as one of the boys reached down to throw a stone and another spat in our direction. They followed us for a few paces but did not have the nerve for more than shouting and eventually grew bored with their baiting.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They are not over-fond of foreigners here,’ I observed as we ducked gratefully into the scant shelter of the overhanging upper storeys of the houses in Catte Street. Florio gave me a rueful glance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is an excuse to make trouble. To the ignorant, all foreigners are Catholics who want to slaughter them in their beds. I live with this all the time, and I was born here. Forget about it, <em class="calibre2">amico mio</em>. Look, we are almost here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is this book dealer’s name?’ I asked, though I had already guessed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Rowland Jenkes,’ Florio called over his shoulder, since there was not room for us to walk two abreast and still have the meagre respite offered by the eaves. ‘You will hear of him before long, I’m sure. He is greatly reviled in the town – they call him a necromancer – but you know how people gossip. Jenkes will find you books that could not be had without travelling to France yourself – and that is of particular value to me. There are those who would not step foot in his shop and will spread malicious talk about any Fellow who does, but I try to close my ears to all that. I have enough trouble here already as <em class="calibre2">un inglese italianato,</em> as you have seen. Here we are,’ he finished, pointing to the low shop front where I had seen William Bernard and Jenkes enter the day before. The shutters were open now, but the windows looked no less dark and forbidding.</p>
<p class="indented">Florio hesitated, then laid a hand on my arm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Forgive me, but before we go in, I must ask you, Doctor Bruno, if you read my note?’ he whispered, his eyes bright with urgency and apprehension.</p>
<p class="indented">I stared at him, speechless.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Your</em> note?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes. I left you a note. Did you not receive it?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well – yes, but – I did not realise it came from you.’ I was still looking at him with incredulity; if the mysterious letter had come from Florio after all, it could only mean that he had vital information about the killings. Why, then, had he not told someone in authority what he knew? Then I remembered what Thomas Allen had said about the rumours of a government spy in the college; Florio, with his languages and his high-born contacts, would be just the sort of man Walsingham might make use of. Perhaps, then, he was afraid to reveal his cover and had been waiting until he could make contact with Sidney and me. I continued to stare at him, waiting for some further clarification. He looked slightly perplexed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh. I had thought it would be clear, for obvious reasons. I am sorry for any confusion.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But, Florio,’ I said, clutching his arm and drawing him in closer; the water from the overhanging timbers above cascaded in sheets to the sodden ground and I had to raise my voice to be heard. ‘Why did you not come and speak to me about this in person?’</p>
<p class="indented">He lowered his eyes as if abashed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is a delicate matter, Doctor Bruno – I thought it best that I approach it in a more formal manner. One must observe propriety in such things.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Propriety be damned, Florio – two men have died and there may be more to follow!’</p>
<p class="indented">He looked at first startled, then his expression turned quickly to fear.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But, Bruno – you think there will be more deaths? What makes you say so?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘We cannot know, until we learn what links these two victims and discover the killer’s motive – do you not agree? And there I think you have something to tell that could illuminate the matter, am I right?’</p>
<p class="indented">Florio stared at me then with a look of utter incomprehension, but before he could reply, the door beside us opened and Rowland Jenkes stood on the threshold of his shop, surveying us with his habitual expression of amused detachment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Buongiorno, signori</em>,’ he said, in that sly, educated accent that so belied his ravaged face, while effecting a little bow that I took to be sarcastic. ‘Not the weather to be standing out of doors, Master Florio. Please, come in, and bring your friend.’ He moved backwards and made a grandiose gesture with his arm to usher us in. Florio looked at me for a moment longer, then lowered his dripping cloak and stepped inside.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter011" class="calibre4">ELEVEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">Torches blazed along the length of the landing stage outside the river gatehouse of the Tuileries. Boats with curtained canopies glided into place, hauled in by boys uniformed in Catherine’s colours, who held the crafts steady for guests in fur-trimmed cloaks and jewelled or feathered masks as they extended their gloved hands and stepped out on to the jetty, slippers crunching on a carpet stiff with frost. The biting wind of the past few days had dropped, leaving the night clear and still; ice glittered on the trees and the sky was a high dome of ink-blue, studded with bright stars and a new-minted moon like a silver écu, blurred at the edges. They said Catherine had borrowed half a million écus from the Gondi bank to finance tonight’s extravagance, so that every ambassador would moan over his dispatches tomorrow morning, resting his pounding head on a fist as he wrote to his master of how the Valois court could still dazzle, how the royal house stood firm and laughed at the rumours of ruin.</p>
<p class="indented">Despite the December cold, people would spill into the gardens later in pairs, or perhaps more than pairs, seeking the shadows of trees and hidden bowers behind hedges. I had only been on the fringes of Catherine’s entertainments on one occasion, but I knew how these nights ended; solitary revellers in drooping costumes stumbling through corridors, masks dangling limp from one hand as the torches burn themselves out, asking forlornly if anyone knows where their husband or wife might be. Best make your way home without them, or find a substitute. For all her stern piety and stiff widow’s attire, Catherine knew how to make sure her festivities were remembered. From behind the walls I caught the rising sound of pipes and viols, gusts of laughter and raised voices. I drew the hood closer around my face. My breath condensed on the inside of the mask and grew clammy.</p>
<p class="indented">We pulled up at a plainer landing stage further downriver, for tradesmen and workers. Jacopo stood and exchanged a few words with the official who waited by the entrance, checking names off on a list; after a cursory head count, he waved us through. I was given a box of stage properties to carry; the rest of the players had kept their masks on too, save Francesco, who had pushed his back to talk to the man with the list. No one gave me a second glance.</p>
<p class="indented">We processed through a maze of back corridors, where uniformed servants with fixed expressions scurried in silence, arms laden with silver dishes, boxes of candles, glass bowls, stacks of velvet cushions, musical instruments or gilt chairs, until at last we were ushered into a small room and told to wait for the Master of Ceremonies. I stood uncertainly, holding my box, as the players moved efficiently around me, until the white-faced boy Ercole took pity on me and lifted it out of my arms.</p>
<p class="indented">‘This might be the moment for you to slip away, Bruno,’ Francesco murmured, strapping an imitation sword to his belt. ‘Ah – this reminds me.’ He rummaged in a box of stage weapons and pulled out my knife, which he had had the sense to make me hide there before we arrived, so that I would not be disarmed at the gate. ‘No one will notice you now, among the guests. Go, drink your fill and make merry with these notorious Frenchwomen, and whatever else you came for. Don’t forget to cheer the loudest when we take our bows.’</p>
<p class="indented">I pushed the mask up on to my head and strapped the dagger to my belt, making sure it was tucked away under the cloak. Now that I was here in the heart of the court, I had little idea of why I had come. Talk to the women, Paget had said. I had only one way into that secret world, but I did not know if she would be willing to talk to me after all this time. Besides, tonight every man would be trying to get close to Catherine’s women. And if it should reach the Queen Mother’s ears that I was skulking incognito in her halls, being kicked into the street on my arse would be the kindest response I could hope for.</p>
<p class="indented">I looked around for Jacopo, but he had vanished to other duties somewhere along the warren of corridors. I was about to wish the <em class="calibre6">Gelosi</em> good luck for their endeavours, but before I could speak, the door opened and a slender, dark man entered the room with a brisk handclap. I twisted my face away and pulled down the mask, hoping he had not seen me. This was Balthasar de Beaujoyeux, the Master of Ceremonies – another of Catherine’s Florentine imports, who had adopted the French version of his name when he arrived in Paris twenty years earlier to take charge of the artistic performances at court. He must be in his early forties by now, though he was still in fine shape; he had been a celebrated dancer in his youth at the court of Catherine’s cousin, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, until an injury had forced him to leave Italy and turn his talents to teaching and choreography. Now he marshalled these great <em class="calibre6">magnificences</em>, as Catherine liked to call them – their extensive casts of dancers, singers, players and musicians, their extravagant staging and special effects – with the fierce discipline and cool head of a military strategist. We had crossed paths a few times when I last lived in Paris; though he had always been courteous to me in the past, I did not wish to attract his attention tonight for fear of word reaching his mistress. He stood in the doorway, neat and wiry in a grey silk suit and velvet slippers, elevating himself on his toes and scanning the room as if checking off each player against a list in his head. As he reached me, his gaze lingered and the echo of my breathing seemed to grow louder inside the mask, but he gave no sign of recognition as his eyes flickered down to the pages he carried.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Welcome, friends,’ he began, in Italian, tucking the paper under his arms and clapping his hands again to ensure he had their full attention. ‘The timing is tight tonight so I need you on and off as quickly as possible. Let’s go through the running order. Your first piece will be straight up after the <em class="calibre6">castrati</em> – with luck the audience might still be sober.’</p>
<p class="indented">Isabella laughed. ‘Always the optimist, Balthasar.’</p>
<p class="indented">He flashed her a brief smile. ‘Regardless, my mistress will be sober all night, so consider yourselves to be performing for her and keep it tasteful. Now then, Andreini—’ he beckoned Francesco over to look at the list. ‘I want you in position in the antechamber before the <em class="calibre6">castrati</em> go on. Is this your full company?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘All of them – but let me see again where we come in?’ Francesco slipped an arm around Balthasar and turned him away from the door as he leaned over the director’s shoulder to examine his schedule; I took the opportunity to edge past him before he could ask the company to identify themselves.</p>
<p class="indented">Outside the dressing room, a brief lull, the corridor unexpectedly empty. I leaned against the wall and adjusted the mask, pulling the hood of the Doctor’s cloak over my head. As long as I kept my mouth shut, I would remain invisible in this crowd, cut loose from my name; there was an undeniable frisson in this thought. The sound of singing voices carried from somewhere close by, tightly wrapped harmonies over the layered instruments of an <em class="calibre6">air de cours</em>. Laughter rippled outwards. I followed the sound along the corridor, head lifted like a dog after a scent. A boy appeared around a corner, skin dark as varnished wood against the blue and gold of his velvet suit. He carried a tray of marzipan sweetmeats fashioned in the shape of scallop shells. I asked him the way to the Grande Salle and he jerked his head in the direction he had just come; I helped myself to a shell as I thanked him. He didn’t stop me, only blinked his large black eyes, impassive, and continued on his way. The passageway ended in a door which opened on to a larger, broader corridor where lugubrious Valois faces in oils glared down from the walls at a procession of men and women in lavish costume strutting their way towards the heart of the palace. I slipped in behind a group and allowed myself to be borne along in their wake, my fingers and tongue still sticky and sweet from the marzipan.</p>
<p class="indented">The Grande Salle had been decked out like an enchanted castle from a chivalric tale. Two storeys above us, the vast carved ceiling was hung with a canopy of dark cloth embroidered with the constellations and figures of the zodiac in gold and silver thread, with paper models of the Sun, Moon and planets suspended at varying heights; if their arrangement lacked cosmological accuracy, it compensated with colour and exuberance. At one end of the hall a wide wooden stage had been erected, surmounted by a painted backcloth depicting a pastoral landscape and bordered by real trees in great earthenware pots at either side. Here five singers dressed as shepherds and a group of musicians were working valiantly through a series of chansons by Claude le Jeune, though their efforts were largely drowned out by the chatter of the guests. Along the side walls, tiers of seating faced one another, the wide space of tiled floor between them strewn with dried petals. Banks of candles glittered at intervals along the walls, pitching wavering shadows up the tapestries and embroidered cloths that hung the length of the hall; more candles flickered in the chandeliers that had been lowered from the ceiling so that they would not singe the cloth of the heavens.</p>
<p class="indented">Opposite the stage, at the other end of the room, was a raised dais spread with crimson velvet and shaded by a canopy of the same, three gilded thrones placed in the centre with less ornate chairs to either side. Garlands of evergreen branches and dried fruits decorated every window embrasure; the air was fragrant with the scent of pine resin, cloves and orange, and something else, heavy and spicy, like the smell of burning incense. In one corner a fountain carved with nymphs spouted wine into fluted glass bowls. Braziers of scented wood had been lit in corners to warm the vast space, whose stone walls and high mullioned windows would otherwise have lent it the chill of a cathedral this December night.</p>
<p class="indented">The effect was magnificent. But it was the people milling around between the banks of seats who compelled the eye. Three hundred already, at a guess, and more still pouring through the main door, in every conceivable disguise. Cardinals and Venetian senators jostled with Greeks and Trojans, knights, Harlequins and Saracens for the attention of milkmaids and Amazons, fairy queens, Turkish concubines or damsels from ancient tales, who swirled and billowed in satins and velvets of sapphire, plum and emerald; candlelight glinted on silks woven with gold and silver thread, capes of glossy fur and bodices shimmering with seed pearls. Headdresses of ostrich and peacock feathers bowed and swayed as their owners curtseyed or bent their heads to whisper behind their fans of ivory and tortoiseshell at the appearance of some newcomer. Earrings, pendants and jewelled belts flashed like knives. And every face hidden behind a mask: painted, trimmed with lace or elaborate embroidery, studded with precious stones or hung with strings of glass beads, some topped with crests of feathers or draped with veils, all lending the allure of anonymity, the promise of throwing off inhibition for the space of a few hours. The air crackled with anticipation.</p>
<p class="indented">I felt a presence beside me and looked down; a dwarf had appeared noiselessly at my side, holding out a tray of glasses filled with some amber liquid. How long had he been there? I could read nothing in the dark eyes that stared out of the slits in the black mask he wore, but instinctively I took a step back. Then, thinking I should not draw attention to myself by acting with undue suspicion, I inclined my head and took one of his drinks, though not the one nearest me. He nodded and slipped away, unnervingly silent for such an ungainly man, and I sniffed my glass; it smelled like a fermented fruit punch, though powerfully strong. As I raised it to my lips, I glanced up and noticed a tall woman with a tiara of white feathers hovering at the back of the crowd on the other side of the hall; her face was almost completely obscured by a mask of ivory silk painted with silver spider webs, but it seemed she was watching me. There was something familiar about her bearing. I moved along the wall for a better view, but people drifted across in front of me and when a space cleared between them, she had vanished.</p>
<p class="indented">I sipped the punch and felt it burn my throat and roar through my veins. It would not surprise me if something had been added to it, some secret ingredient to hasten intoxication. Feeling suddenly reckless, I took another, longer draught and rolled my shoulders back as the tension began to melt away in the heat of the drink; excitement flickered in the pit of my stomach and deeper in my groin at the idea of moving through this company unrecognised. Emboldened, I peeled myself away from the wall and crossed the floor between the banks of seats, half-looking for the mysterious woman in white. From this side of the room a door behind a thick curtain led out to a torchlit terrace overlooking Catherine’s famous gardens. Though the night air was cold as glass, people had already drifted outside to take advantage of the dark, or perhaps just to escape the cloying scent of the incense. I wrapped my cloak tight around me and stepped out, thinking a gulp of icy air might sharpen my senses; much as I wanted to, I could not afford to succumb to the temptation to forget myself here.</p>
<p class="indented">I walked to the edge of the terrace, shivering as I watched a couple steal down the steps to the gardens, pulling one another urgently along a path towards a complicit spread of darkness beyond the reach of the torches that flickered along the paths, spilling pools of uncertain light that served to make the shadows between more impenetrable. I swallowed the rest of the punch and placed the glass on the stone balustrade in front of me, tucking my hands inside my sleeves. Almost immediately, a gloved hand placed another full goblet beside it. Jolted out of my thoughts, I snapped my head around to see the woman in the white mask standing to my right, only a couple of feet away, looking at me. She held a fan over the lower half of her face, but I could tell she was smiling. Her height was her most remarkable feature; I could not place her and yet neither could I shake the sense that I had once known her, in another context. She seemed to think she knew me, too; it could be the only explanation for her intent stare, her air of amusement. Though lean, her frame was large, her shoulders broad for a woman, her hands disconcertingly strong and solid in their lace gloves. It was only as I looked more closely at her hands that understanding began to dawn. I raised my eyes and met her mischievous stare again. She gestured towards her drink, offering it to me. I shook my head. She let out a soft laugh, her breath escaping in plumes behind the fan, held my gaze for a few moments longer, then lowered the fan slowly so that I could see her mouth. Despite the ceruse and the painted lips I saw now where I had met her before. She dropped into a deep curtsey with unexpected grace.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Buona sera, Signor Bruno.’ She spoke with a lisp, in a half-whispered little-girl sing-song.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good evening, Your Majesty,’ I replied, with deliberate forbearance.</p>
<p class="indented">The mask was lifted with a squeal of delight. ‘You’ve got to admit, from a distance it’s convincing,’ King Henri said, in his own voice. ‘Even close up, if you’re not too choosy. The Marquis de Tours has been giving me the eye since he arrived, short-sighted old goat. It’s my feet that give me away, though.’ He lifted an oversized dancing slipper from beneath his skirts and pointed his toe in a show of daintiness. ‘What did you think, Bruno – were you tempted, even briefly?’</p>
<p class="indented">I should have remembered this favourite game of Henri’s. The pamphleteers barely had to stretch their imaginations where he was concerned. ‘I prefer women with a less obvious beard line, sire.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘For shame.’ Henri ran his fingers along his jaw. ‘I had myself shaved twice today, you know. And a woman did my make-up, so she ought to know what she was about. I have to avoid my mother, of course. I’m supposed to take part in this masque she’s devised. Another heavy-handed allegory where I save France from ignorance and perdition. I’m tempted to do it in this get-up just to see their faces, hers and my wife’s.’ He sighed. ‘Though Louise has been sick this past week, poor creature. I don’t know if she’ll manage to haul herself out of bed for the evening. I suppose she’ll be too afraid of my mother to do otherwise.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sorry to hear it.’ I gave him a cautious look. ‘Although, if she is sick, perhaps it may be happy news?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, if it is, it’s a holy miracle. None of my doing,’ he said, brusquely. ‘Now listen.’ He took my elbow and led me to a corner of the terrace, shadowed by the wall of the palace. ‘What of this priest? I had hoped to hear from you sooner. It’s been over a week.’</p>
<p class="indented">I hesitated. I had been putting off any contact with Henri partly because I had wanted to speak to Jacopo first about Joseph’s death, and the meaning of ‘Circe’, but mostly because I was afraid that Guise would know immediately if I tried to see the King. I did not think his threats to harm me or Sophia were made in jest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Forgive me, Your Majesty – I was following leads that needed to be verified. These things take time—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘We don’t have time. I expect you’ve heard – there’s been another death. The almoner at Saint-Victor. The Montpensier bitch is up in arms about it, he’s a relative. Is it connected to our priest?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I believe so,’ I said. ‘I think the almoner killed Père Lefèvre on someone’s orders to silence him and was then killed himself for the same reason.’</p>
<p class="indented">He stiffened. ‘Silence him about what?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s what I’m trying to find out. They both worked for the League. The almoner wrote pamphlets against you and Lefèvre carried them to the printer. That’s how they knew one another.’</p>
<p class="indented">Henri clenched his fist. ‘Then it all points to Guise, as I said all along. Can you prove it?’</p>
<p class="indented">I thought of the papers Paget had thrown in the fire at Brinkley’s. ‘Not at present. But they used an English printer by the name of Brinkley at the Palais – you could order his shop to be searched. He might talk if you have him questioned forcefully.’</p>
<p class="indented">He swatted the suggestion away with his fan. ‘He wouldn’t know anything that could implicate Guise directly. The Duke is too careful for that. Though perhaps I will bring this printer in anyway, to make his friends sweat – these English League supporters could do with a sharp lesson. I give them asylum in Paris and the next minute they’re plotting with my enemies. But why was the priest killed in the first place – what secrets were they afraid he might spill? Some conspiracy against me?’ He glanced about him with a theatrical shudder before poking me in the shoulder.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It’s possible—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It must have been. So you need to find out who killed the almoner. And do it quickly. Joseph de Chartres is not some parish priest of no name. He came from a noble family and they will seek justice for him by whatever means serves their purpose.’ He tapped his fan on the balustrade, his body tense.</p>
<p class="indented">I cleared my throat. ‘I think the family may try to blame me for his death.’</p>
<p class="indented">Henri turned, eyebrows arched. ‘You?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Abbé of Saint-Victor caught me searching his cell last week, the night before he died. I was looking for papers that might tie him to Guise or Lefèvre.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And?’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked at the ground. ‘Nothing.’</p>
<p class="indented">He puffed out his cheeks and let his breath escape in a sharp laugh. But when he turned to me, his eyes were hard. ‘Damned stupid of you. How could you let yourself be caught? Abbé Renaud is a notorious tyrant. And no friend to heretics, nor to me. You were lucky he didn’t have you thrown in gaol.’</p>
<p class="indented">I considered, briefly, the consequences of telling the King what had happened that night, but to recount the business of the Conciergerie would oblige me to explain how I had been rescued, and Henri was agitated enough without giving him reason to believe that I now owed a debt to a notorious English conspirator and ally of his greatest enemy. It seemed wiser to say nothing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It will be assumed that you are working for me, of course. The Abbé will make sure the Montpensiers believe that. Christ, Bruno – I thought I could rely on you to be discreet.’ His voice was tight; he picked up his glass and for a moment I feared he might crush it in his fist, or dash it to the ground. Instead he took a sip, winced and shook his head. I lowered my eyes and tried to look contrite.</p>
<p class="indented">Henri wrapped his arms around himself and stared out over the frosted garden, his face sombre beneath the gaudy make-up. From somewhere beyond the reach of the torches came the staccato moans of a woman copulating. He nodded towards the sound. ‘Not even eight o’clock yet. At it like foxes. No wonder my court has a reputation. What can you expect, when my mother deploys a squadron of harlots to spy for her?’ He lifted his head as if to pick up the scent. ‘Did you ever succumb, Bruno, when you were here before? I do recall they took a keen interest in you.’ He turned and gave me an enquiring look. I did not reply. A triumphant smile spread slowly across his face, causing his white paint to crack as he wagged a finger in affirmation. ‘You did! I remember now – the de la Tour girl, wasn’t it? That was the talk anyway. The one who broke down your iron resolve. Was there truth in it?’ He jabbed me again in the shoulder, playfully this time. ‘I command you as your sovereign to tell me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Only the once,’ I said, looking away. ‘The flesh is weak. But there was very little conversation. I knew what she really wanted from me, and she didn’t get it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Huh. She wanted to find out if you were teaching me magic, I suppose? My mother was determined to know.’ Henri laughed. ‘They have talent, those women, no denying it. They know ways to loosen a man’s tongue far more efficient than anything dreamed up in my prisons. You look at my mother and you think, what could that desiccated crone in her widow’s weeds possibly know of such matters? But I tell you, Bruno, she is the subtlest and shrewdest madam in France, as well as the greatest intelligencer. Not an image one would wish to have of one’s mother, but we must be pragmatists. She knows men’s weaknesses better than we could hope to understand ourselves.’ He picked up his glass and turned it by the stem, considering. ‘You should tell that to your friend Francis Walsingham,’ he added, with a sideways look. ‘Tell him he’d learn more by employing nubile young women than men like you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What makes you think he doesn’t?’</p>
<p class="indented">He smiled. ‘Get him to send some over here, then. I’m sure we’d relish the challenge of resisting them. What’s that look for, Bruno – you didn’t think that would be my taste?’ He leaned against the balustrade. ‘I took a mistress recently. Does that surprise you?’</p>
<p class="indented">I was glad he could not see my face behind the mask. ‘A little.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Don’t believe everything you read in street pamphlets. All that “King of Sodom” – it’s a convenient stick for my enemies to beat me with. Which is something else I’d enjoy, if you believe the pamphlets. But in truth, you know, my tastes are far more catholic.’ He paused to chuckle at his own joke, as if it were expected of him, then looked thoughtful. ‘It’s more that, once the business is over, I would choose the company of men over that of women. Would not you? Would not any man?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Surely that depends on the woman, sire.’</p>
<p class="indented">He lifted his chin and grunted a grudging acknowledgement. We stood a moment in silence, considering.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is she still at court?’ I asked, after a while.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who? My mistress?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gabrielle de la Tour.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah.’ A sly look crossed his face. ‘Thinking of trying your luck again? Yes, I believe she came back last year.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Back?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Retired discreetly to the country for an interval. Usual business – got herself a full belly and my mother sent her away before it started to show. Catherine likes to preserve the appearance of decorum, at least.’ He added this with a brief, dry laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘When was this?’ An odd tightness had crept into the base of my throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘After you’d gone.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘How long after?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre6">I</em> don’t know, Bruno, you can’t expect me to remember every – oh. I see.’ He glanced at me, understanding. ‘You’d have to ask her. She’ll be dancing in the masque later on. But try to keep your presence quiet – my mother will have you stuffed and hung from the ceiling with her crocodiles if she finds you.’</p>
<p class="indented">Female laughter gusted out behind us; I glanced back to see a group of costumed revellers emerge from the door to the Grande Salle, jostling one another and shrieking. The King pulled his mask down and nudged me further along the terrace, lowering his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You had better find this killer before the Duchess of Montpensier has you arrested for de Chartres’s murder and tries to bring me down with you. Whoever he is, I will make him talk. I will expose the Duke of Guise before all of Paris as a man who murders loyal Catholics to serve his own ends.’ He gripped my cloak in his fist, his masked face eerie as it loomed close to mine. As he stared into my eyes, his resolve seemed to falter. ‘What is it, Bruno? What are you not telling me?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is always the possibility, Majesty, that it was not the Duke of Guise who ordered the murders.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What?’ He let go of me abruptly and I stumbled back. ‘What makes you say that? Who else would be plotting against me?’</p>
<p class="indented">I held out my hands, empty. ‘I only say that we should keep an open mind. I have made contact with some of Guise’s associates, as you suggested. It seems the Duke is also concerned to find out who was behind the death of de Chartres.’</p>
<p class="indented">Henri grunted. ‘A bluff on his part, no doubt. You be careful, hanging about with his people. Nest of vipers. They’ll tear you apart in a heartbeat if you give them the slightest cause, and I won’t be able to protect you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am well aware of that,’ I said, giving him a pointed look, but the effect was lost behind the mask. I thought again of the burned scrap of paper in Paul’s hearth, and of something Jacopo had said earlier, about messages disappearing inside the palace gates. ‘Who takes care of your letters these days?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Writing them?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Delivering them. Any letters that arrive for you at the Louvre, I mean. Whose hands must they pass through to reach you?’</p>
<p class="indented">Henri made a face that implied he had never given any thought to such procedures. ‘Official correspondence is usually sent by private couriers, who are instructed to put it directly into the hands of my secretary or his representative. As for unsolicited petitions and the like, I suppose they would come to the guards at the gatehouse, in the first instance. Then I imagine some household official collects them and passes them on to my secretary, who decides which are significant enough to warrant my attention. Why?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And your secretary has never mentioned seeing any letter warning you of a plot against your life or your throne in the past month? It would almost certainly have been unsigned, but clearly written by an educated man.’</p>
<p class="indented">He pursed his lips. ‘As I understand it, my secretary burns scores of communications every day from righteous Parisians predicting my imminent downfall and informing me that I am bound for Hell to join the rest of my family. We heat an entire wing of the Louvre with them.’ His tone grew serious. ‘But anything that spoke of a specific danger he would have brought to my attention immediately.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are certain? You trust him?’</p>
<p class="indented">The mask twitched as he frowned. ‘Are you impugning the loyalty of my household? What is this, Bruno? Do you know of such a letter?’ His voice had risen; I held up a hand to calm him and dropped my voice to a whisper.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I found a burned draft of some correspondence in the priest Lefèvre’s lodgings, warning of danger to Your Majesty. That a fair copy never reached you does not mean one was not sent. Any number of people along the way might have intercepted it and decided to find their own solution without your knowledge.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Including people close to me, you’re implying.’ Henri pressed a palm over his mouth under the mask, trying to compose himself. ‘People who chose to keep it from me.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not necessarily. As a League supporter Lefèvre would likely not have risked being seen near the Louvre himself – he could have sent a messenger who read the contents and thought to profit by putting it into other hands. But it may be that it came as far as the Palace and was read by someone there. I only wondered if there was anyone with access to your letters whose integrity you were not entirely sure of.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Christ, Bruno – is one ever entirely sure of anyone’s integrity?’ He reached under his hairnet and scratched at the back of his neck. ‘Everyone has his price. I dare say Guise makes it his business to find out what will buy those nearest to me. So, no – I cannot vouch for all my household servants. But I can vouch for my secretary. His loyalty to my family is undisputed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is your secretary now?’</p>
<p class="indented">He laughed. ‘Of course – you have been away. I appointed Balthasar de Beaujoyeux. He serves both me and my wife as <em class="calibre6">valet de chambre</em>. My mother thought it politic to surround me with her people. She hasn’t always approved my choice of confidants.’</p>
<p class="indented">I thought of the handsome young <em class="calibre6">mignons</em> that Henri had appointed to positions of power over the years, many of them unfit for the job and several of them actively working against him, it had later turned out. Small wonder Catherine had decided to assert her control.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course, it may be that Lefèvre never sent that letter at all,’ I said. ‘I have no way of knowing. But somebody surely found out he was thinking about it – I’m certain that’s why he was killed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What about this de Chartres?’ Henri looked into his glass, as if the answer might be divined in its depths. ‘Since you believe he killed Lefèvre. Suppose the priest confided in him, or asked him to carry the letter to me – he read it, decided to make sure the priest didn’t talk.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But then who did Joseph tell? Who decided – at considerable risk – that he could not be trusted either?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, you know my answer to that. Our friend Le Balafré.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps. But the Duke of Guise did not kill de Chartres with his own hands, I am certain of it. Whoever did that is the link in our chain. He – or she – will lead us to whoever is conspiring against you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then find him – or her, if you insist,’ Henri hissed. ‘Because until you do, this plot may still be active. Suppose it is meant to unfold tonight?’ He reached out for my arm again. ‘All my enemies are here, at my mother’s invitation. She calls it diplomacy – but a masked ball? What possessed her? Anyone could approach me – I wouldn’t know them. What better place to put a blade or a bullet in me and disappear?’ He whipped around as if an assassin might be lurking behind the nearest ornamental shrub, but we saw only the gaggle of women, defeated by the cold and retreating, still shrieking with laughter, back to the hall, pulling their fur capes around them. When they had cleared, I noticed a tall man standing further off along the terrace, looking out over the darkened lawns, his silhouette in profile against the light of a torch. He wore a tricorn hat and a dark red floor-length cloak. When he turned his head for an instant, I saw that he wore a blank white full-face mask, such as the chorus would wear in a Greek tragedy. The effect was unnerving. He turned back; though he was too distant to have heard any of our conversation, and he kept his gaze fixed straight ahead, I had the sense that he was aware of us, and that we were the reason for his presence.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You should be on your guard tonight, sire,’ I whispered. ‘Drink only from the common bowl. Do not go walking in the gardens alone.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘If I take a turn in the gardens, Bruno, I would hardly bother to go alone.’ He smiled, but it died on his lips. ‘What did it say? That letter you found. What danger did he want to warn me of?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘There was almost nothing left of it,’ I said. I laid my hand over his; he was trembling, or perhaps just shivering, it was hard to tell. ‘He wrote only of possible harm, from …’ I hesitated, taking a deep breath. I had carried this name in my head for eleven days, since Paul had rasped it out with his death rattle, not knowing what further danger I might unleash by repeating it. But Henri was right: if the threat of which Paul had written remained imminent, I had no choice but to see if he understood the dead priest’s mythical allusion.</p>
<p class="indented">‘From whom, damn you?’ Henri rubbed his hands together, impatient, his breath clouding in the cold.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Someone called Circe.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre6">What?</em>’ He pushed the mask back on to his head and stared at me as if I had slapped him. ‘How would he—?’ He broke off and continued to gape at me, his jaw working soundlessly as if to form words.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Majesty? You know who this is?’ A curious sense of relief washed through me; if the name meant something to Henri, perhaps the mystery was solved, and he would know how to deal with it without my further involvement. The changing expressions on his face – from shock to fear to anger and back – suggested that my revelation had not improved the situation. He looked like a boy sledging across a frozen lake who had just been told the ice was not strong enough to hold him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is not possible,’ he said, after a long pause, though he sounded uncertain, and it was no longer clear whether he was speaking to me or thinking aloud. His gaze roamed the air behind me for a moment before his eyes snapped on to mine again. He grasped me by both shoulders and shook me. ‘Where did he get this name?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was written on a letter he subsequently burned. He spoke of the confessional. That is all I know.’</p>
<p class="indented">Henri lowered his head, still leaning on my shoulders for support, breathing hard as if he had been running. When he looked up again, his expression was bewildered. Hairline cracks had appeared in the white lead of his face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He said that Circe confessed the intention to do me harm?’ His eyes searched mine for reassurance. ‘I don’t understand. What else?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Nothing else, sire. I understand no more than you. Less, it seems.’ I recalled what Jacopo had said – that Henri always wants someone to solve his problems for him – and briefly pitied him. ‘Who <em class="calibre6">is </em>Circe, sire?’ I prompted, gently, but at that moment I felt him start, just as a presence materialised out of the dark at our side. I looked down to see a dwarf in a black mask bowing discreetly. The same one who had approached me earlier? It was impossible to tell behind his disguise.</p>
<p class="indented">‘To the Devil with you – what is it?’ Henri barked at the man.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your lady mother wishes to speak with you urgently, Your Majesty.’ His voice was thick and guttural. It reminded me of the man I heard in Paul’s rooms, but I could not be certain – perhaps it was a quality particular to dwarfs, like the rolling gait. I stared at him and he acknowledged me with an insolent glance.</p>
<p class="indented">Henri clicked his tongue. ‘Tell her I will be there presently.’</p>
<p class="indented">The dwarf did not move. ‘She has instructed me to return with you in person, sire.’</p>
<p class="indented">The King threw his hands up. ‘Does she think I need a nursemaid?’ It was not clear whether he expected an answer; the dwarf and I remained silent. ‘Very well. But there is someone I must see first.’ He pulled the mask down over his face and turned back to me. ‘Do not leave here tonight without my permission. We will speak further on this matter.’ He patted me absently on the shoulder and walked away, his steps pinched and awkward in his woman’s slippers, the dwarf compact and silent at his side. I glanced along the terrace; the man in the tricorn hat had disappeared. Henri had left his glass behind; shivering, I picked it up and raised it to my lips before recalling my own advice. I replaced the glass on the balustrade without drinking, pulled my cloak around me and returned to the Grande Salle.</p>
