			<p class="bt-1st-para3">It will come as no very stirring surprise to the followers of these accounts that the spring of the year 1894 was a period of extreme adjustment for me in the deepest personal sense. I yet spent my days in sharp remembrance of the dear soul whose life had so brightened my own and, while black coats had eventually been put aside for quiet grey suits with sable armbands and jackets cut rather slimmer than of old, I still was forced to push away dark reflections. Feeling the loss of someone precious, I have found, never occurs when one expects it—when the attention snags upon a petite blonde passing in the street, or the ears catch strains of a dearly loved song. Mary lived in such disparate sights as scraps of embroidery thread and the hairline crack in our front doorstep that always used to vex her so, and rather than avoid her memory, I hoarded these reminders like the newly widowed glutton I was.</p>
			<p class="bt">No less alarming, though a circumstance so impossibly joyful it often threatened to overwhelm my powers of basic comprehension, was the fact that Mr. Sherlock Holmes was now alive and relatively well and residing in Baker Street—and not, as I had weeks previously supposed, lost to me forever at the bottom of a merciless cauldron in Switzerland.</p>
			<p class="bt">As my goal has ever been to polish my friend’s good name rather than tarnish it, and since Holmes’s soft-spoken and sincere account of his falsified death led me to conclude that both he and I had been in mortal danger prior to his . . . disappearance, I shall call it . . . I long endeavored to keep these records free from the suggestion that his return was both a cure and a wound, a burn and its balm. Sherlock Holmes had taken it upon himself to rid London of the vilest criminal network ever created, and apparently my part had been to mourn the fallen hero publicly. That aforementioned hero was still very much alive, however—one might even say spry now that he had eaten a meal or two and slept in a bed—and continually materializing upon the doorstep of my medical practice.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson,” Sherlock Holmes announced after bursting into my consulting room and stopping half-poised upon his toes, “there’s work to be done!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes,” I sighed. “If I am to save this practice, a great deal of work is to be done.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes regarded me with the intensity a sable-headed magpie might devote to a glittering trinket obscured in a mound of rubbish. I sat at my desk, elbows resting upon paperwork which I did not wish to contemplate then or ever; Mary’s illness in its final stages had caused me to all but abandon my post as medico save where she herself was concerned, for there was something unspeakably painful about tending to mild attacks of gout and croup while my wife was dying. I could not bring myself to part from her, and whenever I attempted to maintain at least a semblance of a career, I found my attention too scattered to practice medicine responsibly in any event.</p>
			<p class="bt">At first this negligence of mine was not at issue, for I had money saved. Now, having been on the verge of abandoning London entirely prior to my friend’s dramatic return, I was forced to contemplate the grim reality of my situation. This endeavor proved greatly hampered by my being dragged away at all hours of the day and night to investigate crimes. Why Holmes had determined following the affair I called “The Adventure of the Empty House” that he should invade my office with such regularity remained a mystery, but one I was determined to let lie. I am not, after all, the world-renowned sleuth.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend deposited a small object upon the accounting ledger before me. It was addressed to <span class="charoverride3">Sherlock Holmes,</span> and he had presumably sliced the wrapping meticulously with a letter opener. Pulling back the brown paper, I discovered a used cigar box, and within it a small silver brooch nestled in crumpled newsprint. Though of no great value, it was a pretty trinket. A lock of raven hair, artfully curled, rested in the center of the ornament under polished glass. When I turned it over, I found it had been inscribed with the words<span class="charoverride3"> “Omnes vulnerant, postuma necat.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘All hours wound, the final one kills,’ ” I translated. “This is a remembrance of someone.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A memento mori, yes—at once a reminder of the particular departed and a philosophical meditation that every life is fleeting.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I pushed it away. Holmes whisked his hat from his head and flung it deftly upon one of my two armchairs, followed by his overcoat, which was liberally speckled with raindrops. It had been a cold April, rain lashing down in frigid shards to shatter upon the cobbles, and the skies appeared not to have registered that it was now May. My friend leaned forward over my desk, pale eyes gleaming, with the faint dash of color along his cheeks that meant my morning was about to take a turn for the unconventional.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve accounts to settle,” I said pointedly. “You look much better daily, I am happy to note.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“When you first popped up like a jack-in-the-box, you were half-starved and as pallid as a corpse. This is a decided improvement.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, well, Mrs. Hudson has been relentlessly forcing her heartiest Scotch stews upon me. It is a singular anomaly of human nature,” Holmes mused, continuing to scrutinize his mail with avidity, “that we as a species seem so compelled to mystify what is after all a natural cycle.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not so very singular. I’m engaged at the moment, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are familiar with the Stoics? Of course you are. I’ve always been drawn to the notion that the mind of man is capable of distinguishing truth from fallacy through dispassionate reason, but back when we were all translating Seneca in our form books, I couldn’t help being struck by his preoccupation with mortality. Medieval philosophers built on that foundation to an almost obsessive regard for <span class="charoverride3">transi</span> tombs, architectural renderings of angels snuffing out lights, and skeletons in fantastical states of disrepair.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“While these artifacts are artistic enough in some cases, I always thought paying such extravagant attention to decay rather useless, since it isn’t as if we can stop the march of time simply by marking it. And of course, the practice of wearing physical tokens taken from the bodies of the dead dates back to ancient—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Eleven times.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He blinked. “I beg your pardon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Eleven times during the past fortnight, you have appeared here and have whisked me off to solve whatever conundrums the Yard has failed to clear up in your absence, and my practice was hardly flourishing <span class="charoverride3">before</span> your arrival.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend’s hand dived into the inner pocket of his frock coat, emerging with a folded note. “This accompanied the brooch.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I took it. The missive went in this way:</p>
			<p class="ext-single"><span class="charoverride3">I have read much of your exploits. Save me please, Mr. Holmes, for it is not too late. Single red and white tower rising, faint roar of the train, sun sets to the left, lightning-scarred elm, smell of death. Help me if you are able, for I can tell you nothing more, save that I know I cannot survive here.</span></p>
			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Sherlock Holmes took several tense steps to the right of my desk, and then to the left, drawing his fingertips along the thin line of his lips. For myself, I admit that my pulse thrilled at the obscure but remarkably imperative plea. There can be no comparison between my interest in banking ledgers and my interest in mysterious appeals for aid.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It came through the second post,” Holmes said in his usual clipped, precise manner. “As you can see, no return address is indicated. Peculiar.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That is unfortunate, for her message is most cryptic.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, it is a woman’s writing.” Holmes’s eyes fell shut as he continued to pace. “Tell me what else you can deduce.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But I—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear fellow, I swear to you that your mind, with its altogether unpredictable limitations, is of the utmost value to my thought processes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My having been unintentionally slighted by Holmes for years and all too recently believing that I would hear such backward compliments no more, this remark failed to distress me. I lowered my gaze and did as he asked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The jewelry itself is unremarkable—as you said, memento mori are common enough.” Frowning, I lifted the receptacle. “The wrapping is ordinary brown paper, and the box constructed of inexpensive pine. I can draw no conclusions from either. Doubtless you’ve already identified the newspaper yourself?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The <span class="charoverride3">Evening News,</span> first printing, day before yesterday.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, there you are, then. The accompanying note is hastily written and appears to be penned by an educated woman. Have I missed anything?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course you have.” Holmes made yet another abrupt about-face, tucking his tented fingers under his determined chin. “Though I fear that the physical evidence cannot lead us to a deduction regarding the exact whereabouts of this person. Other than the facts that the note was written in the dead of night, in a cramped, presumably secret space, and that the author has as little idea where she is as I presently do, and has more than likely been in some grim form of captivity for over five months, I can tell you nothing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“However can you have discovered all that?” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">He waved a hand in the air. “There are no fewer than three small drippings of tallow upon the surface of the box and one on the note itself. No great leap of judgment, therefore, to discern that she had both limited light and space in which to accomplish her designs—and since the matter is manifestly a pressing one, this roundabout way of describing her residence can only mean she doesn’t know herself. Otherwise, she certainly would have given me a specific locale.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But Holmes, you claim she has been kept a prisoner for five months or more. How can you have reached so exact a figure?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely we can assume that she has consulted me thanks to the popularity of <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand Magazine</span>, since she reports here that she has read of my exploits, and I make it my habit to avoid the attention of the popular press. In addition, she knows our—my address,” he corrected himself without inflection, “but not my postal code, which is left blank. Her knowledge comes from your tales, not a directory. She has not seen the latest issue, however, which circulated five months ago. Or she would not have consulted me at all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">This inference, like the others, was delivered in that distantly clinical tone Holmes ever adopts when exerting his extraordinary faculty. I expected no less, and no more for that matter, but a hot charge of anger shot through me in spite of myself. For he was right; not only had my last story in <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand </span>garnered an enormous readership, but the newspapers had seen fit to offer their own editorials upon the article’s contents. Surely there was not a free man or woman in London who had failed to notice that Sherlock Holmes was dead—had been dead for three years—and that I had been writing adventure stories about him all the while.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson?” My silence, where of habit further questioning would have followed, prompted my friend to step toward the desk.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s nothing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Frowning, Holmes tilted his head at me. “It isn’t nothing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Leave it, please, I am too far extended of late.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I said never mind. What of the written clues she has provided?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes settled into the chair not occupied by his hat and coat, a worried line firmly fixed between his brows. “They trouble me. Under ordinary circumstances they would not, but as they seem to be the only way to find her and I am just returned from abroad . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">I comprehended him at once, and the realization was unsettling. “You are less familiar with London’s topography than you were.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The detective gazed into the middle distance, which in him always indicates concentration rather than distraction. “One must stringently categorize the value of each detail in such a case as this.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How so?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“To take the data in order of importance, the fact that the house is within earshot of a train will be of use to us only when its locale is more exactly determined, and likewise the sun setting to her left will become relevant <span class="charoverride3">after</span> the building itself is identified, not before. A lightning-scarred tree implies a rise of some kind, an element of height in the landscape, though that is merest probability. It is upon the first and last phrases we must rely, and yet I cannot place them as I normally could.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Single red and white tower rising . . . smell of death,’ ” I read aloud. “The latter is most ominous.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps.” He rubbed at his jawline in frustration. “Perhaps not. The sheer length of her incarceration makes it likelier far that she is in an isolated location rather than a populated area, which to me indicates a country suburb of London. And in order for the smell of death to be a valid guidepost, it must be a constant element of the landscape rather than an occasional one. If the reek of decaying corpses were to blame, suspicions from even the occasional passerby would be alerted and a general alarm would go up. I think it far more probable that the house is downwind of a tannery.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Wonderful!” Perhaps it was my natural affection for intrigue—or perhaps yet again I had simply missed these moments—but I could not help delighting at such casual displays of brilliance. “A tannery likewise suggests the countryside rather than London proper. It’s remarkably well reasoned.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s insufficient!” My friend’s fists clenched briefly, but harder than was usual for such a reserved man. “At any other time, Watson, at <span class="charoverride3">any</span> other time—it’s maddening. Within a few weeks, I should have memorized the new buildings in the outer towns. It’s ghastly to be shackled this way, this wretched feeling of <span class="charoverride3">blank</span> spaces in my mind—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We can find a way to manage,” I promised him, alarmed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“How?” he demanded. “My talents may be undiminished, but my information is outdated. Since the tower is ‘rising’ in the active sense, it is under construction. Yes? Red and white indicate brick and stone combined in a decorative manner, so the project is clearly well funded. I suspect we are dealing with a municipal building of some sort, as ‘spire’ is a much better word for a church tower and the turret of a grand estate would likely not be singular. The best fit is a clock tower, for my money. But that fails to pinpoint—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Croydon!” I gasped. “My God, Holmes. They’re building just such a clock tower in Croydon—they began it the year after you died.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“After I—” Holmes began, and then most uncharacteristically ceased speaking.</p>
			<p class="bt">When once I had heard myself, I could hardly blame the man. With a blank look, he rose from his chair. The casual observer might have thought him absorbed only in the conundrum at hand, but I knew that I had rattled him. It is such a difficult matter to disconcert Sherlock Holmes by design that doing so unintentionally was enough to throw me off my own guard entirely. He did speak soon enough, however, and of the case, as I had expected.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, are you certain this structure is to be found in Croydon?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Unquestionably.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It would not be the first occasion that we were summoned to Croydon by a grotesque package.” My friend’s brows grew stormier by the second.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No,” I agreed, remembering Miss Susan Cushing and her ghastly receipt of salt-packed severed ears some six years previous, during what were for me far happier times.</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend dived across the room for his hat and coat, his spare frame galvanized as if by electricity. Whirling, he found me lost in reflection. A spasm of uncertainty creased the edges of his hooded eyes. The silence that stretched on as he carefully selected his next words proved far too loud for my frayed nerves.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, for heaven’s sake.” Standing, I tucked the note back into the cigar box with its somber pin and passed the package to Holmes. “Is your cab still outside? I’ll just look up the trains.”</p>
			<p class="bt">A grim smile flashed to life upon Holmes’s narrow features as he darted out the door, and I reflected whilst flipping through my Bradshaw upon his curious propensity for sudden disappearances. As a precaution, one I had more than once proved grateful for in times of direst need, I slid my service revolver into my pocket. Its weight, even if the weapon was never called upon, would provide a certain degree of familiar reassurance.</p>
			<p class="bt">The train ride to Croydon was a brooding one, for I think both Holmes and I were too well aware that my having observed a nascent clock tower by no means guaranteed that we were heading in the right direction. Rain continued to pelt the drab row houses and the rubble-dotted yards of outer London, and as we left behind us the great stone heart of the Empire, I fretted over whether my memory would in fact do us service. My information was sound, but were it to fail us, I knew that I would grow despondent over what more I could do. It is not in my nature to shirk responsibility. As for Holmes, I was accustomed to the almost feral energy which coursed through him when he was on the hunt, but on that morning his spirited drive seemed less focused than usual. He would alternately scowl out the window at the drenched trees and cast odd looks at my reflection in the glass.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why do you think she sent the brooch?” I inquired when a copy of the morning paper had proved an utterly ineffectual distraction and Holmes had for the third time heaved a quick sigh through his prominent nose.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I haven’t the smallest notion.” Holmes pulled out his watch, glared at it, and then snapped it closed. “Watson, I once was consulted by a woman who ran a pub in Lambeth. She suspected embezzlement by her eldest son and I proved her correct, but that was the least of her troubles—the property was falling down about their ears, the landlord was a rascal, and hardly a day passed without a riotous brawl during which the patrons cracked each other’s pates open.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah,” said I, entirely bemused.</p>
			<p class="bt">The train clacked onward, and the sun rose higher, and Holmes hissed through his teeth a tiny breath that he was not himself aware of, I am certain. At length, studying an expression on my face which may or may not have been incredulity, he continued.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Her establishment caused her more distress than was tenable. After turning the light-fingered son out on his ear, she took digs with her sister in Newham. The quality of her life improved tenfold.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I congratulate her,” I offered stiffly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Even after the issue of embezzlement was resolved, being the mistress of such an establishment could bring her no pleasure. She was not admitting failure, on the contrary, but rather steering the ship of her life on another trajectory.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Admirable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So you see my point, of course.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I fear I must disenchant you on that count.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I waited for an explanation with my brows mildly raised. But Holmes only fell to chewing at his thumbnail before muttering something about the time the train was making and lapsing into a brown study. Not a word could I get out of him in that state even when I was in my own prime, so I took my notebook from my jacket pocket and attempted to calculate which of my regular patients might be ­induced—with gentlest persuasion—to settle their outstanding bills, the next measure being continuing to wear a hat that had already begun to split at the brim.</p>
			<p class="bt">Our boots sank into thick, mineral-scented mud as we quit the platform of the train station in Croydon. The skies had cleared somewhat, but charcoal-edged clouds still glowered heavily above, and the wind flailed the delicate May leaves with a punishing force. My heart sank when I did not at once set eyes upon the structure I had recommended, but soon I oriented myself aright and angled toward it, pulse quickening.</p>
			<p class="bt">“There,” said I, pointing. “It fits the description, does it not?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Before us rose a half-completed clock tower, the bricks stained a dull maroon by the storm and the white stone shining with moisture. It was a perfectly ordinary building save for the two facts that Sherlock Holmes stood beside me and a fellow creature wanted our help, and so it meant much more; it meant that I was a part of something again, that I could be of some assistance. Labor had ceased during the inclement weather, but a workman with a green cap pulled low over a bullish, good-natured face was wheeling a barrow full of trowels and other equipment out from under a slicked tarp awning nearby.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, if you are right, my dear fellow, and this is the place—I say, sir!” Holmes called out.</p>
			<p class="bt">The builder dropped the handles of his barrow and wiped his palms on plaster-stained corduroy trousers. His chin came up as he gave us a querying half-smile, revealing merrily disorganized teeth. “Aye?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes offered his hand in the open, genial manner he always assumes with strangers who might be possessed of valuable information. “A very good day to you! My friend and I are merchants from the city—we’ve a partnership in a luggage shop and business of late has been gratifyingly steady, you understand? In an effort to absorb all the intricacies of our enterprise, we’ve decided to approach a few tanneries and learn more about the process in the interests of quality control.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Have y’now?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We wish to take a scientific approach.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Pretty foul afternoon you lot are in for,” the laborer answered doubtfully.</p>
			<p class="bt">“We are men of strong stomachs with a professional stake in the matter. Though I thank you for your concern. There are tanning facilities hereabouts, we understand?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not so very many, but aye.” The affable chap rubbed at his bristling chin. “Just over that rise yonder is a road that passes two tanneries a mile or so off. Then again, to the west of us by the post road there’s a few more. Head in either direction and offer a little something for their trouble, and you should get what you’re after.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thank you very much indeed for your help.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just follow your nose.” He lifted the handles of his barrow, grinning with a backward glance.</p>
			<p class="bt">My comrade strode off with a purpose, and I hastened to keep pace with him. Though we had been given two choices of compass direction, he directed our steps with vigor toward the north, and we soon began to climb the gentle slope of a hill dotted with darkly whispering oaks. I had begun to feel the French sensation that I was repeating an experience before I understood that I was only recalling the facts of the case, as indeed Holmes was.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are thinking of the lightning-scarred tree,” I surmised.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Excellent, Watson. While that landmark could prove to be anywhere, it hints at elevation, and even a hint in this instance is better than nothing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Not long after we had quit the town proper, the houses grew widely scattered. My friend has no great affection for the countryside, and while I cannot agree with him that secret depravities lurk within every isolated homestead, I admit that on this occasion the emptiness of the place—dark branches glistening with rain, sharp-edged grasses gleaming knifelike along the road’s edges—oppressed my spirits. The thin keening of the wind was the only sound save for our own brisk footsteps.</p>
			<p class="bt">We had walked for nearly a mile, passing fewer and fewer residences, when a whiff of something rancid met my nose. My friend, no doubt, had already identified the aroma.</p>
			<p class="bt">“We’re quite close, I think. Holmes, what’s the matter?”</p>
			<p class="bt">The detective stopped, his posture as alert as that of a thoroughbred at the starting gate. To our left were fields; to our right was a walled estate with a gravel drive and a tall, decorative iron fence discouraging any visitors by means of a large padlock. Approaching the gate, Holmes reached out and drew his fingers lightly down one of the bars.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This house is all wrong,” said he.</p>
			<p class="bt">He was correct, although I did not yet know why. Something about the structure was unnerving, like hearing a stealthy footstep when one had imagined oneself alone. I joined him, staring through the gaps in the ornate metal fence. What was visible seemed a pleasant enough dwelling constructed of stately stone in a modern style, with drenched ivy clambering up the walls and the shutters of the many windows pulled tight against the rain.</p>
			<p class="bt">Then, with a start, I spied an elderly plane tree; a raw wound as if marking a blow from a fiery ax marred its mottled trunk, the unlucky branch long since carted away.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, surely this is the place!” I hissed. “But what do you mean when you say that it’s wrong?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I mean that nothing about it makes sense. Why build a new house on the outskirts of town, in an atmosphere ruined by tanneries? Apart from that, the precautionary spikes atop this fencing are most disturbing.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Are they?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes. They face inward. What does that suggest to you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My God. That they are designed for keeping residents in rather than intruders out?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can see no other logical explanation.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I spied a few feet away from us a plaque in the stone wall next to the iron gate. The engraved letters read <span class="charoverride3">Dr. Henry Staunton’s Private Rest Home for Ladies</span>.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This is an institution for the mentally ill,” I breathed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Which is in appearance entirely respectable, but constructed on property that in every way discourages casual visitation.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The look of disquiet that shot between us sent my pulse charging through my veins. An instant later, Holmes had stepped onto one of the crossbars of the locked gate. Using his wiry grip to pull himself upward, he stepped carefully onto my shoulder where I had braced myself against the stone. Once seated upon the wall’s apex, he steadied himself with one hand gripping the nearest macabre iron spike, and managed with his fist closed around my forearm and one or two toeholds in the eroding stone to pull me up after him. We landed on the opposite side, breathing hard and brushing the grit from our fingers.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tradesmen’s entrances are never locked during daylight,” Holmes declared. “Quickly!”</p>
			<p class="bt">As we sprinted across the grounds, I saw my friend making note of the relative position of the sun in the sky and the lightning-ravaged tree and knew that he was mapping the interior of the house in his mind, the spatial relations that would help us to find our mysterious correspondent before the alarm could be raised. Though Holmes was correct about the door in the rear being open, as we passed through the kitchens a surly-seeming creature with tangled blond hair and a stained apron cried out at us to stop.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What on earth do ye mean by this?” the crone shrieked. “Who are ye to barge in and—”</p>
			<p class="bt">Neither of us heeded her. A wide, shadow-shrouded staircase flew past us, then a murky passage, then another, like the twists and turns of a maze, and despite the fact we had never set foot in the place, my friend never wavered in his course.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You know where we’re going?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The second floor,” he replied, “for at this distance the incomplete tower would not otherwise be visible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Finally we reached a long hallway papered in a twining beige leaf pattern that had faded and peeled so badly it looked as if winter itself had ravaged the flora. Holmes strode to the end of the corridor and set his long fingers on a doorknob. Finding the door locked, he dropped to one knee and produced his pocketknife, opening a slender blade. Within seconds, he had picked the lock and we had pushed our way into the room.</p>
			<p class="bt">An emaciated lady, deathly still, lay upon a bed beneath a shuttered window which sent cool bars of grey<span class="charoverride11"> </span>light across her wasted countenance. Though I could see but poorly in the gloom, I noted at once that her hair was black as onyx, the color identical to the lock trapped within the memento mori in Holmes’s coat pocket.</p>
			<p class="bt">I know my role at such times and hastened to her bedside. She had once been a lovely woman, with very slender lips and a high, thoughtful brow—but her cheeks seemed flushed with fever and the edges of her mouth were cracked and peeling. When her eyes flicked open at my touch on her heated skin, I found them a startling shade of pale green. Her hand clutched at mine and I gently disengaged it, instead pressing my fingers to her wrist. Her pulse was as frantic and fluttering as the wing of a moth.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It isn’t helping,” she moaned in a paper-thin voice. “Please don’t make me stay here. I can’t bear it any longer. I’ll swear upon a Bible it isn’t helping.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What isn’t helping, miss?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The treatment,” she gasped, shuddering. “The doctor won’t <span class="charoverride3">listen.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There, there. It’s all right now—my name is Dr. John Watson, and I vow that we won’t let anyone harm you further. Tell me what he has given you, if you are able.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t know. Some sort of potion. It looked like drops of silver.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s piercing voice came from behind my shoulder. “Mercury poisoning, would you not agree, Doctor?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Almost certainly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Will she be all right?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can’t yet—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What the <span class="charoverride3">devil </span>is going on here?” a masterful voice thundered.</p>
			<p class="bt">The afflicted woman in the bed shied away in fright as I instinctually flung an arm between her body and the intruder. Filling the doorway was a stoop-shouldered gentleman of about fifty years, with a boldly rectangular face and a sneer of outrage on his lips. Though his tailored clothing and neatly brushed brown beard were the height of respectability, there was a look of almost reptilian cold-bloodedness in his flashing eyes.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dr. Henry Staunton, I presume.” Holmes confronted him. “Your churlishness is misplaced—we were summoned. This woman is a client of mine.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A client?” Dr. Staunton scoffed. “Impossible! You will both cease alarming my charge and remove yourself from my property or I shall summon the police forthwith.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By all means,” said I, carefully producing my revolver and turning so that the quivering lady should not see it. “Please summon the police.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“God in heaven! What sort of housebreakers are you, to barrel in at gunpoint and bully my patients?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and he is not bullying her.” Holmes revealed a gun of his own. “I would venture to say he may in fact be saving her life. Now, Watson, I can think of no finer course of action than to follow Dr. Staunton’s admirable advice, and to send for some stout local constabulary.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Preposterous!” Dr. Staunton bellowed. “This is a private institution. I’ll set the dogs on you first!”</p>
			<p class="bt">Our client screamed, shrinking farther against the wall in terror. I was on my feet by this time. “You’ll do no such thing. Holmes, where are we to put him?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Worry not, Watson. I’ve every intention of locking both him and his staff in their cellar,” Holmes said frigidly. “With tremendous pleasure.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Little remains to tell of what I would recall as one of the most macabre cases Holmes and I were ever prevailed upon to solve—and the second of a grim pair taking place in the quiet town of Croydon. We lost no time in imprisoning the doctor and his four nurses, which would have been a daunting task save for the fact that bullets are very effective arguments. While I tended to the lady and looked into the state of the other inmates, Holmes himself ran for the stables, saddled a mount, and had soon fetched a set of burly policemen.</p>
			<p class="bt">It was what happened next that I hate to think upon. Alongside the officers, we discovered overwhelming evidence of the most grotesque experimentation upon Dr. Henry Staunton’s subjects. Ice baths, electricity, starvation, isolation, various hysteria remedies too foul to name—apparently, no atrocity was considered too outlandish to attempt in the name of progress. Never shall I forget the sight of his “treatment room,” a chamber of horrors better resembling a feudal dungeon than a haven of healing, and one which the official force quit in revulsion after less than five minutes’ perusal. My friend and I remained, shaken beyond our worst expectations.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The depths to which human depravity can sink will never cease to confound me.” Holmes’s face was rigid with disgust as we gazed at a wall of instruments I did not even attempt to identify. “What are we to make of the species in light of this room? Where is progress, where is logic, where is reason itself, when a savage smashing his comrade’s skull with a rock would be kinder treatment of the race? I ask you, what is the limit to our perversion?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It doesn’t bear thinking on,” I agreed, overwhelmed by the evil surrounding us.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hell is empty,” Holmes concluded under his breath, “and all the devils are here.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Stricken, I pressed his still too-thin arm in reassurance. “Some of the angels are too, my dear fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He dropped a set of forceps back upon a tabletop, his jaw set stonily. “Not enough of them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, there I will not contradict you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What is the solution, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have no answer. I don’t know that anyone does, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When my friend’s eyes snagged upon the sort of sewing needle which ought to have been found at the nearby tannery and instead was set in a case alongside others like it, he froze with such a look of valiantly restrained anguish that I instantly steered him straight out of the room. My never having seen the expression before, it startled me deeply. The mere fact that he allowed me the liberty of propelling him away, when ordinarily I am ever the one who follows his lead, told me with what graphic colors his imagination was painting possibilities from the data at hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">Planting his back against the wall in the corridor, I admonished him, “All right, that’s enough, don’t you agree?”</p>
			<p class="bt">My friend’s shoulders could have been carved from granite, but his face was now slack and neutral enough to cause the gravest alarm. That his time abroad had been more nightmare than holiday I had already deduced from the obvious physical signs, but to see the ruthless mastery of his mind so adversely affected confirmed my worst fears. I wondered with a sharp ache in my chest—and always shall wonder, I believe—what terrors I missed when I could have been of service, even if only to the smallest degree.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes,” I insisted, giving him a shake, “you’re conducting a fruitless and damaging exercise, and I won’t have it. Are you listening to me? Holmes, <span class="charoverride3">stop.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I raised my voice, he came back to himself with a tiny shudder. I let him go, studying him carefully. Raising his hands to his brow and brushing his closed eyelids with his thumbs, he breathed several times before saying, “That was—for a moment, I . . .”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, take your time. Slowly. There, that’s right.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My sincerest apologies for that appalling display.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He laughed silently, though I could detect no mirth in the expression. Patiently I waited as horror ebbed and calm settled into its void. Less than ten seconds later, he had pushed himself upright and was distantly ironical again.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, if anyone is going to watch me being ridiculous, then thank God it’s you. I know I was vexing you earlier, but I appreciate your accompanying me this afternoon,” he added crisply. “I suspect that it should not have been very tolerable otherwise.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear chap, no matter how much pressure I am presently under, you must know that nothing better pleases me than watching you bring light where all is darkness.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nonsense. I should never have found the place at all if not for you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, you have said before that a trusty companion is sometimes of use.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Always,” he corrected me with an unreadable look. “You misquote me dreadfully. Always of use.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And I am doubly glad to have been so on this occasion. You had better question Miss Rorden before the police monopolize her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dear me, is that my client’s name? I am clearly quite incapable without you,” he joked, quirking a somber smile.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, Miss Emilia Rorden. And you were preoccupied with herding a pack of villains into a root cellar.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I confess that even given the shameful treatment she has suffered, I am eager to speak with her. Despite her weakened condition, she is obviously a highly resourceful young lady. Come to that, is she strong enough?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Go gently with her, but I believe so. I’ve given her a mild sedative, and yarrow tea with a cold water bottle for the fever. None of the other women here are at all healthy, but they aren’t presently in any severe danger either, and we’ve summoned an ambulance. Lead the way, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When we had regained Miss Rorden’s sickroom, I saw that my immediate measures had taken some effect, though whether her constitution could ever fully recover from mercury poisoning was beyond my control. Holmes pulled a chair up to her bedside, saying, “You have been much tried already, Miss Rorden, but I beg leave to speak with you for a few minutes before we take you away from this terrible place.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Miss Rorden’s hair gushed over the pillow in a tangled black cascade like a spill of creosote; her chiseled features were still both wan and fevered above the rubber bag I had filled with ice and placed beneath her pillow. But her green eyes were clear as tinted glass now and she nodded, weakly taking the hand my friend proffered her.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you know how you came to be here?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I suffer from epilepsy, Mr. Holmes,” she whispered as strongly as she could. “The fits are not severe, but they are frequent. They were a burden to my family, not to mention a public disgrace on more than one occasion. Eventually my parents despaired of curing me by conventional means and sent me to the only specialist they could afford. In my feverish state when I wrote to you, I had forgotten his name, recalling only certain tokens by which you might know my whereabouts.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Henry Staunton. He will trouble you no further, I promise that, Miss Rorden. Go on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I fear we have all been the victims of the vilest quackery imaginable. The lengths he went to, the torments he devised—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“We know of them already and you need not burden yourself with that part of the account today,” Holmes interrupted gently.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thank God. I am one of the lucky ones, I know it, to be merely subjected to slow poisoning. Thinking about what some of the others went through . . . oh, it’s unbearable. In any case, I fear that our mortality rate here has reflected the care Dr. Staunton takes with his patients, which soon revealed a bizarre quirk of his nature to us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And this was?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whenever one of us seemed likely to expire from the ill-use, he would ask which of our loved ones we cared for the most and bring a memento mori to the deathbed, requesting a lock of hair. There was always a gleam in his eye when he did so—not of sympathy, or even apathy, but of pleasure. It was . . . monstrously cruel, Mr. Holmes, to treat the expiring as if they were some sort of prize. He must have collected a dozen such remembrances, always carefully addressing the package in his own hand and assuring whoever stood at death’s door that, though she was likely to have passed away by the time it arrived at its destination, nevertheless her kin would always treasure this final gift from her.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Trophies,” my friend mused in quiet revulsion. “Possibly he also kept locks for himself postmortem; possibly the ceremony was enough to satisfy him. You say that he would actually send these tokens to your parents? Your husbands?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whomever we most urgently wished to bid farewell to, yes. But it was obvious that the true joy he derived was from the added mental torment of our realizing the end had come—of tearing us away from our last shred of hope. No one escaped this ritual. He would snip a lock, we would indicate a recipient, and we knew we were done for. After a very short interim, his latest victim would be in the ground.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dear God, he’s entirely mad,” I breathed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Very probably madness, at the least virulent sadism, or a combination of the two.” Holmes spoke in a mellow tone so as not to further upset the lady, but I needed nothing more than his ramrod posture to know that Dr. Staunton’s days on earth were numbered.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Three of the four nurses here are as vile as the doctor, but one is merely plodding and stupid,” Miss Rorden continued. “After I was subjected to the ceremony of consigning a lock of my hair to its case, and he had prepared it for posting, I remembered your name from <span class="charoverride3">The</span> <span class="charoverride3">Strand</span>, Mr. Holmes, and where you reside. I had a vague recollection of the impossible feats you were said to accomplish, had hazy visions of you finding and saving me. My only chance at survival seemed to be smuggling you a message, however slender the chance it would arrive safely. When next I saw the nurse who is more witless than cruel, I convinced her in great desperation that my remembrance to my family had been misaddressed, that I had made an error in telling the doctor where it ought to be delivered, and that she <span class="charoverride3">must</span> bring me pen and paper. When I think of what Dr. Staunton would have done had he found out my ploy! We spirited all away under a staircase where I wrote to you by candlelight, Mr. Holmes—it must have been delirious, barely legible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was brilliantly thought of and courageously executed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There was no way for me to know that it would go out with the morning post, but it must have, oh it must have, for you are here,” she concluded on a sob, and he tightened his grip on her hand. “He would have killed me within a day or two. Dear God, to think of it! He has killed so many of us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Seeing that the interview could go no further, we soothed her spirits and I administered another round of compresses, which further reduced her temperature and soon found her drifting in a troubled but genuine sleep. Thus were all Holmes’s deductions confirmed, and I am flattered to say that while my never very humble friend could have taken the credit, he ever afterward would admit only to having “helped to hang” the infamous Henry Staunton, as I myself had identified the crucial clock tower.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sitting across from each other in the train returning to London upon the late evening in question, the women Staunton had abused so shamefully having been rushed to the nearest hospital, we both regained our energies and spirits somewhat. Holmes, however—though revived—seemed distinctly ill at ease. During one stretch of countryside, in fact, he appeared for some twenty minutes to be upon the verge of speech. My friend was never one to mince words, so I waited in baffled silence as he fidgeted.</p>
			<p class="bt">When at last Holmes did give way to utterance, he announced imperiously, “You ought to sell it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Having never seen Holmes look so aloof and so apprehensive simultaneously, I took a long moment to study him. “And what am I selling?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Your practice, of course.”</p>
			<p class="bt">At times, friendship with Sherlock Holmes is an easy matter of shared concerts, quiet suppers, and the ever-present chance of witnessing his remarkable intellect blazing to life over a conundrum worthy of his artistry. At others, such as the moment to which I refer, his assumed authority can be just a trifle vexing even to men who habitually charge themselves to keep their tempers.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Indeed. How do you propose I live, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Howsoever you please, so long as it’s at Baker Street. It is most inconvenient for me to travel so far every time I am in need of your assistance.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When my mouth opened upon a truly tart reply, he held up a hand in a far more placating manner. “No, please hear me out.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I really don’t see why I ought to, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A profession is only as valuable as it makes a man feel, my dear fellow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So you propose that I discard mine?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’re a writer.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Such a wealth of conflicting feeling assaulted me that I could only retort icily, “You mean <span class="charoverride3">biographer.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">Silence flooded the train car, a silence in which I took a certain harsh satisfaction.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And what if I do?” he asked, looking for an instant almost frightened.</p>
			<p class="bt">“A poor one, as you have said repeatedly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As I regret. When I came back, and required aid in besting Colonel Moran, I could turn to no one else, nor did I desire to do so. I needed you, and you said, ‘where you like and when you like.’ ” Holmes paused, passing a knuckle over his lips briefly. “I had not expected that. Only hoped it. I owe you more than a set of rooms.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My face turned to the window. The tree line blurred as I thought of my combined home and practice and all that had taken place within its walls. Of the laughter, and the shared silences, and of the memento mori of my late wife’s flaxen hair hidden in my bedside table, and of the note I yet retained that ended, <span class="charoverride3">“Believe me to be, my dear fellow, very sincerely yours, Sherlock Holmes.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt">“You said in my consulting room dressed as the old bookseller that several times during the last three years, you have taken up your pen to write to me,” I remarked when I could speak normally.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes.” Holmes’s voice was faintly strained, and though I have never once desired to hurt him, I was perversely glad of it.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What did you wish to say?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t follow you, Doctor.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“When you took up your pen, what would you have written? Now I am here, you see, and you aren’t dead after all, so you can simply tell me. Would it have been merely terse notice that you continued breathing, or would you have included commentary upon the weather in Tibet? Updates regarding your success in researching coal-tar derivatives, perhaps? A colorful portrait of the Khalifa would have proved a most welcome diversion.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, please don’t.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Fine, as you wish—I should never dream of forcing your confidence. How many times?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear fellow—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How many times is <span class="charoverride3">several,</span> Holmes?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I was guilty of some slight prevarication on that subject. It was not several.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You never thought of writing me at all, then?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was <span class="charoverride3">dozens,</span>” he said fiercely. “Forty-seven that I can recall specifically, when I actually went so far as to lift a writing implement and set it down again for caution’s sake, and every day for three years in the more general sense. I am machinelike, yes, and I am unfeeling, demonstrably, but I am not stupid; I am something of an expert where John Watson is concerned, and I have never in my life gained any pleasure by inflicting pain on the undeserving. What do you take me for, a foul creature along the lines of Dr. Staunton? If so, why should you have suffered my company for this long? No one else on earth has the slightest desire to, after all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sighing, I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes. “I do not <span class="charoverride3">suffer</span> your company, Holmes. And I ought not to have asked about the letters when I knew it would distress you. That was very unworthy of me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No it wasn’t. It was a perfectly fair question.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nevertheless.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“So to continue on the topic of the day I returned, as that seems to be what you desire to discuss, I told you that I had wished to write to you, and could not. I also told you that I found myself in my old armchair in my old room, and wishing only that I could have seen my old friend in the other chair. Unsurprisingly, I seem to wish the identical thing whenever you are not present, and so I’ll ask you plainly: come back to Baker Street.” He paused, eyes determinedly fixed upon his knee. “Implying it would be for your sake was not untrue, but it was partial. You would do better to leave your house and practice, and I would do better to see your chair occupied in a more permanent fashion. I said that I owed you a thousand apologies—allow this to be my first. Please. Say <span class="charoverride3">yes</span> at any moment and I give you my word I’ll stop talking.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Chuckling helplessly, I dropped my head back against the seat cushion. As was so often the case, seconds before I had been furious with my friend, and now I could think of him only as the most marvelously strange fellow it had ever been my good fortune to meet. Returning to Baker Street, I thought, would be financially prudent, mentally stimulating, and occasionally maddening. It would be sublime.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll think about it,” I told him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But we—”</p>
			<p class="bt"><span class="charoverride3">“Holmes.”</span></p>
			<p class="bt">My friend wisely subsided, and pulled out a pair of cigarettes, and we spent the remainder of the journey quietly smoking. I did think about it, as I had promised him. And before the month was out, the furniture van pulled up to my door.</p>
