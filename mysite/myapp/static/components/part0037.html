				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Colonel Morris looked on in horror as his battalion went to ground. He was at the centre of the fusiliers’ ranks, not that the line truly existed any more. Behind him the young faces of the ensigns carrying the colours were ashen-white, terror bright in their eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"> Bodies lay on the ground, the twisted corpses of men who had been under his command abandoned amidst the ruin of the vineyard. He saw the tremor in the fusiliers’ ranks as they began to shuffle backwards.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Morris refused to let his battalion retreat. Even if it led to their destruction, the fusiliers would advance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘King’s Royal Fusiliers will advance!’ he screamed, demanding his men respond. They ignored him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘King’s Royal Fusiliers!’ Morris stood tall in his stirrups. Fear twisted inside him as he made himself an obvious target. ‘Advance!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Colonel Morris stared at his men, unable to believe they were stubbornly refusing to obey. The shame of retreat was more than he could stand. He felt tears of impotence prick at his eyelids. Then a single officer broke from the tattered ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Captain Sloames, the commander of the Light Company, burst from the midst of his fusiliers. His mouth was wide open, bellowing for his men to follow but Morris was too far away to hear the words. He watched mesmerised as Sloames turned on the open ground to face the cowering redcoats and berate them. Morris could see the fear on the officer’s face, saw him flinch as bullets whipped past. Then he raced across the open ground and into the river.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">And the fusiliers followed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They stormed from the pathetic remains of the vineyard, charging like a huge red herd. Morris felt a surge of pride as he watched his men follow the example set by the insane bravery of one officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Dozens were struck, their bodies thrown violently to the ground. The enemy fire simply could not miss. But the redcoats ignored their casualties and kept going.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Morris urged his horse forward to join the pack of redcoats churning the riverbank into a muddy slick. He tried to shout across to Captain Sloames but his words were lost in the noise of the melee. He wanted to convey his thanks but his view of the Light Company’s commander was blocked by another mounted figure who was pushing his way through the muddled ranks of redcoats to reach the shelf screening the men from the worst of the enemy fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good show, Morris! Let’s get on with it, shall we?’ General Codrington spurred past him. Quite what his brigade commander hoped to achieve in the midst of the broken ranks was beyond Morris’s comprehension but he urged his own horse forward and followed his general.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The redcoats greeted the appearance of their brigade commander with a huge cheer. Codrington let his willing horse pick its way up the far bank before he turned in the saddle, sweeping his old-fashioned bicorn hat from his head in a grand theatrical gesture.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Come on, Fusiliers! Advance!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The redcoats bellowed their approval. They stormed out of the shelter of the Alma, scrambling up the greasy riverbank so they could begin the advance up the pristine slope that led to the great redoubt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To the right of Morris’s battalion, the 7th Fusiliers scrambled out of the river, led by Colonel Lacy Yea.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Never mind forming up!’ he yelled, waving his sword. ‘Come on, men! Come on!’ His fusiliers responded.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The battalions of Codrington’s brigade left the river and followed their officers up the slope towards the heart of the Russian position.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack elbowed his way towards the front of his company, ignoring the loud protests of the men he shoved out of the way. His feet squelched in his boots, his lower body was wet and chilled but the petty discomfort was easily ignored. Nothing was of any consequence aside from his determination to lead his company from the front.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was close to breaking free from the crowd of fusiliers when the redcoat directly in front of him was hit. The power of the bullet’s impact knocked the fusilier backwards, his hands clutching at the ruin of his face. Jack recoiled as the soldier reeled back against him, the redcoat’s body twisted in agony, his scream of anguish cut off with a sickening gurgle as a wash of blood filled his throat. In his horror, Jack shoved the wounded man cruelly to one side, and he fell to the ground. The advance pressed on. The unfeeling boots of the wounded man’s fellow redcoats thumped into his body, their oaths and curses at the obstacle the last sounds the dying redcoat would ever hear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The air was alive with rifle bullets. At the head of his company Jack flinched uncontrollably as the shot flickered past him, his ears full of the cries of pain that followed the sickening sound of the bullets hitting living flesh. He kept his eyes fixed on the wooden walls of the great redoubt, trying to shut out the horror that was all around him, his body quivering with barely controlled terror.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In front of the battalion, Jack could see Colonel Morris urging his powerful horse up the slope. Morris was close to fifty yards ahead of the fusiliers, when he suddenly rose up in his stirrups. At first, Jack thought the colonel was standing tall in the saddle to cheer his men on. To his horror, Morris kept moving, arching backwards before tumbling out of the saddle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">When Jack reached him the colonel was lying stretched out on the ground, his body twisted like a rag doll. In front of Jack’s horrified gaze Morris’s body twitched where it lay, jerking like a landed fish as more Russian bullets slammed mercilessly into his prostrate body. Jack did not need to look at the blood pooling around the body to know the colonel was dead.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text"> Far up the slope, the Russian skirmishers fired for a final time before they withdrew, disappearing out of sight over the crest of the slope. The air was suddenly still and Jack tore his gaze from his colonel’s lifeless body to stare in bewilderment at the Russians’ sudden withdrawal. The ridge was clear of enemy soldiers, the path to the great redoubt inviting and open. The fusilier behind Jack pushed him hard in his back, impatient at his dawdling, unceremoniously thumping his officer forward. The jarring blow to his back sent a spasm of pain surging up his spine but it brought him to his senses.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The time to mourn Colonel Morris’s passing would come later. Right now, those officers left standing had to lead the men forward, to inspire them to victory.</p>
