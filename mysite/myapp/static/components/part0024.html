				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The new arrivals trudged in late that afternoon. The battalion had spent another laborious day organising the mountain of supplies that continued to be brought ashore. Hour after back-breaking hour was spent moving the tons of supplies the army would need if it were to untie itself from the apron strings of the navy and strike inland.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The arrival of new men would usually have brought the battalion to its feet to scrutinise the newcomers and subject them to a barrage of catcalls and insults. Today was different, the fusiliers were simply too exhausted after their day of labour to show much interest in their reinforcements.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The newcomers, too, were in a wretched condition after weeks of being incarcerated on the transport ships. Many were raw recruits, naïve impressionable young men who had fallen for the blarney of the recruiting parties or were desperate to escape poverty, using the army as a refuge and a better alternative to the grinding misery of the workhouse. Most would have joined up in London, the fusiliers’ traditional recruiting ground where all manner of Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen and the Irish could be found. A rare few would already be soldiers, volunteers from the regiment’s depot companies, who were drawn to the campaign to escape the mind-numbing boredom of garrison life.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The new recruits would also include a substantial number of felons who had been given the option to serve the Queen. The authorities were always willing to empty the dregs from London’s gaols into the ranks rather than go through the lengthy process and costs of a formal trial. The army took them willingly, its insatiable appetite for manpower overriding any qualms about arming the country’s criminal classes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The battalion would have to absorb these newcomers, embrace and train them, turning them from ordinary redcoats into fusiliers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">This motley collection of soldiers stood about waiting to be welcomed. The sky had cleared and the late-afternoon sun did nothing to improve their appearance. A few fusiliers looked them over, a swift appraisal that invariably finished with a snort of derision. They were outsiders, foot soldiers not fusiliers, therefore not worthy of consideration or attention.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Flowers bustled over to greet the bedraggled replacements he had left waiting for close to half an hour. The adjutant was carrying several pieces of paper that he was trying to read as he walked. He paused to finish the last sheet of paper before tucking the pile under his arm and grinning warmly at the men who had the good fortune to be joining the King’s Royal Fusiliers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good afternoon. What glorious weather! My apologies for the lack of ceremony but as I’m sure you can imagine things are a little busy around here at the moment. Now then, I’ll not detain you for long. We’ll soon have you away to join your companies.’ Flowers noticed the enormous sergeant who stood alone at the head of the column. ‘Goodness me. Welcome, Sergeant. You’ll be pleased to hear you are assigned to the Light Company. The best of the best for you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The sergeant snapped to attention. ‘Sir!’ He was a bear of a man who would surely command the immediate respect of his new company. Flowers was certain Captain Sloames would count himself very fortunate indeed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The lieutenant’s attention was diverted for a moment by the sight of a most welcome surprise hidden at the rear of the column. Standing forlornly behind the formed ranks was a single horse and cart. Battered and broken, both had almost certainly seen better days and looked thoroughly clapped out. Nevertheless, Flowers was too delighted by the cart’s contents to worry about its condition.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘God bless you! Tents! It’s about time they turned up.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He immediately summoned the closest company to unload the cart’s precious contents and haul the stone-coloured canvas sacks to where the rest of the battalion’s stores were piled up. It was immediately obvious that there would not be enough of the large and cumbersome bell tents to go round but on first inspection there appeared to be enough to get most of the battalion’s officers under canvas even if it meant some very cosy sleeping arrangements. The subalterns and the fusiliers would not be so lucky and would be forced to continue enduring whatever weather the Crimean peninsula chose to inflict upon them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With the unloading of the cart well under way Flowers was pleased to spy the regimental sergeant major leading a gaggle of sergeants and corporals towards the sullen ranks of newcomers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Flowers supervised the distribution of the reinforcements, handling the process briskly and efficiently, allocating the new arrivals to their allotted companies and into the care of the sergeants and corporals. Soon, only the new sergeant was left, along with the six men who would join him in the ranks. Sergeants Adams and Shepherd from the Light Company eyed the imposing figure of their new sergeant warily.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Right,’ announced Flowers cheerfully. ‘I’ll escort you chaps to your new company personally. Follow me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Flowers found Captain Sloames perched on the edge of a crate of ammunition, his feet stretched out lazily in from of him while he cleaned his fingernails with the end of a tortoiseshell comb. His shako lay discarded on the ground beside him and for the first time the weather was clement enough for him to have removed his mud-encrusted greatcoat, which was draped over a stand of rifles in a vain attempt to dry it out.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The captain’s dress uniform showed the ravages of days spent in the field. The dress jacket was splattered with grime, the vibrant scarlet already dulled, and the bullion epaulettes and fine brass buttons were tarnished, and flecked with dirt. The uniform was slowly degrading in the harsh climate, much like the man who hid beneath its folds.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked up as Flowers led his little procession towards him, casually tossing his tortoiseshell comb into his upturned shako as he stood to greet them. He had used the afternoon’s decent weather to shave off his beard, something he never enjoyed doing. His skin was red and sore from the razor’s abrasive attention and a few spots of blood welled up under his jaw line. At least the razor’s blunt service had distracted him from fretting over whether or not he would obtain the service of a new sergeant. Now that concern came back and Jack anxiously scanned the approaching men.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With relief he caught a glimpse of white sergeant’s chevrons on the arm of the man following behind Lieutenant Flowers. Jack smiled warmly and was about to offer his most profuse thanks to Lieutenant Flowers when his smile died and his body went rigid. Fear and loathing coursed through him, his fingers twitched towards the revolver at his hip. Flowers was bringing to the Light Company a man who could recognise their captain for the charlatan he was.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Flowers saw the colour drain from Jack’s cheeks. ‘Captain Sloames, are you quite well?’ He moved forward and reached out to steady the visibly shaken officer in front of him, blocking the new sergeant’s view of Jack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m fine.’ Jack spoke barely above a whisper, desperately trying to gather his fleeing wits.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Are you sure? You have me quite concerned but let me try to improve your spirits. The colonel has granted your request and let you take the new sergeant. I’m sure you will find him of considerable value to your company, not least because the man is a damned Goliath.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Flowers turned to one side and held his arm out to bring the replacement sergeant into the conversation. The towering soldier took a purposeful step forward and stood rigidly to attention in front of his new commanding officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack stood face to face with the man he hated more than any other. His mind was racing, his memory replaying that brutal fight in the laundry. He could remember every bitter moment of it and now the cause of all his misery stood in front of him, about to reveal his true identity.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater was staring straight ahead, his gaze focused on a spot six inches above Jack’s forehead. It took several agonising moments before the sergeant sensed that his new officer was waiting for his attention.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Slater finally lowered his gaze. Jack saw the flare of recognition deep in the dark brown eyes. But the moment passed and Slater’s gaze returned to its original position. He stood rigidly at attention, his pose the very embodiment of a British sergeant waiting for a command.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Right, I’ll leave you to it.’ Lieutenant Flowers playfully punched Captain Sloames on the shoulder. ‘Are you sure you are quite well? The last thing we need is you falling sick. There has been quite enough of that sort of thing already.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, Flowers, you may go.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There were a thousand questions running through Jack’s mind as he struggled to understand how the brutal sergeant had arrived in the Crimea.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There were many questions but just a single conclusion. His charade was over.</p>
