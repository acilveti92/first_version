			<p class="bt-1st-para3">Mr. Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street, and I myself when in his estimable company, has been accosted by so many strange individuals that to list them would prove a task too Herculean for even the most dedicated biographer. The subject of operatic introductions indeed cannot even be called to my mind without a veritable eccentrics’ menagerie flooding it. We had sat and listened to numberless wild appeals, impossible assertions, and nightmarish accounts, so many that during our busiest periods I wondered at the city of London itself—whether any other metropolis upon this colossal globe harbored such an array of skulking villains, and whether any other citizenry was so bedeviled by the goblins (all too human in nature) who lurked in its treetops and paving stones. Few other examples exhibit such an alarming commencement, however, as that of Mr. Horatio Falconer, whose introduction to our lives I still recall with a creeping chill.</p>
			<p class="bt">The year was 1900, the November night a torrential one, lashing down sleet as if determined to drive out all inhabitants, saint and sinner alike, and begin afresh. I have mentioned before that, like any man of creative temperament, Holmes reacts to the weather almost as he would to a piece of musical accompaniment designed to alter the mood of the theatregoer. Thankfully, however, instead of succumbing to the storm’s effects, my friend was engaged upon an eighteenth-century legal letter purporting to have been written by the estate’s “ballivus,” a man who served as a manorial lord’s liaison with the reeve. This document, if genuine, could ruin a great family while making a disreputable one wealthy beyond imagining, and he sat at his desk poring over the parchment until well after midnight.</p>
			<p class="bt">Despite being perfectly contented myself with a cigar, a glass of port, and a late edition, I had peered over his shoulder when emphatic grunts or exclamations issued. My curiosity had gained me nothing more than an indecipherable jumble of abbreviations, “VIIber” for September being the only one I could decipher, so for some twenty minutes I had left him to it. I was just beginning to nod when a sharp cry agitated the drink in my hand. I was on my feet instantly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good Lord, Holmes, what’s the matter?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nothing whatever, my good man!” Whipping his head in my direction, he brandished the letter with far less care than he had previously used upon the delicate artifact, his torso fairly wriggling with restrained glee. “The Gascoyne family is quite safe from harm and I shall wire them on the morrow. The matter is settled.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear fellow!” I gasped. “You are to be congratulated. But how did—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“This paper represents one of the most unusual attempts at chicanery I’ve ever been privileged to witness. But it is without doubt a forgery. See here—no, you needn’t worry over touching it; the clever rogues must have found an antique stock of parchment abandoned somewhere or other and experienced a malicious flash of inspiration. As I told you, the ink holds up under scrutiny and the penmanship is likewise masterly. But the historic word for a last will declared orally rather than written out is ‘nuncupative,’ and as you will astutely note, here they have used ‘testamentary’ owing to ignorance of antique legal terminology. There were five other indications which nagged at me terribly, but were too minor to send the interlopers packing. Thanks to this error in vocabulary, however, the Gascoynes can go on living as they always have lived—which I need not tell you will doubtless save the youngest daughter’s engagement. Rather neatly managed, don’t you think?”</p>
			<p class="bt">So saying, Holmes released the forged document, allowing it to flutter to the floor. He crossed his arms and regarded me with the look of pure joy only evident when he has just exercised his formidable powers for justice, and before a trusted audience.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Bravo!” I exclaimed readily, wringing his hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">In the midst of a radiant grin, he yawned, and his glittering eyes drifted to the page now lying in disgrace upon our hearth rug. “That was a triumph of dedication over inclination near the end, Watson. I’ve a ghastly headache.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t doubt it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You weren’t present, but the Gascoyne patriarch was beside himself when he came to me, and small wonder, with his daughter’s future prospects teetering upon the brink of imminent ruin. Frankly, I’ve better use for men who live by their wits or their sweat than for men who live by their pedigree, but it is pleasant to think that the innocent need not suffer from an opportunistic ruse.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hear, hear.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Still.” He shifted, one finger tapping against his long chin. “As a fellow professional in the field, I doff my cap to them, considering how much inventiveness, expertise, and daring this involved. The perpetrators were described to me as an impoverished family from a university town whose breadwinner had lost his position. This scheme is so outlandish that it would have worked in all likelihood, if not for me—a beautiful blend of craft and art, truly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’re a professional in the field of skullduggery, are you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">His mouth twitched with merriment. “You’ll admit that I’d be unmatched.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Shaking my head, I had turned away with the intention of fetching Holmes a headache powder from my bag when we heard a violent assault upon the downstairs bell, followed by equally brutish treatment of the door in the form of desperate pounding.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes rubbed at his temples in pain. “Dear me. That is either someone come to take the house by force of arms at the midnight hour, in which case we should have to do battle with him, or someone who desperately desires us to wet our boots. Regarding either scenario, I am reluctant to—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll bring you something for your head in a moment,” I assured him, hastening toward the staircase whilst blessing Providence that Mrs. Hudson was from home tending to an ailing relation.</p>
			<p class="bt">As a medical man, and one who has long lived within the sphere of a finely honed scientific mind to boot, I cannot say that I endorse the existence of spirits who meddle in the affairs of men: so I do not believe in supernatural portents, no matter how clear they may seem to some. And yet, there is such a thing as common intuition, and mine that night pulsed with alarm at the cacophony upon our front step.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do have a care, Watson,” I heard, and I glanced back to see that Holmes had appeared behind the banister rail with dressing gown hem fluttering, doubtless for the same reason my muscles were taut with alarm.</p>
			<p class="bt">I released the lock and turned the handle, but before I could move back to allow our visitor entrance, a savage shape half-hurtled and half-pushed its way through the door. Thrown off balance, I glimpsed what seemed a bundle of rags with a revolver in its hands flying up the stairs two at a time.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, he’s armed!” I shouted, lunging in pursuit.</p>
			<p class="bt">Mere seconds passed as I raced after the invader, but my heart was firing like a cannonade and my imagination was blackly poisoned with a single thought: Sherlock Holmes, of all London’s residents, received perhaps the highest number and certainly the widest variety of death threats. Dozens of miscreants had at one time or another pledged themselves to the single-minded goal of his demise. Lacking other options, I was prepared to tackle this interloper, fling him to the hardwood, and be done; but the idea that a stray bullet might find its way to my friend turned the blood in my veins as cold as the sleet now spattering our entryway.</p>
			<p class="bt">Time’s flow slowed to a trickle when I crested the final step to discover Holmes with one foot neatly behind him in a fighter’s stance, ready to dive or dodge as needs must. Before him stood a short, thick-shouldered figure with matted black hair, a streaming coat which looked as if it had been dredged straight from the Thames, and a gun clutched in one shaking hand.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ll do it,” he boomed in a resonant baritone. “I swear to God I will, and then I’ll have finished the business for good and all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You appear a trifle out of sorts, sir.” Holmes’s much higher voice was as smooth as a river stone, but I saw the way his agile fingers twitched and his eyes sent darting glances hither and thither as he tried to ascertain the wisest course. “Of course, I cannot blame you in the slightest, as no sane gentlemen cares to have wet snow poured down his collar, and I perceive you lack an umb—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Who says I’m sane?” the fellow demanded. “Who says I’m a gentleman, either?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well.” Holmes coughed politely. “I’ll admit that both sanity and gentility are nuanced questions, but I perceive you originally come from respectable stock in the neighborhood of Colchester—Lexden, to be precise—and never having met you before in my life . . .” Here my friend paused and with a look ascertained I understood we faced not an old enemy, but something more volatile still. “It is a habit of mine to give the benefit of the—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I said I’ll <span class="charoverride3">do it</span>!” the visitor cried, raising the revolver and clapping its muzzle against his own head.</p>
			<p class="bt">Horror contorted Holmes’s features as I gasped. An instant later, he had transformed himself into the snake charmer I have described elsewhere, the man who gives the distinct impression that he could walk into the middle of a frothing mob and calm its spirits with a quiet overture.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, but you can’t, you understand.” Holmes struck a lilting, conversational tone. “No, I won’t have it. See here, I think you came to Baker Street to tell me about yourself. Did you not? The only alternative explanation is that you came here so that I might witness your demise and vouch for it, which could suggest any of half a dozen motives that occur to me. But you see, I don’t know who you are, and supposing you fire that weapon . . .” He shrugged sadly. “Perhaps I never will. My friend here—just behind you, the hearty chap with the moustache—is a doctor. If something ails you, he will do all he can to help. As for myself, I am criminally curious, you know, and I cannot have gentlemen from Lexden charging into my rooms and intriguing me only to watch them expire.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I had been confused, but though Holmes’s words were glib, they were equally gentle, and already taking effect. The man appeared more cognizant of the terrible situation in which we found ourselves after hearing my friend make light of it. His trembling did not cease, however, and his rich voice when it emerged was knotted thickly with despair.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I thought perhaps that you, only you, could help me. Foolishness! No one believes me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I might surprise you. I’ve been told I’m very unpredictable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“This truly <span class="charoverride3">is</span> the guise madness takes, coming here in the middle of the night and waving a gun in front of decent people—it’s proof of everything they say! What I believe happened to me is impossible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But you see, I happen to be the world’s foremost expert on what is possible versus what is impossible. So since you’re already here, it would be a shame not to tell me about it.” Holmes offered a tiny smile.</p>
			<p class="bt">The poor fellow laughed and then collapsed to the floor as if someone had tossed a ragbag onto it, sobbing over and over, “God help me, God help me.” Quick as a thought, Holmes had descended to his knees, pocketed the gun, and taken him squarely by the shoulders.</p>
			<p class="bt">“All right,” he said in a much more sober tone. “You’ve taken a spell, but whatever has happened to bring you here, nothing can harm you at the moment. You understand that all you must do is calm yourself, and my friend and I shall see to the rest? Very good. Some brandy I think might be in order, and I’ll move the rack before the hearth so we can dry your coat, and we shall see what we can do.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Brandy!” the fellow repeated after another anguished sound. “God have mercy. Some bread, thank you, and a cup of tea, and I’ll do what I can to recover myself. I cannot express my shame over—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tut-tut! Not another word of that nature, provided you allow me to retain your weapon temporarily in lieu of an apology. Do you call that a fair trade? All right, then. If you can make your way into the sitting room just there, I’ll fetch the coatrack and some sandwiches. We must do for ourselves just now, as we’ve the most disloyal and frivolous landlady in Britain, who will insist on abandoning us whensoever one of her aunts is dying. It’s extremely tedious. I am Sherlock Holmes, by the way, and this is my friend, Dr. John Watson.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When our guest perceived the hand proffered, he bent over it as if it were a lifeline. “Mr. Horatio Falconer, sir, and already a man forever in your debt.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not at all. Off with you toward the fire, and we shall see to housekeeping and return in a trice.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Falconer staggered to his feet and proceeded, still weeping hard, into the sitting room. On the instant he was gone, my friend fell back on his heels, looking thoroughly spent.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens, Holmes, are you all right?” I demanded, approaching him. “That was an unprecedented performance. My dear fellow, can you stand?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course I can.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I had helped pull him to his feet, I saw in the low light of the hall that he was indeed hale enough, though far more shaken than usual following a violent altercation. I could scarce blame him, feeling identically myself.</p>
			<p class="bt">“If we never see such a display as that again, I’ll give the universe top marks.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was, as you suggest, unusual, and not in a fashion that bears repeating,” he conceded, seeming to shake the startlement from his limbs as he trotted downstairs.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, I thought he was here to enact some terrible revenge on you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, that likewise occurred to me. I saw that you were as ready as ever to fling yourself into the fray, and I humbly thank you for it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ve no need to thank me for anything, and you don’t do anything humbly.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, if that were the case, you’d have no notion of what it looks like, would you, and therefore cannot judge as to either the nature or the frequency of my humility,” he teased, seeming fully recovered as he shut the front door and locked it. “My dear Doctor, I am going to make sandwiches, a task at which I excel as I excel at so many others. I request that you carry the coatrack upstairs and fix me a headache tonic, if you would be so kind. I find myself in direst need of one.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Some ten minutes later, Holmes and I sat in our respective chairs, listening to the coat drip as it dried, my friend’s tonic swiftly dispatched, watching as our guest upon the sofa consumed his simple repast of cold beef and cheese. The interval gave us ample opportunity to observe him. Mr. Falconer seemed somewhere between the ages of forty-five and fifty-five, but his appearance made his reason for refusing brandy eminently clear. He had already been drunk when he arrived, for his movements were slow and deliberate, his craggy face was emblazoned with red veins, and his skin beneath the enlarged vessels was a sickly yellow hue. A hooked nose, tangled black hair that fell to his shoulders unrestrained, and a suit equally as decrepit as his coat completed this picture of total dissolution. His eyes within the wreckage, however, were of a clear, pale blue, and so artistic and lively despite their glassiness that I heartily pitied the fellow for having driven himself into such perilous territory as regarded his health. When he had finished, he sipped his tea and heaved an overwrought sigh.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Gentlemen, I hardly know how to thank you, but before I take advantage of any more hospitality, I must embarrass myself still further. I cannot pay your retainer in cash, Mr. Holmes, though I can visit a pawn shop should you be willing to wait until the morrow.”</p>
			<p class="bt">So saying, he produced a small golden charm, obviously of enormous importance to him, considering it remained in his possession, and I passed it to Holmes. My friend had lit his pipe and sat smoking meditatively with his stork’s legs crossed. He turned the shining object over in his fingers and tossed it in an arc back to our client.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Saint Cecilia. Thank you, Mr. Falconer, but when a client lacks the resources to meet my entire fee, I prefer to leave the subject of money forgotten. Consider your own case to fall under the latter category. Which opera company was it sacked you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Falconer’s jaw dropped. He rubbed at the short, wiry bristles on his cheeks. “How the devil did you know I was a singer?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How could I not know? You can’t open your mouth to speak without betraying your extensive vocal training to the expert. As you are sleeping rough of late—either Hyde Park or St. James’s, which both feature the loamy light brown soil which has attached itself to your coat—it is clear you are no longer employed, but a man of your obvious talent could find work at any time were your general condition improved. The scene just enacted in my hall, forgive my mentioning it, would not have occurred to someone lacking in creative sensitivity. Add to this the detail that Cecilia is the patron saint of musicians, and the matter becomes indisputable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Our client winced at the reference to his earlier actions. “It was the Garrick Street Players, sir. I have played Morales, Guglielmo, Doctor Falke. . . . I had a permanent position in the company, but as you can see . . .” He gestured at himself. “Hyde Park is indeed my residence of late.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What happened?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Falconer shook his unkempt head. “The oldest tale ever told, Mr. Holmes. A love lost, a terrible habit gained—the triteness is almost as painful as the shame.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But it is not this condition which drove you to such despair.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No indeed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Consult me at your leisure, then.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes, I have been kidnapped.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Indeed so?” Holmes puffed at his pipe. “And, having made a lucky escape, you wish to see your assailants brought to justice, I take it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes,” our client said softly, “I have been kidnapped and released back into the streets of London unharmed three times.”</p>
			<p class="bt">As he frequently did when surprised, Holmes swept forward in his chair, grey eyes glowing like cinders. “Remarkable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, hardly credible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The facts, if you please, from the beginning.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I shall do as best I can.” Mr. Falconer drew a still-unsteady finger around the rim of his saucer. “I am an only child orphaned at a young age and entirely alone in the world. You see me at my lowest tide, gentlemen, and have been subjected to an outrageous display to boot—no, no, I must speak of it, for the hopelessness I suffer has direct bearing on my case. After the first occasion on which I was abducted and set free, I half-thought it a grotesque joke and half a fevered nightmare, and when I told the story to my few mates at the only pub which offers me a rough bench any longer, The Fox’s Tooth, they laughed it off as a dream. After the second, which was identical to the first, I went to Scotland Yard. They would have none of me, and told me I had best look sharp or end up in jail myself for telling the police outrageous tales. The third instance ended this morning, after which I pawned my father’s watch—which had used to be decorated with my Saint ­Cecilia—exchanged it for a gun with which to protect myself or end myself, I hardly knew which; indulged in considerably more than I should have done, as per usual, for I cannot seem to stop; and then sought you out. If you fail to believe me, I shall run mad.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Pray master yourself, then, and deliver your story with clarity and confidence.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Can’t you see, sir, that I have no confidence left?” Mr. Falconer protested, but immediately thereafter he snarled in disgust. “Very well. I have nothing save my life left to lose, after all.</p>
			<p class="bt">“As you say, Mr. Holmes, I come from Lexden, and for some twenty years earned my living by my voice. In my youth, I traveled with various touring companies, but as I approached forty, I began to tire of the lifestyle, for all that it was gay and convivial, and joined the Garrick Street Players as a permanent fixture of their season. The glamorous habits of a life led flitting from city to city did not leave me, however, as I now regret beyond my ability to tell you. Thus, when a woman with whom I had fallen abjectly in love treated me cruelly—indeed, had I been her bitterest foe, she could not have done a more thorough job—I fell from the tightrope upon which I’d been balancing for decades and landed as you see me: bereft, degraded, nigh-destroyed. I am embarrassed to say that I am not always in a state of awareness or remembrance, and it’s difficult therefore to blame anyone for not believing me when I can barely believe myself.</p>
			<p class="bt">“About a month ago, I made a few shillings by street-singing near to Covent Garden, which is how I earn enough for food and drink, and afterward made my way to The Fox’s Tooth to drown my recollections in cheap gin. Unsurprisingly, the events of the night blurred after nine or ten o’clock, and I cannot tell you what time I left the pub, nor whether or not I made it to Hyde Park and the low line of shrubbery which has of late kept me reasonably dry and hidden from the constables. God, how little I’m sure of at this point! No doubt I am the worst client you’ve ever had the misfortune to address,” he added bitterly.</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s eyelids had drooped as he listened, and now he shut them completely. “Mr. Falconer, the worst clients want me to tell them whether their spouses have been unfaithful, or hope that I can locate lost railway luggage. Stop telling me what you don’t know, and start telling me what you do.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite right.” Mr. Falconer nodded more decisively. “I will waste no more of your time, gentlemen. Yes, upon the night I just described, I fell into a stupor, only to awaken in completely strange environs. My head felt wooden, my legs weak, my vision full of stars—it wasn’t like my usual symptoms at all, sir, and God knows they are plentiful. No, this was like emerging from an opium dream. The room in which I found myself spun, and I reeled from wall to wall in terror, not knowing who had put me there or why.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Describe the chamber to me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The first time, I was so disoriented that I fear I didn’t learn as much as I should have—but on the second and third, although rattled and sick, I examined the place thoroughly, and it was the same each time. It was a bedroom, Mr. Holmes. An ordinary bedroom with pale stripes on the walls, a walnut desk with an empty drawer, olive-hued curtains, a comfortable bed with a green quilt, and very queer light.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How so?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Each time I have awoken there, the lamp has been off and the nocturnal atmosphere was bathed in blue. I should swear to it, though in my state I don’t like to swear to anything.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, well, let us assume you can swear to this or we shall have nothing to go on at all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“True enough, and possibly it was a symptom of the drug I believe I was given. In any case, on every occasion, I shouted for help at the top of my lungs to no avail. But when I had quieted, hoarse and sick, I could always hear muffled arguing. A woman’s voice, pleading, and a man’s denying her request, or so it seemed. The words were indistinct and I might not have recalled them in any case, so porous is my mind, but I am certain the tone was that of an altercation. At times, I could hear the woman weeping, Mr. Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ominous.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Extremely so. The sound filled me with dread. Every time, the urgency and passion with which they fought have increased. I am certain of it as I’m certain of little else, since other than listening to these quarrels, and shouting to the speakers for help, there was nothing to occupy me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s eyes opened with a shrewd edge to their stare. “But you must have interacted with someone when they went to restore your freedom.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mr. Falconer shuddered and carefully set down his teacup. “Yes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, come to the point, then! What sort of individual was your jailer?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I never saw him when he took me, for he always came upon me in my cups and snatched me up unawares,” Mr. Falconer whispered. “But when he came to release me . . . He is a tall man, Mr. Holmes, nearly as tall as you, dressed all in black, wearing a hood like an executioner’s.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My neck prickled with dread at the image.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What was his eye color?” Holmes asked with clinical detachment.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am sorry, sir, but I could not say. He terrified me. Three times this man has overpowered me, though doing me no harm save to spirit me into a blue-lit bedroom. Once about a month ago, a fortnight after that, and finally last night. I flew at him when the door opened this time, but to no avail.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What was his voice like?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He never spoke to me. He only entered with a rag and pressed it over my face. It confirmed to my mind that—assuming any of this is even true—I was dosed with chloroform, which explained my feelings of delirium.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What did his hands look like?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I couldn’t possibly tell you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes frowned in frustration. “Very well, leave the hooded man aside for now. What was across the street when you looked out the window? You must have done that much.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tumbledown brick row houses, Mr. Holmes. I could have been anywhere.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It won’t do, Mr. Falconer. I really think we can make progress if we only set our minds to the task at hand. What color?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh—red brick, Mr. Holmes. With grey trim.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How many stories?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Three.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You say they were not well maintained?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“They were poor and plain, and some of the windows were broken and stopped up with newspaper. But there are many such places in London. The only truly unnatural aspect of the landscape was the blue light. It quite unnerved me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Where did you find yourself when you awoke?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“At Covent Garden, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ah, that is highly suggestive.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How so?” I inquired.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Falconer sings thereabouts for the odd coin. Likely the hooded man has heard him perform, and he associates the place with his victim, even if unconsciously. It seems natural to return him there. Have you encountered any strange audience members of late?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No one stands out to me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am not surprised, but it was worth asking. You can tell me nothing more, I take it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Heaving an overwrought sigh, our client shook his head.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I will take your case pro bono, Mr. Falconer.” Holmes set aside his pipe and drummed his fingertips together. “It is remarkable, and therefore of its own intrinsic value to me. I must set one condition, however.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Anything, Mr. Holmes!” he cried. “I should take heart, truly, if only I knew you believed me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I believe you, but owing to the lack of hard data, I cannot promise immediate results. You must swear that in the interim, you will do nothing tragic with this pistol. I should be very put out indeed if you ruined my investigation by wrecking your health in a permanent fashion.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Our guest’s already red face colored still more deeply. “Nothing of the sort will happen, Mr. Holmes, I vow it will not. I already owe you my life, seemingly. It would be the worst sort of disrespect to discard it now.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then good night, Mr. Falconer, and I shall do all I can. I take it a note sent to The Fox’s Tooth would find you if I had need?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, Mr. Holmes.” He took the gun my friend held out and hastily slipped it into his jacket pocket, going for his still-damp coat.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Have you enough funds left over to find shelter tonight?” I could not help asking.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Think nothing of my circumstances, sirs, or at least not those which I’ve brought on myself,” he objected with a hollow expression that could not fail to painfully remind me of my late brother’s. “Far more deserving men—aye, and women and children too—are out in the cold this evening. There’s a cranny behind a statue in Newcastle Street not many know of that’s mostly dry, and I’ll make my way there. Good night, and thank you again for your extreme generosity. I pray you can find some answers for me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When Mr. Falconer had gone, I rose and banked the fire, skirting the puddle left by his coat and attempting not to dwell upon the sibling I had lost untimely to his cups. “A highly disturbing account.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And an absolutely unique one. I’ve been searching my memory for a parallel case to no avail. What do you make of it?” Holmes asked, tamping out his pipe.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is certainly nightmarish, and there may be nothing more to make of it than that—a nightmare. But I should abhor the feeling that I was in mortal danger and my story was not believed by anyone. We seem to owe it to him to investigate.”</p>
			<p class="bt">After a pause, Holmes swept his attention over me from top to toe. “You appear troubled, my dear Watson.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It has been a troubling evening.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not generally troubled, specifically so.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Replacing the poker, I admitted, “My own history makes the matter more personal than it should be, perhaps.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course,” he acknowledged, his severe brows thawing. “But we encounter such examples of self-ruination all too often without your taking them to heart so.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You may consider this a whimsical quirk of the softer emotions, then.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, for heaven’s sake,” he protested, concerned. “Out with it, man.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If you insist, very well. Mr. Falconer is one of the last men on earth whom I should entrust with a gun.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What else could I have done?” he appealed, worrying at his high forehead in energetic circles. “Stolen it from him? When his life seems in danger?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course not.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear fellow, I thought you frowned upon my criminal tendencies.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You misunderstand me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You imply I ought to have acted differently!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am not suggesting that there was a better solution, Holmes. I am suggesting there was none.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, what’s the use, I can’t think like this, not when my head feels full of needles.” My friend glided to his feet with a despairing huff. “Good night, Watson. If any other invaders with guns should happen to storm our gates, I beg that you will do me the favor of dispatching them without the necessity of consulting me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes slammed his bedroom door considerably harder than any man with a headache ought to have done, and I retired upstairs. When I had readied myself for sleep, listening to the wind shriek like a banshee and the slush spatter against the window, I wondered whether Mr. Horatio Falconer was fit to remember his promise when staring out from the bottom of a gin bottle. More despondently, I wondered whether it was the case that, even supposing he spared his own life so far as weaponry was concerned, he might destroy himself all too quickly simply by means of patronizing The Fox’s Tooth, rendering my friend’s assistance equally pointless.</p>
			<p class="btspace">The morning dawned clear and cold and I woke early, plagued by dreams of a gun pressed hard against Holmes’s stark skull. As I washed and shaved, I thought again of Mr. Falconer and, in the broad light of day, could not give his tale nearly so much credence as I had granted it when sitting rapt before a midnight fireplace whilst the tempest without erased the rational world. By having been made his confidants, I could not help feeling, we might also have been made his dupes, even supposing his intentions blameless. A man of such unbridled passion, who admitted to extreme mental decay and who had invaded our home in such a shocking manner, could not be trusted, no matter Holmes’s love of the inexplicable and bizarre. I made up my mind to tell him so.</p>
			<p class="bt">When I reached the sitting room, however, I found a note indicating that Holmes had already departed but would return before luncheon. This was surprising, given the trials of the previous night, but Holmes better than any other man I knew was capable of thumbing his nose at fatigue. I was at my desk writing in my journal when my fellow lodger breezed in at a quarter to eleven whistling an air from <span class="charoverride3">The Marriage of Figaro.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">“Heavens, Holmes, you can’t have slept more than a few hours. I’m surprised to see you in such good spirits,” I remarked as he shed his outer garments.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, how terribly uncharitable.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I laughed. “How is your head?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“In perfect working order. And how are you faring?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve been puzzling over the Falconer business.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“As have I, I assure you. I just took definitive steps.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What if he is right to doubt himself so severely?” I argued, pressing my pen against my lip. “The room could be a fantasy associated with his childhood, the product of an imagination which has in some ways reverted to an infantile state.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes smoothed a palm over his black hair as he approached me, returning it to its usual neat sheen. “You’ve been reading <span class="charoverride3">Die Traumdeutung</span> again.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, Dr. Freud makes some intriguing arguments.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, Watson, after all this time, I had hoped you might do a bit better,” Holmes remarked, but his tone was jocular. “All right, let us suppose that everything we have heard was due to paranoid hallucinations brought on by hard living. Where does this leave us as far as the facts are concerned? Mr. Falconer dreams he has multiple times been assaulted, abducted, and freed by a hooded man. What do we make of the point that on every <span class="charoverride3">single </span>occasion, he awakened with the sensation of having been drugged and not drunk? The gentleman has been drinking for a lengthy period, I think you’ll agree—he ought to have a grasp on the sensation by this time. I am more inclined to believe the chloroform rag is real.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps,” I conceded doubtfully.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You suggest his mind has deteriorated, which is a fair argument, but let me counter it with this one: if our client experienced fantastical nightmares in which ghouls of every variety set upon him and there was no pattern to the horror, I should agree with your suspicion of delirium tremens, and we should not be assisting him. If conversely he suffered from trauma which somehow created a tragic idée fixe regarding this room, and were it always identical, this morning I should have had my feet up before a roaring fire. But what do you make of the visions as he has actually told them to us?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“They seem unlikely in the extreme.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But not impossible! Mark that, Watson. None of it is impossible. Now, he claims to have been taken three times. The place to which he is spirited is very specific as he paints it: it is well furnished with a comfortable bed, a walnut desk, and dark green curtains. It is always night when he arrives, and the light is tinged with blue. He is locked within, and his cries are met with no reaction save when the hooded man arrives with the chloroform rag—and I think it apparent this same hooded man absconds with him in the first place. He always hears a woman pleading and weeping. Each time, she has grown more agitated, and the man’s answering voice more insistent.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“All of this could be mere delusion. Why blue light of all things?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Does nothing suggest itself to you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Apparently not.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, well, never mind, then. It is perfectly clear to me, however. In fact, I made it the starting point of my investigation, though my search has not yielded results as of yet.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When he did not explain further, I understood that, as was most often the case, he had no intention of doing so. “You sound so definite. How are you sure of Mr. Falconer’s story?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Because when he awakens, he is in Covent Garden.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What bearing can that have?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If he were dreaming, would he not regain consciousness in Hyde Park, where he in his fashion resides?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Pausing, I considered. “I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Granted, thinking is not your vocation, but you might have given it a touch more effort.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I knew better than to rise to such desiccated bait. “All you are saying may be true, but it remains unlikely that we’ll ever get to the bottom of it unless we can comprehend what they want him for in the first place. Radical medical research? Some deranged idea of sport? Nothing can be answered before we understand <span class="charoverride3">why.</span>”</p>
			<p class="bt">Laughing, Holmes clapped me on the shoulder. “A more dignified and logical response could be expected of no man save you to the best of my knowledge, Watson, though I admit I haven’t met <span class="charoverride3">everyone.</span> However, your perspective evinces a degree of pessimism I fail to share. We are not entirely helpless.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Really?” I brightened. “What can we do? You said the clue of the blue light has come to nothing thus far.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, but it will come to something. And we can dog his steps. I’ve set an Irregular on the task with strictest orders to interfere in no way should he feel the smallest bit uneasy. I’ve dark misgivings regarding this case.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Because it seems to be based upon the ravings of a lunatic?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No,” he corrected me, slipping his hands into his pockets. “Because hooded men are dangerous when unmasked, and I aim to unmask one.”</p>
			<p class="btspace">I saw little of my friend during the next few days, but often watched as a bushy-bearded worker with the thick leather gloves of an ironsmith vanished from our lodgings only to appear again after nightfall and emerge from Holmes’s bedroom wearing his dressing gown and a guarded expression. Thus I heard nothing more of Mr. Falconer’s case until one night when Holmes and I sat in a corner of a shabby café in Bethnal Green Road, sipping coffee following a simple repast. As to what on earth we were doing so far from Westminster I had no notion, for Holmes after sending me a telegram advising me of the appointment had done nothing save comment upon the occupation of Peking and praise the establishment’s admittedly passable shepherd’s pie. Since over the many years of our acquaintance I have taken diminishing pleasure in asking questions that will go unanswered, I expressed only mild surprise at our environs, and waited for Holmes to perform his conjuring trick.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you find the night too bitter for a brief walk?” my friend asked, an impish smile playing at the edges of his mouth.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No indeed. Doubtless it will lead us to whatever you mean to show me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes made a rueful noise as he settled the bill. “If you grow any more apt at observation and inference, I shall have no stock of surprises left. Come, we’ve only a few blocks to travel, and I admit I think this may interest you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The night was frigid indeed, with creeping tendrils of fog crawling through the alleys and sinister ice crystals painted in the cracked windowpanes. I ducked deeply into my collar and Holmes did likewise, with only the high arc of his nose betraying his identity. Though Bethnal Green Road was exceedingly populous—indeed, notoriously so—as it was drawing close to ten o’clock, we were the only pedestrians save for hard-seeming men with bitter, cast-down eyes. We had been walking for only about two minutes when we reached Ainsley Street, and as we turned onto this narrower thoroughfare, I came to a halt with a low groan.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, what an idiot you must think me!” I lamented.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not at all. I reached the conclusion that Mr. Falconer’s story seemed to you so outlandish and yet so distressingly familiar that a further stretch of the imagination was beyond your scope,” he returned easily.</p>
			<p class="bt">We faced a simple red brick house trimmed in peeling white, matching those on the other side of the impoverished street, exactly as Mr. Falconer had described them—but interrupting the moldering residences was a police station, its familiar beacon of blue light shining upon the filthy pavement and the mottled trunks of the plane trees.</p>
			<p class="bt">“This is J Division,” Holmes remarked. “Bethnal Green and environs, added by the Yard in eighteen eighty-six owing to the alarmingly rapid expansion of the city. I would have introduced you to it earlier, but I wanted to identify the exact house. It is this one, number forty-six Ainsley Street.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How do you know?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Doubtless you have wondered where I’ve been for the past few days. As soon as I identified which police station’s light Mr. Falconer observed, I made it my business to loiter here incognito. As Bethnal Green is an infamous slum, it wouldn’t have done for me to lurk in respectable tweeds, you understand. The house immediately to the left of the station possesses an exceedingly tall resident, with a physician’s sign in the front window. His name is Dr. Elijah Ashman.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“The hooded man?” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Such is my working hypothesis.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But who would practice medicine in such a place?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes’s eyes gleamed beneath the brim of his hat. “Who would practice medicine in a house no one calls upon, to boot?”</p>
			<p class="bt">We stood across from the house in question, conversing—but we fell instantly silent when its door opened and a woman appeared, quietly but respectably dressed, the cobalt illumination lending her appearance an otherworldly quality. Holmes gripped my arm.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Hullo!” he exclaimed. “And here we could well have the distraught female in question.”</p>
			<p class="bt">The strange woman’s face was indeed pinched with worry. She walked at a brisk pace toward the main road and Holmes followed at a short distance, I at his side. When she reached the wider thoroughfare and seemed to cast about for a cab, Holmes slid up next to her and said, “Madam, I wonder whether I might have a word with you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh!” she exclaimed, whirling.</p>
			<p class="bt">She was small and thin, with dark hair and a petite upturned nose, wearing a good-quality grey cloak lined with red. I should have thought her pretty in an unremarkable fashion save for her blinking brown eyes, which were somewhat vacant and altogether haunted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do I know you?” Her voice was tremulous. “This is not a part of London where I feel easy in my mind speaking to strangers.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nor indeed should you, but you are quite safe with us. I am Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend Dr. Watson. We were, in fact, desirous to know whether we could assist you in any fashion. You appeared distressed when you exited that house, if you’ll pardon my saying so.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I see,” she said in relief. “Well, that is all right then. I am Mrs. Sarah Pattison, but my husband has been deceased these five years—one of his ships was lost at sea—and he never did like my answering strange men, as he always called me too trusting by half. But I can tell that you are gentlemen and mean me no harm.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I glanced at Holmes during this rambling confession, but he did not appear the smallest bit impatient.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You honor us, Mrs. Pattison,” he said smoothly. “Ah! Here is a cab. Might we share it with you en route to more salutary environs, and might you tell us what a woman of your obvious good character is doing visiting a physician in Bethnal Green of all places? In your husband’s absence, it would ease my mind to know you arrived home safely.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“An escort would be most welcome.” She fretted at one of her gloves, glancing from side to side. “It’s dreadful hereabouts, just <span class="charoverride3">dreadful.</span> I’d not be here at all if my brother James were not friends with Dr. Ashman, who lives in poverty only because he practices such an obscure branch of medicine. He is a psychologist. He is trying to bring James back from the brink and—I’m sorry,” she murmured as she dissolved in tears. “My brother has fallen into a life of terrible dissolution and hardly knows himself. It’s too terrible to contemplate.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes handed her up into the waiting cab. “You must tell us about it, and we shall see you safe home.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mystified both at Mrs. Pattison’s words and at her absent, almost childlike way of enunciating them, I followed Holmes into the four-wheeler. Mrs. Pattison gave her address as Cockspur Street near to Trafalgar Square, and we pulled away from the grim suburb, Holmes polite but intent and I determined to say nothing lest his powers of persuasion be interrupted and her steady flow of chatter stopped. The gas lamps we passed flickered wanly against our faces through the shaded windows, illuminating us in unnerving glimpses.</p>
			<p class="bt">“James was always wild, but I never thought he should come to this pass,” Mrs. Pattison lamented, drawing back her hood. “He fell in with a bad lot, Mr. Holmes, and entirely lost his self-respect—he has nearly ruined himself, and if Dr. Ashman cannot help him, I shall despair. Since my husband died, James was all I had in the world, and indeed he lived off an allowance I gave him inherited from the shipping concern. Now I write out the checks to Dr. Ashman instead, to settle my brother’s debts, for it really wouldn’t be appropriate for me to meet with such low types and James would only spend it all on drink. Oh, to think that he doesn’t recognize his own sister any longer! It’s heartbreaking. I shan’t be able to bear it if he dies alone, in the cold, not knowing himself. He fancies himself an opera singer, Mr. Holmes. Can you imagine? His voice has always been stirring, but he is a clerk at a maritime warehouse.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My pulse sped significantly as she spoke. As for my friend, he appeared outwardly composed, but his entire posture vibrated with leashed energy.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And you visit your brother periodically, at Dr. Ashman’s practice?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, yes. When James is there, the doctor sends me word. My poor brother is delusional—raving, sleeping out of doors—and it’s quickly growing worse. I can’t help feeling that if I saw him face-to-face, he might know me again, but Dr. Ashman insists that he has grown most violent, and in his medical capacity, he cannot allow me to actually enter the sickroom. When I hear James’s voice, that beautiful voice that once brought me such comfort—oh, I can’t describe how agonizing it is to hear him scream to be let out when all Dr. Ashman wants is to conduct sessions with him, to compel him to see reason. Perhaps try hypnosis or some other therapy. Anything which might do some good. But by the time James has sweated out the liquor, he is most desperate for more of it, and never has any difficulty escaping after Dr. Ashman has opened the door.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“An appalling situation, to be sure.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She nodded. “We are considering transferring him to a private asylum, which is the reason I was there tonight—I have met with my lawyer, and money will be no object as regards his care.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Nothing I had ever read of Dr. Freud’s could have prepared me for Mrs. Pattison’s statement, and my alarm must have shown on my countenance, for Holmes briefly pressed a warning hand to my knee.</p>
			<p class="bt">“When came your brother to such a desperate pass that you could not be allowed in the room with him?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A little over a month ago.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Did you observe him in Dr. Ashman’s company previously?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, many times—the two were very close, and though I had never before been to his practice, they had called on me at my home. At one point, he and James lodged together, so he was in the perfect position to note when my brother truly began to take leave of his senses, though as I said he has always been difficult to manage.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And about a month ago is also when you began giving his allowance to his companion?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes. Oh, Mr. Holmes, it was such a difficult decision—but really, there was nothing I could do, for the first time I heard him shrieking to be released, I knew he could no longer be trusted with it himself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Did Dr. Ashman suggest this arrangement to you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I can’t recall. He may have done. It is good to speak to someone about this, for I have been nearly at the end of my wits. I am so glad you gentlemen were standing there, and offered to see me home.”</p>
			<p class="bt">She began to cry helplessly. Holmes leaned over and patted her gloved hand, and I could not help comparing her with her brother—his overabundance of emotions, his lack of control over them. When we had nearly arrived at Trafalgar Square, she had quieted, and Holmes’s face was suffused with grave intensity.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mrs. Pattison, before your brother is committed, you must be given the chance to attempt to bring him back to some awareness of himself. Your instincts do you credit—perhaps when you set eyes on him, your familial bonds will work a form of magic that no one other than a sister could manage.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you really think it possible?” she breathed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I do indeed. You must promise me you will insist to Dr. Ashman tomorrow that unless you can be convinced James truly would do you harm, you will not consent to pay for the asylum. If James is then intractable or sounds volatile, then of course you need not enter his chamber, but you owe it to your sibling to suggest the notion. I and Dr. Watson shall accompany you, so that you may feel quite safe.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, bless you, sir.” Mrs. Pattison folded her kerchief after dabbing a final time at her cheeks. “You are right, I believe, and it is always best to consult the opinions of impartial parties. Yes, I shall do as you say, supposing you promise to meet me in Bethnal Green. It will be late, I fear—Dr. Ashman can never manage to lay hands on my brother until around midnight.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Never mind the lateness,” Holmes demurred, his voice a low purr that set my nerves sparking. “It is vital that you are firm and insistent, and that you make mention of the funds for your brother’s care being absolutely at stake. You may trust that we will meet you outside the house in Ainsley Street without fail.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Promising us that she would do as Holmes asked, Mrs. Pattison stepped down from the carriage. Holmes’s profile remained fixed on her until she had shut the door to her residence, and then he banged his fist against the wall of the hansom in what appeared to be triumph, crying out, “Baker Street, driver!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, what in God’s name is the meaning of all this?” I marveled. “Has the man we know as Horatio Falconer lost his mind entirely?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I think we will find there is more to it than that, Watson,” Holmes drawled, rubbing his hands together like a man who is about to commence a card trick. “I shall not be sorry to arrive home—the temperature has dropped a full seven degrees, I think, since we left the house, and it was low enough in the first place.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You fear foul play,” I insisted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perhaps my nature is needlessly suspicious.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have at times known it to be so, but you are generally justified in your misgivings.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You flatter me extremely, my dear fellow. Regretfully, I can confirm nothing until we reconvene with Mrs. Pattison, though tonight I must write to Mr. Falconer—my Irregular confirms that he can be found daily at The Fox’s Tooth, and a wire will surely reach him there.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Do you mean to tell him we have seen his sister, Mrs. Pattison?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I mean to tell him by no means to use his gun no matter what may befall him tomorrow night,” Holmes replied, smiling wolfishly. “Your own revolver ought to be quite enough firepower for our purposes, Doctor.”</p>
			<p class="btspace">Tense as I am accustomed to being whilst awaiting the climax of some of Holmes’s darker cases, on that occasion my anxiety was palpable. The dismal weather, the loaded gun in my pocket as we left Westminster, Mrs. Pattison’s grief, and the so-called Mr. Falconer’s pitiable confusion—all combined to unsettle me as we bounced and jostled our way back to Bethnal Green on the following night at around eleven o’clock. Holmes, for his part, seemed as imperturbable as a marble bust; but every so often, his excitement would betray him and he would cut glances at the shadowed streets, tapping his knuckles against his thigh in anticipation.</p>
			<p class="bt">When we descended from the hack at Ainsley Street, I saw that we were not alone, for all that Mrs. Pattison had not yet arrived—our old friend Inspector Bradstreet stood in the road wearing an impassive stare, his bowler pulled low and his arms crossed against the daggerlike wind.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson.” He nodded cordially. “Care to share with me what we’re doing out in the cold tonight?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“With any luck, arresting a truly audacious criminal mastermind,” Holmes returned cheerily. “We have only to await his target to prevent an appalling instance of fraud—the second I’ve prevented in as many weeks, by the way. I ought to consider specializing. Ah, here is the lady herself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Mrs. Sarah Pattison approached us with eagerness, her trusting expression turning to bewilderment at the sight of the plainclothesman. “Oh, goodness. I came to meet two allies, and find I have three.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mrs. Pattison, this is Inspector Bradstreet, who is here to ensure that the myriad evils of Bethnal Green do not get the better of us,” Holmes returned. “We are in a dangerous neighborhood, as you’ve astutely noted yourself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“An inspector! How decent of you—many thanks for your protection, sir.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, now that we are all acquainted, shall we see what we can do about persuading your brother to mend his ways?” Holmes plunged into the street and we followed, I with my hand on the comforting weight of the gun in my pocket. “What is his full name, Mrs. Pattison?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Did I never tell you? Abergavenny,” she answered. “I was Sarah Abergavenny, and he is Mr. James Abergavenny.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Thank you, and might I suggest that you keep well back if anything untoward takes place?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, Mr. Holmes, I shall be most careful.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Nodding, the detective rapped decisively on the door. Upon the instant it opened, we could hear a muffled wailing from upstairs which had been undetectable from the street. A tall, hatchet-faced man stood in the foyer, glaring out. His domed head was hairless, his eyes were dark and widely set, and his general appearance was suave and friendly enough save for a coldly appraising twist to his set of full, almost sensuous lips.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whatever have we here? Mrs. Pattison, as you can hear, now is no time to make personal appeals to your brother, though I quite understand and sympathize with your sentimental desire to set eyes on him. But what a crowd you’ve brought with you! Gentlemen, it should be apparent that I’ve a very sick patient upstairs, and one who cannot be cajoled or bargained with—this is no time for social calls, and I’ll thank you to leave Mr. Abergavenny to my care.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I am determined that Mr. Abergavenny’s sister see him,” Holmes declared, his foot firmly in the doorway. “I refuse to depart before my wishes in this matter are carried out—Mrs. Pattison <span class="charoverride3">will</span> be allowed entrance, and I in her company as witness.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You can do no such thing!” Dr Ashman snapped, bristling. “It would be perilous to all parties, quite impossible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I think you’ll find he can,” our friend of the Yard objected, showing his badge and a document. “I am Inspector Bradstreet, and I’ve a warrant to search the premises.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How dare you, sir! On what grounds?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Suspected kidnap’ will do for the moment,” Holmes replied, edging forcefully past the doctor, “although I shouldn’t be surprised over additions to the list, so we shall keep an open mind. Hand over the key to the spare bedroom, if you please.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ll harm my patient, and my personal friend, if you upset him further,” Dr. Ashman growled, though now his lofty cranium shone with nervous moisture. “I’ll do no such thing!”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Pity. But it won’t delay us long.” Holmes held up his set of adaptable keys, jangling them, as Bradstreet and I elbowed our way inside with the lady well shielded. “Keep an eye on this one, Inspector, and don’t let him budge. Watson, Mrs. Pattison, quickly!”</p>
			<p class="bt">We rushed upstairs, then watched as Holmes crouched before the door. The whimpers and cries were much more audible here, and I easily recognized the voice of our client, though he sounded barely intelligible. Fright and despair had so overwhelmed him that he might have been a great hulking wolf, howling in the wilderness against the agony of a steel trap.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, my poor James,” Mrs. Pattison fretted, tears springing once again into her eyes. “How I shall hate to see what he has come to.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, the sight of him may indeed surprise you. Just coming, Mr. Falconer, calm yourself!” my friend called, and the cacophony abruptly ceased.</p>
			<p class="bt">When Holmes threw wide the door, the man I knew as Mr. Falconer staggered through it with a groan, holding both his dirtied hands to his coarsely matted head. Mrs. Pattison shrieked, shrinking back against the wall with her gloved hand over her heart.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh! Oh! This is not my brother!” she cried.</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, I rather thought not,” Holmes said with evident satisfaction. “Steady on, then! Watson, will you do what you can for him? Though I rather think the best remedy will prove sleeping it off. Mrs. Pattison, your brother has been missing for over a month now, but his continued existence enabled this Dr. Ashman—supposing that is even his name, for the plaque in the window is quite new—to continue leaching away your savings, as no doubt he had previously done sponging funds off your brother when in his cups. I shall discover what truly happened to your sibling, on my honor. Just now, however, I need a word with Inspector Bradstreet. And the use of his set of handcuffs.”</p>
			<p class="btspace">“There never really was any difficulty in the matter,” Holmes said to me after I had revived poor Mr. Horatio Falconer somewhat and we had sent him, shaken but grateful, away from Bethnal Green in a cab (after eliciting the solemn vow that he would do his best to improve his state before being called upon to give testimony at the trial). “You were right to say that motive was everything, and I very much fear that Mr. Abergavenny will prove to have been long dead before this bizarre tale is ended.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I cannot imagine how you worked it out,” I confessed, whistling for a cab. Mrs. Pattison had gone with Bradstreet and his prisoner to give a statement—indeed, had not stopped hectically talking in circles ever since Holmes had revealed the substitution.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You forget that I am the one who deduced that Mr. Falconer was an opera singer—he never told it to me, and I comprehended that his training was genuine.” Holmes sprang easily into the cab and I joined him after giving directions. “I knew our client to be telling the truth when he came to us. Why should he have been taken only to be left in a room, then? His voice was remarkable, but his appearance was carefully hidden by his abductor. Mrs. Pattison’s account was quite genuine, I believe. James Abergavenny truly had fallen upon hard times, his disgraceful habits doubtless greatly encouraged by his supposed ‘friend’ Ashman. Of course, I cannot yet tell you what became of this missing brother. But I can tell you that Dr. Ashman is a charlatan and a villain who probably could scarce believe his good fortune when he discovered a busker in Covent Garden who sounded just like Abergavenny—I told you it was significant that he was left there when set free.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, your reasoning is quite clear now.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“In the absence of Abergavenny, the money would vanish unless Ashman could keep up the illusion his friend had run mad. Mrs. Pattison is, you will agree, shockingly credulous, but Ashman took care that she should be exposed to the false brother only once a fortnight, and from behind a closed door. He likely didn’t even allow her upstairs, further masking the true sound of Falconer’s voice. I further surmise that he packed his drugged victim into well-paid cabs to transport him to Bethnal Green, with the excuse he had met with a beggar who needed medical care, or a fallen friend he was returning home, but we may never know that for certain unless Ashman confesses.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was masterfully done, Holmes—finding the house, working out the nature of the ruse, all of it,” I averred warmly. “But those aspects are not even the most wonderful thing you have accomplished during the case.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Whatever can you refer to?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Saving Mr. Falconer’s life twice.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Once,” he corrected, a single brow swooping quizzically.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Twice. Once at our flat, and once just now—he has promised to appear in court sober and sound-minded. Perhaps it is mindless optimism, but for some reason, I believe him. He will be a changed man, entirely thanks to you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes made a scoffing sound, though his cheekbones colored. “My dear Watson, you are the most incurably romantic chap I have ever encountered, and I do not mean that in a complimentary light.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Romantic I may well be, but on this occasion I was also correct. Mr. Horatio Falconer appeared at the assizes clean-shaven and well dressed, and not long thereafter we were privileged to see him perform in Bellini’s <span class="charoverride3">I puritani.</span> Sadly, however, thanks to Holmes’s relentless investigations, it was discovered that Elijah Ashman had murdered James Abergavenny in a drunken dispute, killing his own livelihood by sheer accident and thereby necessitating the outrageous impositions our client had suffered. Mrs. Pattison’s fortune was thus saved, but her dear brother was lost to her, an outcome which did not dispose her to be grateful to my friend. She claimed to anyone who would listen that she would prefer to think her brother mad than dead, an illogical quirk of sentiment for which Holmes claimed not to blame her in the smallest degree.</p>
