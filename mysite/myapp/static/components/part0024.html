<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter019">NINETEEN</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">The cart track sloped gently downhill and eventually widened into a long carriage drive approaching the front of the great manor house. From the crest of the hill, through the thin mist that hung above the trees, all shadowed in the grey light, I glimpsed tall redbrick chimneys, turrets and crenellations. The house was surrounded by woodland on three sides, a steep and densely wooded slope rising behind it. Under cover of the trees it would be possible to approach very near to the manor itself, but gaining access would be another matter. For now I could only go forward. Against his better judgement, I nudged the horse off the cart track and into the woodland, where I dismounted in a clearing and fastened his harness to a low-hanging branch, so that he could at least reach his head down to the grass underfoot. Patting him soundly and reassuring him that I would be back soon, I crept away as silently as I could, down the slope towards the grounds of Hazeley Court.</p>
<p class="indented">At the edge of the woodland where it opened out into lawn, I crouched in the shadows of the trees and gazed across at the building opposite. The mist was thinner here and I had a clear view of the house in the half-light. It had evidently been built to withstand assault, though its fortifications seemed part of its character, elegant rather than forbidding. It was constructed in a square formation around a central courtyard, the entrance guarded by a magnificent turreted gatehouse of two octagonal towers at least a hundred feet high, twice the height of the walls and topped with battlements. All these splendidly decorative fortifications had not saved their owner from prison, I reflected. If the Crown was short of revenues, then to seize the houses and lands of Catholic families who resisted the religious edicts must seem an easy source of profit. Should a missionary priest be found within these walls, all this estate would be forfeit and this beautiful house given to whichever of the queen’s favourites proved most deserving on the given day; fortunes snatched away and parcelled out to others whose loyalty needed to be bought, under cover of defending the faith. I shivered and pulled the cloak tighter around me. I was risking my life here, I knew, and who would profit from it, if I was right? Would I? Would Walsingham? Some other courtier whose advancement depended on the fall of the people within those handsome walls? But I was now convinced that Sophia was in there, and that the people she was trusting to help her were the very people who would do her the most harm.</p>
<p class="indented">A chill had arrived with the dawn and I realised my legs were trembling from the bareback ride; I eased myself back to standing, stretched my aching limbs and crouched again by the thick trunk of an old oak. The façade was adorned with elaborate carved window bays, though the windows on the sides I could see were all shrouded in darkness. There would be no getting through that gatehouse; a manor house this size would be well staffed with servants even if the master was in prison, and the front of the house was too exposed. My best hope, I decided, was to keep to the edge of the woodland and make my way around to the rear where I might find a postern or servants’ entrance that would be easier to breach. I fingered Humphrey’s old kitchen knife at my belt, reflecting that a judicious use of it might be my best hope of persuading the servants to answer my questions.</p>
<p class="indented">Crouching low, I began to stalk along the fringe of the trees, watching the house closely for any sign of movement or light in the windows, when suddenly I heard a twig snap behind me. I wheeled around, drawing the knife, but could see no movement in the depths of the wood, the trunks and undergrowth still shrouded in blueish mist. My breath quickened, gathering in small clouds around my face as I moved sideways, trying to keep my head turned in the direction from which the noise had come. The need to keep my own movements as silent as possible seemed less urgent than the need to move quickly; I strained to hear any further sounds beyond the crackling of sticks and leaves under my own feet, but though I heard nothing, I had the distinct sense that I was not alone in the wood.</p>
<p class="indented">At that moment I caught the soft crunch of a horse’s hooves over gravel and paused in the shadow of a thick oak to peer out. Below me, a small high-sided cart pulled by a hunched pony was making its way up the carriage drive towards the gatehouse tower, a man perched at the front bent over the reins. I watched as it rounded the side of the house, when suddenly a hooded figure broke from the cover of the trees, tearing across the sloping lawn towards the cart, now on the point of disappearing around the back of the house. I moved as fast as I could through the trees, trying to keep them both in sight, careless of my own cover; as the figure in the cloak reached the cart, he hurled himself at the unsuspecting driver, pulling him from his seat and wrestling him to the ground. The pony, which looked as if it would struggle to reach the end of the carriage drive again, barely registered the activity, its head sagging towards the grass. I charged out of the trees and ran towards them, my legs protesting; I reached them just as I saw the man in the cloak, who had one hand clamped over the other’s mouth and was kneeling on one of his arms, pull out a blade.</p>
<p class="indented">I threw myself at him, knocking him sideways and gripping the hand that held the blade; with a cry of fury, the hooded figure turned to me and I saw, with a stab of shock, that it was Thomas Allen. His face also froze in an expression of bewilderment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">You?</em>’ he said. ‘But—’</p>
<p class="indented">The fallen driver tried to back away from the scrummage; he was perhaps in his fifties, plump-faced and plainly terrified, shaking his head and whimpering while he implored me with bulging eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is this?’ I whispered urgently to Thomas. ‘Why do you fly at him with a knife?’</p>
<p class="indented">He frowned at me; I glanced at his hand where I held him hard by the wrist and realised that it was not a knife he wielded after all, but an open razor.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He is come for Sophia,’ Thomas said, through gritted teeth. ‘He is charged with helping her escape. But she must not go with him – it is a trap.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then she is here?’ I let go of Thomas’s arm, feeling a great wash of mingled relief and fear; if I had guessed that correctly, then the danger was not over.</p>
<p class="indented">The fellow nodded, looking from one to the other of us, his eyes terror-struck.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wait – I know this man,’ Thomas said, gripping his razor again and peering closely at the terrified driver. ‘He serves the Napper household. He cannot be allowed to return – he will raise the alarm.’</p>
<p class="indented">The man spluttered and shook his head more violently. I drew Humphrey Pritchard’s old kitchen knife from my belt and held it up to his face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your services are no longer needed here, friend,’ I said. ‘Get yourself home and say you were set on by highwaymen. Now!’ I added, giving him a shove as he continued to lie there, dumb with fright; that jolted him into gathering his wits, and he scrambled to his feet and ran off into the trees, casting nervous glances over his shoulder as he fled. Thomas turned to me, his eyes flashing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You should not have done that, Bruno. Now he will return to Oxford and they will send more men after us.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Peace, Thomas – it will take him at least an hour to walk back to the city, and there are more than enough men after me already. Tell me what is happening.’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas breathed deeply, then nodded, rose to his feet and jerked the weary pony’s head upright.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have come to save Sophia,’ he said, his bony face taut with determination. I saw a strange, hectic glitter in his eyes and his hands moved incessantly in nervous agitation.</p>
<p class="indented">‘From whom?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘From those whose safety she threatens.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Because of the child she carries?’</p>
<p class="indented">He snapped his head around and stared at me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you know about that? How came you to be here, Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Guesswork,’ I said, setting my jaw. ‘I think you too may be in danger, Thomas.’</p>
<p class="indented">He gave a short, bitter laugh.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did I not tell you that already?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I mean immediate danger. This very night.’</p>
<p class="indented">He opened his mouth to reply but at that moment a door opened in the rear range of the house and a voice called softly:</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who is there?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Pull up your hood and put away your weapon,’ Thomas hissed, drawing his own cloak over his head. ‘Do not speak if you can help it, until we are inside.’</p>
<p class="indented">I saw no choice but to follow suit as he picked up the pony’s reins and led the cart towards what looked like a servants’ entrance. The door was open a fraction and a tall, stooping man with sparse hair surveyed us through the gap with doubtful eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am come to carry a passenger to the coast, at the request of Lady Eleanor,’ Thomas said, in a low voice, keeping his hood pulled low. There was a long pause, as if they were both expecting the other to speak.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is a sign,’ the man behind the door said eventually, with an embarrassed cough.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh. <em class="calibre2">Ora pro nobis</em>.’ Thomas bit his lip.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I did not know there were to be two,’ the servant said, still regarding us with open suspicion. ‘Well, then – step inside.’ He opened the door a few inches wider and ushered us into a narrow passageway.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Wait here, I will tell Lady Eleanor you are arrived.’ He turned abruptly and strode away up the passage, taking his candle with him and leaving us standing in semi-darkness. I glanced at Thomas, who only shuffled anxiously from foot to foot and would not look at me. I wondered what we were walking into, and felt for the reassuring presence of Humphrey’s knife under my cloak.</p>
<p class="indented">Presently the tall servant returned, his look still guarded, as if he was not convinced by Thomas’s performance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Follow me,’ he said curtly, gesturing towards the passageway ahead. ‘They wish to see you for a moment, to go over the travel arrangements.’</p>
<p class="indented">I imagined, rather, that this Lady Eleanor had heard there were two men present and had grown suspicious. I glanced uneasily at Thomas; once inside this warren of passageways, we were trapped. The servant, holding his candle aloft, led us along the stone-flagged passageway, up a narrow flight of stairs and into a much grander, wood-panelled corridor where the boards were covered with scented rushes and early morning light filtered through low windows. We walked for so long that I was sure the corridor must run the entire range of the house, and indeed eventually it turned sharply to the right and we reached a short flight of stairs ending in an imposing wooden door. The man knocked, and after a soft murmur from within, he pushed open the door and gestured us forward.</p>
<p class="indented">I found myself in a high-ceilinged room that spanned the two towers of the gatehouse; by one window stood a woman who was perhaps in her forties, tall and elegant in a dark red satin dress with a stiff embroidered bodice and wide skirt, her hair bound up in a coif. Behind her was a closed door set into the wall of the octagonal tower on the right, while the matching door into the left tower revealed a spiral staircase leading upwards. The servant crossed the room, his shoes clacking on the solid brick floor, and whispered something in her ear; she nodded briefly and leaned past him to regard us with an expression of inscrutable calm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You come from William Napper?’ she asked softly. Thomas nodded confidently, though I was standing close enough to feel how his arm was trembling inside his cloak.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where is Simon?’ She glanced sharply from Thomas to me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He was taken ill, my lady,’ Thomas said, barely opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Shut the door behind you, then,’ she said, stepping forward. ‘We wish to be sure you are clear about the instructions. Barton, you will stay,’ she added, nodding to the stooping servant who moved to position himself strategically between us.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My lady,’ he murmured.</p>
<p class="indented">I glanced around, aware that Lady Eleanor was studying us intently.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would be grateful, my friends, if you would lower your hoods indoors,’ she said softly. ‘I know we must all be cautious about showing ourselves, but in this household we may trust one another. Sophia!’ She half turned to call over her shoulder.</p>
<p class="indented">The small door in the eastern tower opened and Sophia Underhill stepped out, just as Thomas glanced once at me and drew down his hood with a flourish. Sophia gave a little scream and looked from Thomas to me, her hands flying up to her mouth. Reluctantly I lowered my own hood and her face seized in a strange rictus of disbelief.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Bruno</em>?’ she whispered eventually, her eyes betraying her utter confusion. ‘How came <em class="calibre2">you</em> here? And Thomas?’ She jerked her head toward Thomas; I noticed that the tall lady had stepped forward, gesturing to the servant named Barton to stand by her, her face calm but clearly alert to the tension of the situation.</p>
<p class="indented">Before I could answer Sophia, she had turned to Thomas, her expression pleading.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thomas, I know what you think but you are mistaken. If you care for me at all, you will let me go. <em class="calibre2">Please</em>,’ she added, seeing the implacable look on his face, her voice cracking slightly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Who are these people, Sophia?’ asked the older woman with a hint of sharpness. ‘Do you know them? Are they here to hinder you?’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas turned to her and executed a brief, insincere bow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Lady Tolling, we have only come to return Sophia safely to her family, who are sorely distressed by her absence. If she comes quietly with us now, nothing more will be said of this business.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The same family who have threatened her life for her faith?’ Lady Tolling replied evenly, giving Thomas an appraising glance from head to foot. ‘We are not so easily taken in, young man.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But I fear you may have been, Lady Tolling,’ Thomas said, with impeccable politeness, a dangerous glint in his eye. ‘I fear Mistress Underhill may not have told you the whole truth about her urgent wish to leave England.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thomas, no!’ Sophia cried, lurching towards him, her hand outstretched. ‘You do not know what you do! Do not stand in our way now, it will do no good. You will not get what you want, and all will be lost.’</p>
<p class="indented">The tall servant named Barton took a step closer to Thomas, who glanced at him for a moment before turning back to Sophia and laughing, his head thrown back, a wild, manic sound that echoed around the wooden timbers of the ceiling.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sophia, Sophia,’ he said, gently chiding as if speaking to a naughty child. ‘What lies have you been telling these good people? Have you persuaded Lady Tolling to help you escape so that you can join a French convent, because your family would persecute you for your conversion?’</p>
<p class="indented">Sophia blanched; her face stiffened and I saw real fear in her eyes. She looked frantically at Lady Tolling and then I saw her legs tremble slightly, so that she stumbled; instinctively I moved to help her but the servant, Barton, was between us in an instant, glaring at me, and I saw now that he carried an instrument that looked like a poker at his belt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come with us,’ Thomas said, in a softer tone. ‘This will not end the way you hope, Sophia, you know in your heart it will not. He means to kill you.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sophia shook her head furiously, her lips pressed tightly together.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are blind and stubborn, Thomas, and you have ever been so!’ she cried, taking a step towards him. ‘You have always acted impetuously, always convinced that you are right! But you are badly mistaken this time, as I have already tried to tell you.’</p>
<p class="indented">Lady Tolling folded her arms impatiently and her glance flickered from Sophia to Thomas, but her voice remained steady.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is this about? Who are these men, Sophia? Who means to kill her?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He is deluded, my lady, his wits are troubled, he knows not what he says,’ Sophia interrupted quickly, her throat tight with emotion.</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas turned to face Lady Tolling with defiant eyes, apparently undaunted by her rank, the defeated manner I had seen in Oxford entirely vanished.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your visiting priest,’ he said, enunciating the words precisely. ‘Father Jerome Gilbert.’</p>
<p class="indented">If Lady Tolling was perturbed either by the accusation that she harboured a priest or that this same priest was bent on murder, she gave no sign of it, save for a small twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, let us ask him,’ she said, her voice calm as ever, and she crossed the room in a rustling of satin and stepped into the small antechamber on the right-hand side, from which Sophia had entered. We caught a brief exchange of voices from within and almost immediately she returned, followed by the young man I had known as Gabriel Norris.</p>
<p class="indented">He was dressed as usual in a well-cut doublet and breeches of sombre black, though evidently of costly fabric, and wearing good leather boots with a silver buckle, his blond hair swept back from his face. Handsome and self-possessed, he looked every inch the country gentleman’s son; no one passing him in the town or the colleges would have taken him for a secret missionary. He looked from Thomas to Sophia to me with a steady, careful gaze, then nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then,’ he said, spreading out his hands, palms upward. ‘Let us say what needs to be said. Lady Eleanor – with the greatest respect, I would ask that you leave us. There are matters that must be resolved between old friends before any of us can go on.’</p>
<p class="indented">Lady Tolling seemed unwilling to relinquish control of any drama to be played out under her roof.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your safety, Father,’ she murmured, glancing at me and Thomas. ‘These men have not even been searched.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know them,’ Norris said reassuringly. ‘All will be well.’</p>
<p class="indented">When the door had closed behind her, Norris – or Jerome, as I supposed I must now call him – turned and fixed me with his clear green eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno,’ he said, a puzzled frown etched in the space between his brows. ‘I had thought—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You had thought Rowland Jenkes would have killed me tonight?’ I offered.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well – yes. Though I am not altogether surprised you shook him off – I told him you should not be underestimated. You are, after all, the man who escaped the Inquisition.’ His mouth curved into the barest hint of a smile, showing his white teeth. ‘Have you and Thomas formed your own anti-Catholic League?’ He paused briefly to laugh at his own joke. His manner was oddly relaxed and easy, given the circumstances, and now that he was not playing up to his flamboyant alias, he spoke in a more measured, mature tone. When he turned again to look me directly in the eye I was reminded of Humphrey Pritchard’s words: that Father Jerome made you feel you were the only person in the world that mattered. ‘Well, then,’ he continued, softly, ‘so you know the truth. Are you come to arrest me?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I came because I believed Sophia was in danger,’ I said, trying to return his look evenly, though there was something disconcerting about the intensity of his gaze. I determined I would not look away first.</p>
<p class="indented">‘From me?’ he asked, as if the idea were absurd. ‘Why should I wish to hurt Sophia, who has so recently been received through my ministry into the one true Catholic Church?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your <em class="calibre2">ministry</em>? Is that what you call it?’ Thomas burst out.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Because she carries your child,’ I said simply.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Slander,’ Jerome said, his eyes suddenly flashing with anger as he took a step towards me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did Thomas tell you that?’ Sophia cried, her cheeks blazing. ‘You know that everything he says is a lie?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No one told me,’ I said, now lying myself to spare Cobbett. ‘I may have been a monk but I grew up in a small village – I know how to recognise such things.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sophia said nothing, but pressed a hand over her mouth; Thomas smirked; Jerome sucked in his cheeks and appeared to be thinking.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will understand better than anyone, I think, Bruno,’ he said seriously, at length, ‘how a man may feel trapped by the strictures of his order. Yes, I sinned, but I would not commit a greater sin to cover it. Sophia will be conveyed in safety to Rouen, where she will be looked after until such time as I can join her.’ His eyes flicked towards Sophia as he spoke and she looked up gratefully, but there was something evasive about the look that convinced me he was lying for her benefit.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I also know from experience, Father,’ I said, ‘that the religious orders do not let go of their own so easily. Especially the Jesuits.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jerome nodded as if he were reluctantly impressed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Very good, Bruno, you have done your work thoroughly. Yes, I was ordained a Jesuit in Rome and joined the English mission through the seminary in Rheims. Thomas’s father brought me to Oxford – it was his role to co-ordinate the arrival of priests into Oxfordshire, find us safe houses, manage our provisions and disguises. The role Roger Mercer took over after Edmund’s exile. But you already know this, I presume.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have only recently begun to understand the connections,’ I admitted. ‘Yours was a very good disguise.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Disguise</em>.’ Thomas spat the word, his eyes cold. ‘It was no disguise at all. He carried himself as what he always was – the son of a wealthy family who expects others to dance to his tune. Joining the Jesuits was just another means of adventuring, for him. His <em class="calibre2">disguise</em>, as you call it, was so natural a part of him that in the end it became all too easy for him to forget his mission.’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas glared pointedly at Sophia; Jerome at least had the grace to look sheepish.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And fall into temptation,’ I mused, looking from Jerome to Sophia and remembering the Book of Hours the rector had found sewn into her mattress, with its suggestive, intimate dedication. <em class="calibre2">‘J’</em>. Not Jenkes, then, but Jerome. So it must have been Jerome, too, that Roger Mercer had expected to meet in the garden on Saturday morning, when he met his violent death instead.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But Roger Mercer found you out,’ I said, meeting the Jesuit’s level gaze as my chest suddenly tightened at the thought that I was standing mere feet from the killer. ‘And I had thought he was killed for those papers.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jerome’s eyes widened instantly and he stepped forward, his air of amused complacency vanished.</p>
<p class="indented">‘How do you know about the papers?’ he demanded, looking genuinely shaken for the first time since our arrival.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have seen them,’ I said, managing to sound calmer than I felt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In the chest in your chamber. Where you hid them.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In <em class="calibre2">my</em> …?’ He swung around and stared at Thomas now in disbelief. ‘But you said—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Roger Mercer caught them in the Grove one night,’ Thomas cut in, a note of spite in his voice. I noticed that his right hand was tucked inside his cloak. ‘Sophia used to steal the key from her father’s study at night. Mercer was appalled, as you may imagine. He came to our room the next day, exploding with rage. Reminded Father Jerome here how many Catholics in Oxford were risking their lives for his sake, and how he would not take the sacrament any longer from a priest living in mortal sin, and could not allow the others in their circle to do so unwittingly. Said he had no choice but to report Jerome to the Jesuit Superior.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have heard the Jesuits deal ruthlessly with those who stand in the way of their mission,’ I said, taking a step back, but Jerome had turned his green eyes on Thomas. ‘They are as ready to kill for their faith as to die for it – as you have already shown.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘As <em class="calibre2">I</em> have shown?’ Jerome looked back at me for a moment, then let out a sharp laugh of disbelief. ‘I see – you have weighed up your evidence, Bruno, and concluded that I must be the Lincoln killer, because I have the most to protect. Am I right?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Roger Mercer threatened to expose your breach of chastity,’ I said, grasping at facts that had seemed so self-evident a moment ago and now threatened to slip away from me. ‘You wanted him silenced.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not deny that. I mentioned to Jenkes that Roger had been fed ill reports of me and his doubts threatened my safety – I expected Jenkes to have a quiet word in his usual way. But I made a mistake.’ He paused to rake his smooth hair out of his face. ‘Perhaps you know the story of our St Thomas Becket, Bruno – our greatest Archbishop of Canterbury. It is said that King Henry the Second, in a moment of frustration, cried in the presence of his nobles, “Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?” He meant it as a rhetorical question only, but they chose to understand it as an order – consequently Becket was run through with a sword while at prayer, to the king’s horror. That was my mistake. I muttered something similar over poor Roger Mercer, and my faithful servant here’ – he cast a look at Thomas every bit as loaded with scorn as his voice – ‘chose to interpret that in his own way.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I did not hear you object, <em class="calibre2">Father</em>,’ Thomas said quietly. ‘You were pleased to have my help then.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jerome shrugged, unabashed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I do not deny that the thought of sparing myself – and Sophia – the disgrace Roger Mercer had threatened was attractive.’ He turned back to me. ‘But since you seem to have appointed yourself constable and magistrate in this case, Bruno, you should look more closely at your evidence. Thomas is every bit as good a player as I am, Bruno – it seems he had you cozened, at any rate. He may appear harebrained and nervous as a coney, but he is shrewd as the Devil himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas merely returned his stare, his face inscrutable.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He proposed that he would conjure a solution to our difficulty,’ Jerome continued. ‘Those were his words. I accepted his offer and said I wished to know nothing more until it was done. So I had no idea he had persuaded the Nappers to help him steal a dog. I was on my way back from Mass that night when I heard the commotion in the Grove and ran for my longbow. Only then did I learn what an elaborate display he had created.’ He twisted his mouth in distaste.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But why?’ I asked, turning to Thomas as I tried to revise all the conclusions I thought I had made. ‘What made you kill a man in such a manner, when you could not even be certain of the outcome?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Martyrs</em>,’ Thomas spat, as though the very word disgusted him. ‘It is become their obsession. They all wanted to be martyrs for their faith, or at least they claimed they did. The highest glory.’ His voice was rising to a manic pitch; he shook his head in fury. ‘Even my father seeks a martyr’s crown, it seems. What kind of a religion is it, Doctor Bruno, that makes men fall in love with death over life? Where is love, then? Where is human kindness?’</p>
<p class="indented">I could have pointed out that a man who would set a starving hunting dog on his father’s closest friend may not be the best placed to talk of human kindness, but I kept silent. Thomas gestured at Sophia. ‘To have the love of a woman like Sophia, the prospect of new life in her womb –’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thomas!’ Sophia cried, stepping forward, but Jerome held out a hand to restrain her.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But this – <em class="calibre2">creature</em> –’ Thomas exploded, stabbing a finger at Jerome – ‘throws it all aside, he saves all his desire for the executioner’s blade!’ His pointing finger trembled with pent-up passion. ‘Well then, let them try martyrdom, I thought, see how they like it. The rector had just given a sermon on the death of St Ignatius. The teeth of wild beasts. It seemed as good a way as any to send Roger to meet his God.’ He produced a strange, high-pitched laugh that chilled my blood. ‘After the pain my father suffered for his sake, it was the least he deserved.’</p>
<p class="indented">An unnerving silence followed this outburst as the echo of his words died away. Sophia, Jerome and I stared at Thomas in rapt horror for a moment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And with every member of the college under increasing scrutiny, I was afraid my cover would be at risk. Which was your intention all along, was it not, my friend?’ Jerome added softly, raising his head to look at Thomas, who only continued to return his stare, unblinking. I watched them both, still feeling all my nerves taut as a bowstring; I didn’t know if Thomas was more disturbing when he was pulsing with manic energy or in this strange new stillness, as if he were a cat waiting to pounce.</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you went to Mercer’s room to get your hands on those papers before Thomas did?’ I asked, turning back to Jerome. He made a brief, impatient movement with his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I had no idea that Thomas knew about them. After Mercer threatened to expose me, I knew I would always be vulnerable while those letters – all Edmund Allen’s correspondence with Rheims about my mission, and the <em class="calibre2">Regnans in Excelsis</em> Bull – were not in my own hands. But I barely had time to search his room before I saw you through the window, crossing the courtyard towards the tower staircase. I had to hide myself up on the roof of the tower before you came in. That was when I knew your true business in the college.’ He nodded significantly, planting his hands on his hips.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I had no <em class="calibre2">business</em>,’ I said, my heart pummelling at my ribs, ‘other than an interest in finding out how a man could have met such a horrific death – an interest none of his colleagues seemed to share. I only wanted to find some clue as to who he planned to meet and why he carried a full purse.’</p>
<p class="indented">Jerome cast his eyes down, his face guilty.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thomas asked only that I lure Mercer to the Grove that morning. I had told him I felt I should return to France in the circumstances. I asked him to meet me to return some of the money he held for me on behalf of the mission so that I could travel.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But then what of Coverdale?’ I asked, looking from Jerome to Thomas. ‘Did he also find out about Sophia?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You had better ask Thomas about Coverdale,’ Jerome said, setting his jaw.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That snake,’ Thomas whispered, his soft voice making me jump after his long silence. ‘Coverdale petitioned the rector for my removal from the college. He feared I knew too much and thought I would betray them out of revenge. The rector at least had some compassion and let me stay on, but it was Coverdale’s fault that I lost my scholarship and had to depend on <em class="calibre2">his</em> charity.’ He jerked his head towards Jerome. ‘Well, James Coverdale learned what revenge looked like. He was ever a coward – he cried like a girl child when I showed him the razor, and pissed himself.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you decided to make a martyr of him too, because you despised his faith?’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas smiled, looking at me from the corner of his eye like a child caught out in some mischief.</p>
<p class="indented">‘When Jerome sent me to take his longbow and arrows to the strongroom, I had the idea of St Sebastian. I thought if the deaths looked like a pattern, it would frighten them even more. I asked Doctor Coverdale if I could speak privately with him later and he told me he would arrange to leave the disputation early. He feared I had come to bargain with him, but he never expected what happened next.’ He was hugging himself tightly, rocking slightly, his mouth wide in a silent laugh. ‘I needed those letters too, and I knew where to find them. That room used to be my father’s, remember? I thought if I could put them into the right hands, <em class="calibre2">he</em> would be finished.’ He pointed again at Jerome with a flourish.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But I don’t understand,’ I said. ‘If you wanted to expose Jerome, why not just tell the rector what you knew, long before this? You could have saved two innocent lives.’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas gave me a scathing look.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And lose my own? I took you for a clever man, Doctor Bruno. I was dependent on him – don’t you see that? I could do nothing until I was assured of another place by some means. And perhaps you do not know the laws of our land. To aid, comfort or maintain a Jesuit is a felony, punishable by death. To live as his servant, to take his shilling to maintain his disguise – what is that if not aiding? And if the law did not kill me, that whoreson Jenkes would have done it first if I betrayed Gabriel. <em class="calibre2">Gabriel</em> – ha! He even took the name of an archangel – is that not hubris?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The face of an angel,’ I murmured, echoing Humphrey Pritchard’s words. ‘But if someone <em class="calibre2">else</em> were to discover him, then you could not be implicated. All you had to do was point them in the right direction, with your quotations and your diagrams.’ I let the words hang in the air. Thomas only looked at me, his teeth grinding together unconsciously. ‘And poor Ned? Did he also betray your father?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Ned</em>?’ Sophia, who until now had been listening to Thomas’s confessions with an expression of increasing horror, suddenly reached out and clutched Jerome’s arm. ‘Little Ned Lacy, the bible-clerk? He is not dead too?’</p>
<p class="indented">I nodded grimly, watching Thomas. Sophia pressed her hands over her face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He saw me with Sophia in the library while everyone was at the disputation, before I went to Coverdale’s room,’ Thomas said, with a shrug. ‘I was trying to persuade her not to run away with Jerome.’ His brow creased briefly and he rubbed his eyes. ‘Then I saw you giving Ned money, I didn’t know what to do. If he had not come back early, he would not be dead. It was his own fault.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you couldn’t resist visiting a martyrdom on him as well?’ I said, my revulsion growing as I watched his apparent coldness. Thomas smiled slowly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was a way of punishing the rector. Didn’t you always say, Sophia, that your father loved Foxe’s book more than his family? I swore I would make him hate that book. For you,’ he added, turning to her with shining eyes. ‘It was all for you. One day you will see that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Enough!’ Sophia cried, her voice thick with emotion. ‘Enough talking, all of you – it is almost full daylight and no doubt they will have the watch out looking for me by now. We must leave, Jerome. What’s done is done, and it will all be for nothing if we do not get away while we can.’ She pulled urgently at his sleeve.</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas suddenly sprang to life as if a fire had been lit under him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will not go to your death, Sophia,’ he breathed, planting his feet firmly and fixing her with his furious gaze, his trembling hand still pointed at Jerome. ‘You think he will take you safe to France? Five years of training and the best part of his inheritance he has given to this mission – you really believe he will give it all up for you? No – he craves the glory of martyrdom like the rest of them. He means for you to meet with an accident at sea.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Your mind is addled, Thomas,’ Jerome began, taking a step towards him, his hand held out in a placatory gesture. Thomas sprang away.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But I will not let that happen,’ he cried, his voice high and strangulated, ‘and if you will not heed my warning—’</p>
<p class="indented">He left the threat unspoken as, instead, he pulled the razor from under his cloak and, in the same movement, lunged at Jerome. I slipped Humphrey’s knife from my belt but the Jesuit was soundly trained; before I could move, he had pushed Sophia behind him and aimed a kick at Thomas’s outstretched arm. Thomas lost balance for a moment, though he did not drop the razor, but his slip gave Jerome the chance to bend and pull a knife from the side of his boot. Both circled warily, facing one another, eyes locked and weapons drawn, while Sophia stifled a scream and I hovered uselessly at the edge of this duel, wondering how I might intervene. But I did not have the chance; at that moment the door burst open and the servant, Barton, ran into the room, his poker held aloft; Thomas wheeled around with blazing eyes and, faster than you could blink, slashed wildly at the man’s arm with his razor before he could strike. Barton howled and dropped the poker, clutching at his wound, and Thomas, seemingly crazed, leapt upon him and slashed at his neck with the razor over and over again; I threw myself at Thomas, wrapping myself around his back and pulling at his arm but he was surprisingly strong for such a wiry boy, and it seemed his fury had lent him supernatural strength. He attempted to shake me off, but I was unable to restrain him and Barton’s last guttural cries were drowned by Sophia’s screams as his lifeblood gushed from the open wound over the brick floor and his dying breath faded as he clutched at Thomas’s cloak and then slumped to the ground.</p>
<p class="indented">I let go of Thomas and turned, expecting to find Sophia hysterical from the scene she had just witnessed, but I saw that in the confusion Jerome had seized her from behind and was now holding her with one arm hooked around her chest, his knife pointed at the soft white skin of her throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Put the razor down, Thomas,’ he said, slowly and clearly, again sounding as calm as if he were a schoolmaster addressing a room full of mischievous boys. Thomas only stared slack-jawed, his face, arms and hands sprayed with the servant’s blood, then he took a step forward and Jerome jerked the knife closer to Sophia’s neck; she bit back a cry and squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her head with tiny movements.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let her go,’ I said, trying to match Jerome’s tone of calm authority.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Let her go? Or what will you do, Bruno?’ He kept the knife tilted at her throat, regarding me as if I were a tiresome distraction. ‘Did you bring reinforcements?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No one knows I am here,’ I said, not knowing if I spoke the truth. If Cobbett’s messenger had managed to get the bundle of papers to Sidney, would he gather some men and come to look for me at Hazeley Court? How long would it take them to arrive, if he did? But the chance that Slythurst had let any messenger leave the college unhindered was tiny.</p>
<p class="indented">As if reading my mind, Jerome shook his head impatiently.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, no matter. They will be too late. Once and for all, throw your weapons down on the floor or your quest will have been in vain.’ He lifted the elbow of the arm that held the knife, as if to plunge it; Thomas gave me a brief glance, then cast his razor on to the floor in front of him, where it clattered in the silence until it became still. I looked at Sophia, who had opened her eyes now and was watching me with an expression of mingled despair, fear and disbelief, then I too threw down my knife.</p>
<p class="indented">Jerome nodded.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good. Now you will stay here and keep quiet, before anyone else gets hurt.’ He was manoeuvring Sophia towards the door that led to the western tower staircase, his knife held in place at her neck. Roughly he wrestled her forward, kicking the door shut behind him; as it swung, Thomas gave a cry of rage and ran at the doorway.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You will not succeed,’ Thomas cried in ragged breaths, racing to follow them; to my surprise, Jerome was forcing Sophia up the stairs instead of down, and as Thomas reached them Jerome kicked out and caught him on the jaw, making him fall back into me, his mouth bleeding.</p>
<p class="indented">Undeterred, he picked himself up and launched himself on to the narrow staircase, trying to grab at Jerome’s heels as Jerome tried to kick back at him, while I followed close behind, pausing only to pick up my knife from the floor. Somewhere above us, echoing from the curving stone, we suddenly heard Sophia scream as if at a sharp pain, and I slapped at Thomas’s ankle from below.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He has a knife at her back,’ I hissed. ‘For God’s sake, do nothing hasty.’</p>
<p class="indented">The climb was relentless; at one point I thought I heard Sophia cry, ‘I cannot,’ and Jerome answer, ‘Trust me,’ but the voices were muffled by the echoes. My battered legs began to tremble as we climbed higher, intermittently passing small cruciform windows that offered views over the manor’s parkland and forest, and still Jerome forced Sophia upwards, and we followed, until I felt a draught of chill air on my face and understood that he was leading us to the very battlements of the tower. My stomach convulsed slightly as I tried to imagine what he might have in mind, and whether all four of us would return alive.</p>
<p class="indented">I emerged through a low doorway behind Thomas on to a platform perhaps twelve feet wide, enclosed by eight crenellated walls the height of a man’s chest. Beyond them I could see the carriage drive and the cart track by which I had approached the house, the woods that bordered the path spread out far below us like a green canopy and, behind them, the line of distant blue hills, their peaks misted in the early light. At this height, more than a hundred feet above the ground, the wind was shrill in my ears, slicing across the roof of the tower. On the far side, Jerome once again held Sophia at the point of his knife, his hair whipping over his face. He beckoned to Thomas with his eyes.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Come, then, Thomas,’ he called, ‘will you save her?’</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas hesitated a moment and I saw his body stiffen as he gathered his resolve, perhaps trying to judge how quickly he could move compared to Jerome. Sophia whimpered softly, her eyes flicking wildly from Thomas to me to the man whose arms now held her close, not for the first time, but now with very different intent; from the confusion and terror in her expression I could tell that she did not know if Jerome was serious or play-acting to trap Thomas. I reached out a hand to restrain Thomas, but in that moment he made up his mind and threw himself once again at his former master, bending to hurl his full weight at Jerome’s midriff. The priest, pushing Sophia roughly to the ground, tried to stick Thomas with his knife, but Thomas twisted aside at the crucial moment, grabbing Jerome’s raised arm in mid-air. For a moment their two arms were raised aloft in the shape of an arch, locked together and trembling with the force of their opposing efforts, the knife flashing silver as it twisted in the air. Then Thomas jerked a knee sharply upwards into Jerome’s groin; the priest yelped and doubled over, the tension in his arm momentarily lost, and in that second’s lapse Thomas bit him hard on the wrist, causing him to drop the knife. But before Thomas could pick it up, Jerome had grasped him by the hair, yanked his head back and punched him hard in the face. Thomas attempted to hit back, blood coursing down his nose, but Jerome caught him again with a fist hard in the jaw and Thomas stumbled backwards, dangerously close to the parapet.</p>
<p class="indented">Sophia had wriggled away to the shelter of the wall; I crouched beside her and motioned to the stairway, but she shook her head, her eyes glassy with fear and still riveted on the life-or-death struggle before us. Slowly, so as not to attract attention, I reached out and scrabbled Jerome’s fallen knife towards my hand, keeping my eyes on the fighting pair all the time. Thomas, now badly bruised and bleeding, mustered one last burst of energy and thrust a hand forward to grip Jerome around the throat; Jerome, his face contorted with rage, let go of Thomas’s hair and clamped both his hands around the boy’s neck. They swayed together in this oddly intimate dance, matching one another’s steps, now one pushing forward, now the other, both choking and gasping through gritted teeth until it seemed that both must expire in the same moment, so fierce and determined were their crimson faces, when Jerome, who had the advantage of weight and strength, managed to force Thomas a few steps further back, into a gap between the battlements. Thomas felt the wall against his back and appeared to tighten his hold on Jerome’s neck; Jerome leant all his weight forward, pushing Thomas so that he was hanging backwards through the gap, and for a moment I thought both would fall to their deaths together, when suddenly Sophia leapt to her feet, grabbed Jerome’s knife from my hand before I realised what she was doing, and ran across to the fighting pair where she stabbed the knife, just once, into Thomas’s right hand, still clamped fast around Jerome’s throat.</p>
<p class="indented">Thomas cried out and released his grip involuntarily; in the same moment Jerome also let go of Thomas’s throat and, bracing himself against the brick parapet, gave Thomas one almighty shove in the chest. With a harrowing scream, the boy flailed for a moment, his hands grasping furiously at nothing, before he toppled backwards and vanished from our sight, that terrible last cry echoing fainter and fainter as he fell seven tiers to the waiting ground. The impact was so dull we barely heard it from the roof; I wanted to lean over and look but kept my distance from the parapet, afraid to turn my back on Jerome. Sophia collapsed into his arms, sobbing and shaking violently. Gently he prised the knife from her fingers and rested his chin on the top of her head, breathing hard in ragged gasps. He looked across at me, the fury drained from his face and in its place only a bone-deep exhaustion. He rubbed his throat and twisted his neck from side to side as if to ease the pain.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It had to come sooner or later,’ he croaked, his voice barely audible. ‘He would have been found out eventually, and then he would have taken me down with him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘We have killed him,’ Sophia sobbed, raising her tear-streaked face from Jerome’s shoulder. ‘Oh, God – we have killed him! Poor Thomas – he was my only friend once. Will God ever forgive us his blood?’ She looked up to the sky, now streaked with bands of blue, the worst of the rain clouds scurrying away toward the horizon.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He killed three men, Sophia,’ Jerome said hoarsely, still rubbing his throat. ‘He would have killed me. We are fighting a Holy War, remember. To kill those who oppose God’s kingdom is not murder.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is that what they teach you at Rheims?’ I asked, recovering myself and moving towards the stairs. Now that Jerome was in possession of his knife again I realised how vulnerable I was. I fervently did not want to follow Thomas over the parapet, but it was clear that Sophia could not be counted upon to act against Jerome, and I could not see that there was any chance he might let me walk free.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And what of Sophia?’ I added. ‘Would it have been murder to have her killed before she reached France? Is she in the way of God’s kingdom?’</p>
<p class="indented">Jerome laughed abruptly, wincing as the effort hurt his bruised throat.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You saw for yourself how troubled that boy’s mind was, Doctor Bruno. Once he had dirtied his hands with murder, he began to believe the rest of the world was also bent on killing. He was deluded to the very end.’</p>
<p class="indented">He took a step towards me, but before I could reach the stairs I collided with a body; whipping around, I saw that the doorway was blocked by two solid-looking servants in household livery. One of them, a burly man who was a good foot taller than me, grasped my arm and twisted it up behind my back, sending bursts of white-hot pain through my shoulder. This time I offered no resistance. I was not going to fight my way out of this, I realised. It seemed that unless the Jesuit was willing to show mercy, I had very little hope.</p>
