<h2 class="chapter-number"><a class="link" href="part0002.html#chapter005">FIVE</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left">Relieved of my last duty of care to poor Roger Mercer by the arrival of the coroner, who came accompanied by the bustling figure of Doctor James Coverdale – the latter hardly bothering to disguise his self-importance in being asked to officiate over the removal of his one-time rival – I left the Grove gratefully and hurried through the passageway to the main courtyard. Chapel was over and groups of undergraduates in their billowing gowns stood about in animated discussion, many of them apparently thrilled to be so near to such calamity, even as they pressed hands to their mouths and opened their eyes wide in horror.</p>
<p class="indented">It was only just seven o’clock but I felt I had been awake most of the night; I wanted nothing more than to return to my chamber, change my clothes and try to recoup some of the sleep I lacked, before attempting to order my mind in time for the evening’s disputation – an event which held little savour for me now. My shirt and breeches were stained with Mercer’s blood, a fact Coverdale had taken pleasure in pointing out as I took my leave of him and the coroner. ‘You’d better find some clean clothes, Doctor Bruno,’ he had said, with a levity that seemed out of place, ‘or people will think you the killer!’</p>
<p class="indented">I surmised that he was displeased to find me already on the scene, and had made an idle joke to puncture any illusion of my usefulness, but as I glanced around the courtyard at the scene of excited consternation, I wondered why he had used the word ‘killer’, even in jest, if it had been given out officially that the sub-rector’s death was a tragic accident? Perhaps I was giving undue weight to thoughtless words; in any event, he was right about my clothes, I thought, looking down at my breeches and holding the fabric out to see the extent of the bloodstains. As I did so, I felt something in the pocket and realised that I was still carrying the keys I had taken from Mercer’s body; I must have tucked them away in my own breeches without thinking.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned the key-ring over in my palm; the smaller key, I guessed, must open the door of the sub-rector’s chamber, since it was a similar size to the key I had been given for my own guest room. I glanced around the courtyard again. The students were beginning to disperse, books in hand, some towards the staircase that led to the library in the north range, others towards the main gate; no one paid me any attention. I looked at Mercer’s key. Might his room not hold some indication of who he had expected to meet in the garden, I wondered, and why he had taken so much money? I could take a quick look now, while the students were occupied, and return the keys to the rector later, claiming (truthfully) that I had pocketed them inadvertently.</p>
<p class="indented">Mercer had mentioned that he lived in the tower room above the main entrance. I glanced up at the tall perpendicular arches of the first-storey windows, presuming this must be the right place, then with a confident step I passed into the shadow of the first staircase on the west range that appeared to lead up into the tower.</p>
<p class="indented">Reaching the first landing, I arrived at a low wooden door bearing a painted sign that read Doctor R. Mercer, Sub-Rector. After a fleeting glance to either side, I tried the key in the lock. It turned easily, and I slipped quietly into the room Roger Mercer had left only two hours earlier, never imagining he would not return. For a moment I thought I heard light footsteps quickening away overhead; I froze, my ears straining, but I heard no door open or close and there was no further sound.</p>
<p class="indented">I had not anticipated the sight that greeted me as I gently pressed the door shut behind me. The room was in turmoil: books, papers and maps pulled from shelves and flung in every direction with no care for their contents, garments pulled from chests and strewn across the floor. A thick tapestry rug that must have covered the floor was rucked up and pulled to one side, and marks in the dust suggested that someone had tried to prise a floorboard out of place. Either Mercer had left in a great hurry after ransacking his room for some lost object, or someone else was also searching for something connected with his death and had got here before me.</p>
<p class="indented">The room was long with a high ceiling and stretched the width of the range, the narrow leaded windows overlooking the quadrangle on one side and the street outside on the other. On the street side was a wide brick fireplace and, opposite, a large oak desk with delicately carved legs. At the far end, facing the door, were three steps leading up to another doorway, which stood open. Sweat prickled on my palms for an instant as I held my breath and listened for any sound other than the frantic pumping of my own blood as I remembered the footsteps I had heard; perhaps they had not come from the storey above, and someone was still in the room. Stepping as carefully as a cat, I grabbed the nearest thing the study offered to a weapon – an iron poker from the grate – and clutched it in both hands along with my courage as I tensed myself to approach the open door. I stepped through, raising the poker – but the small room, inside the tower itself, contained nothing more than a plain truckle-bed, a washstand and a heavy oak wardrobe with carved panels in the doors.</p>
<p class="indented">This little bedchamber had not been spared the searcher’s attentions: sheets were roughly torn from the bed, an earthenware jug had been knocked from the washstand and broken in pieces, leaving a damp stain on the rushes that covered the floor. As I drew closer I saw that even the straw mattress had been slashed with a knife, its stuffing spilling out over the bed. In the corner of this square room was a small wooden door set into the wall. I tried the handle but it was firmly locked, though there was a hollow sound when I knocked on the wood; here, I presumed from the echo and the draught that whistled from the cracks, was the staircase to the upper floor of the tower. Gripping the poker, I checked behind the heavy window drapes and under the bed, but found no one; satisfied that I was alone, I returned to the main room and quietly locked the door behind me so that I could examine the scene in peace.</p>
<p class="indented">Where to begin amid such chaos? The room was crammed with furniture of assorted sizes and shapes, all made from good oak. Chairs had been turned over, a trunk dragged across the floor and forced open to reveal a cache of books. The apparent desperation of the searcher proved beyond any doubt that he believed there was something of significance to be found among Mercer’s possessions; the question was whether it had already been found, and whether I would know it if I saw it.</p>
<p class="indented">I turned to the handsome writing desk, now littered with papers and quills. A little brass astrolabe had been knocked to the floor in the frenzy; I bent to retrieve it and set it back on its stand, but its rule was broken. As I crouched I noticed a dark curling object under the desk; its shape was unusual, but when I reached to pick it up and brought it into the light, I saw that it was only a length of orange peel, long dried out, and threw it back to the floor. Lifting one or two of the top sheets, I skimmed the papers on the desk; it would be painstaking work to sift through the mass of leaves piled up there for any letter or jotting that might shed light on the former occupant’s death. All the drawers of the desk had been pulled out; I reached into each one, feeling along the underside for any catches that would release secret compartments, but found nothing. I lifted out contents of the drawers abandoned in disarray, but already I felt daunted by the task; I had no idea what I hoped to find.</p>
<p class="indented">From the top left-hand drawer I withdrew a fine leather writing-case and briefly tensed with hope, thinking that perhaps Mercer’s most recent correspondence might still be within and might reveal who he had lately fallen out with or any transactions that could explain his presence in the garden. I cleared a space on the desk for the case and, as I opened it, a thin, cloth-bound book fell out. Picking it up, I opened it at random and saw that it was a printed almanac for the year 1583, the pages marked into divisions for the days of the week, the month marked at the top of each page and annotated with the relevant astrological predictions. My pulse racing in my throat, I flicked hastily through to the page for today’s date, wondering if there was the slightest chance he might have noted whom he had planned to meet this morning.</p>
<p class="indented">As I searched for the page marked 22nd May, I noticed an oddity about this calendar: each division was marked with two dates, one printed in black, the second marked in by hand in red ink. The red date was ten days ahead of the black. I knew immediately what this meant, because my host the French ambassador worked from such calendars in the embassy: the red number showed the date according to the new calendar introduced the previous October by Pope Gregory, now mandatory in the Catholic states by order of the Papal Bull <em class="calibre2">Inter gravissimas</em>. In a marked act of defiance to papal authority, it had not been adopted by England and the other Protestant countries of Europe, and I had often heard the ambassador complaining that it made correspondence between the officials of different countries extremely confusing because no one was quite sure which date was meant; usually he would use both, just to be sure. But why, I wondered, would an English Protestant like Roger Mercer need a calendar marked with the Gregorian dates?</p>
<p class="indented">I found the page I wanted and was moved to see that on 22nd May (1st June) he had written the time and place of my disputation in his elegant, sloping hand: <em class="calibre2">G. Bruno vs Underhill, Div. Sch. 5</em>, it read. Then, holding the book closer, I noticed another mark for today’s date; in the top left-hand corner of the day’s division there was a solitary letter J. I blinked in disbelief. Could J be the initial of the person he had arranged to meet? That could certainly narrow it down. I scoured recent dates for any other clues. The previous day, the 21st (31st) was marked only with a curious symbol, a circle with spokes like the wheel of a cart. Flicking back through the book, I noticed this symbol appeared on other pages at regular intervals; more or less once every ten days, though never on the same day of the week. It might have been a code, but I had no way of deciphering it. The J, though, did at least seem a concrete clue.</p>
<p class="indented">But as I had held the book up to my nose, I had noticed something else: a faint smell of oranges. I thought at first that it came from my own fingers, having picked up the peel from the floor, but as I sniffed I realised that the smell was coming from the almanac itself. Perhaps that was not unusual; if Roger Mercer liked to eat oranges, it was possible that he had spread the juice to the pages of his books; he had not been the most fastidious eater, as I had noted the night before. But something nagged at my mind, and as I sniffed the book again I suddenly cursed myself for being so stupid.</p>
<p class="indented">At that moment, the wardrobe door creaked a little further on its worn hinge, making me jump almost out of my boots; instinctively I hid the book inside my shirt, tucked into the waist of my breeches, and whipped around, but the door appeared to have moved under its own weight. Opening it right up, I saw at first only heaps of cloth, half pulled out by the hasty searcher, and then I made out a squat dark shape pushed up against the back of the closet, covered by an old blanket. When this was yanked away, it revealed a small wooden chest bound with iron bands and fastened with a sturdy padlock. Reaching in, I dragged the object into the light, but it tilted and landed with a resounding thud as it dropped between the ledge of the wardrobe and the floor. I paused, my breath held tight in my throat, to see if the noise had alerted anyone to my presence in the room, but all was silent. As the chest fell, I had heard unmistakeably the metallic clink of coins. So this was Roger Mercer’s strongbox, his treasury, plainly full of gold. He had not taken much trouble to conceal it, and yet it had been left untouched by whoever had laid waste to his room.</p>
<p class="indented">This fitted with the full purse left on Roger’s body; it seemed clear that whoever had killed him was not interested in taking money. But why else does a man kill, if not for money? Either for revenge, I thought, or because he fears the victim may do him harm. I decided I would have to visit the porter, Cobbett, and see what he could tell me of the college’s system of gates and locks; the person who had turned this room upside down had evidently let himself in with a key and locked the room again behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">As I crouched beside the trunk brooding on the matter of keys, I heard the undeniable click of the lock in the room behind me turning smoothly and my heart almost froze in my chest. There was no time to hide; all I could do was watch helplessly as the door slid open just wide enough to admit the lanky figure of Walter Slythurst, the bursar. I watched as his gaze slowly swept the tumult of the room with incredulity before eventually coming to rest on me. There was even a brief pause as his brain struggled to process the evidence of his ferrety eyes, before he gave a little cry and stared at me as if I were an apparition.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Almighty God!’ he exclaimed. ‘You! What the Devil –?’</p>
<p class="indented">It was going to take a quite exceptional feat of invention to explain why I had locked myself into the recently ransacked room of a newly dead man and was now cradling his strongbox in my blood-soaked lap. I took a deep breath and affected nonchalance.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Buongiorno</em>, Master Slythurst.’</p>
<p class="indented">Slythurst’s face, all planes and angles, was made for sneering cynicism rather than purple rage, but at this moment he appeared to swell up to a point where he could barely formulate his own language.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What …?’ he began, before his gathered breath escaped in a squeaking hiss, and he inhaled for the next attempt, ‘what <em class="calibre2">is</em> this?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am assisting the rector,’ I explained, exaggerating my accent, which I had found in the past to be a useful cover for apparently eccentric behaviour; people put it down to the oddities of a foreigner. ‘I was with him this morning, we were the first to arrive at the scene of the terrible misfortune. And the clothes, you see, were badly destroyed, so I have come to find some replacements in which to dress the poor body of Doctor Mercer for his final rest.’ I assumed a pious expression; never had I uttered so unconvincing a lie. In his place, I would not have believed me for a moment.</p>
<p class="indented">Slythurst narrowed his eyes until they were mere slits below his thin brows.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I see. And did you have some trouble finding them?’ The sweep of his hand mockingly took in the destruction that had been visited on the room.</p>
<p class="indented">His tone could have withered the spring leaves from the trees. I returned his look of contempt as levelly as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The room is as I discovered it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then why did you lock the door?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Force of habit.’ I laughed self-consciously. ‘Foolish, I know – but in Italy I lived for many years often in fear for my life. The places I travelled, you never left a door open behind you. Even now, this is something I do from pure instinct, I do not even notice that I am doing so.’</p>
<p class="indented">He appeared to consider the likelihood of this for a moment, then folded his arms as if to underline his distrust of me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Where did you get the key?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was the set Doctor Mercer had with him. When the coroner arrived, I came here to see how I might help.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Hm.’ Slythurst stepped forward and made a perfunctory assessment of the papers scattered across the desk. ‘I am here, by the way, to make an inventory of personal effects to be returned to the family,’ he added, not looking at me.</p>
<p class="indented">It was clear that he was lying, particularly since, as an official of the college, he was not obliged to explain his business to me. I rose and faced him, taking care not to let the book slip out from under my shirt; he turned, arms still folded, and we squared up to each other, each knowing the other had an unspoken intent but not quite daring to make an outright challenge. I wondered briefly if we might both be searching for the same thing, before remembering that I did not know what I was searching for, only whatever might help to explain Mercer’s presence in the garden. But were Slythurst and whoever had turned over the room before I arrived looking for the same item? I studied his pale, almost hairless face with distaste as he glared back at me with equal contempt. Could he have been the original ransacker of the room, disturbed in his first attempt and now returned to pick up where he left off? I doubted it; I had seen his expression when he first opened the door and the chaos had shocked him as much as it had me, I was sure. So more than one person believed that something they wanted was hidden in the dead man’s room.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What is that?’ Slythurst eventually broke the silence by pointing to the chest at my feet.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I believe it is Doctor Mercer’s strongbox.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And what were you doing with it?’ His words were as pointed as if he had etched them on glass.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was inside the wardrobe. I thought it might contain items of clothing, so I lifted it out to take a look.’</p>
<p class="indented">Once again he gave me a look from under his eyelids such as you might give a market-place urchin who tries to steal your bread.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are covered in gore, Doctor Bruno,’ he remarked, his eyes flicking back to the desk.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I tried to help a man who was bleeding to death,’ I replied quietly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You simply cannot be helpful enough, can you?’ He strode across to the doorway of the small bedchamber and glanced past me. ‘Have you been up the staircase?’ he asked, gesturing brusquely to the small inner door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That door is locked,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Locked?’ He looked puzzled. ‘Curious.’</p>
<p class="indented">He crossed to the door and tried it himself, as if to prove that he would not accept my word on anything. There was another uncomfortable silence; I knew he was waiting for me to leave and I was reluctant to abandon the room in case whatever he and the other searcher wanted was still there to be found. But I could not plausibly prolong my presence there, so I gave a terse bow.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, I will leave you to your sad task, Master Slythurst.’</p>
<p class="indented">He only nodded, but as I reached the door, he called,</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno – have you not forgotten something?’</p>
<p class="indented">I thought for a moment he meant the keys, and was expecting me to hand them over to him. I looked at him, uncomprehending, as a smile of satisfaction cut across his face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The clothes? To dress the body?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Of course.’ Hastily I ran back to the wardrobe and gathered an armful of garments without stopping to look at them, aware that my pitiful lie had now collapsed entirely.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m sure the rector will be most grateful for your assistance,’ Slythurst said pleasantly, holding the door open for me as I struggled out with the unwanted clothes. As I passed, he hissed, ‘I shall be watching you, Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">I offered him my most charming smile in return as I passed through. Moments later I heard the sound of a key turning smoothly in the lock.</p>
<p class="flush-left">Returning to the courtyard I caught sight of Gabriel Norris, now more soberly dressed in a suit of black and a plain gown, which made his good looks stand out all the more. He stood at the entrance to the west range stairway on the other side of the tower and appeared to be regaling a group of fellow students with tales of his heroism; one hand was held out flat at chest height, a vastly exaggerated account of the dog’s size, and I could not help smiling to myself at the bravado of the young. He spotted me and broke off mid-sentence, looking with some suspicion at the bundle of Mercer’s clothes in my arms and then at the entrance from which I had just emerged.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What, has the looting begun already, Doctor Bruno?’ he called, a little too jovially.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am assisting the rector,’ I repeated, since it seemed this defence could not be contradicted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah.’ He nodded and, leaving his friends, sauntered over to me. At close quarters I noticed that he seemed older than the boys who now stood waiting for him; I would have guessed his age at twenty-five or more. ‘That was a bit of excitement we had this morning, was it not?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m not sure that’s the word I would use.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No – no, of course.’ He assumed a solemn expression. ‘I meant only – Oxford life is usually so uneventful, and now we have a royal visitation and a tragedy all at once, we hardly know which to talk about first.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You were very level-headed this morning,’ I said. ‘I don’t think I would have had such a steady arm in the heat of the moment. It is lucky you are a good shot.’</p>
<p class="indented">Norris inclined his head, acknowledging the compliment.</p>
<p class="indented">‘My father taught me to hunt as a boy,’ he said. ‘I only wish I could have been quick enough to save Doctor Mercer.’ He rubbed the back of his hand across his brow; I suspected that, under all his swaggering, the experience had shaken him profoundly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you know him well?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘He has been my tutor since Doctor Allen was deprived last year.’ A strange expression crossed his face, as if he were struggling to master some emotion. ‘We were close, I suppose. I respected him, in any case.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That was a hunting dog that killed him, was it not?’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Irish wolfhound. Very efficient hunters – always go straight in to break the neck, you know,’ he said in a brisker tone, pleased to display his knowledge. Then he frowned. ‘But it is usually a gentle dog, too – people keep them as pets. They’re not so unpredictable in temperament as, say, a mastiff – they rarely attack unless they have been trained to do so.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was starving, though – did you not see the scrawny state of it?’</p>
<p class="indented">He nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Must have been a stray – I suppose if it was desperate for meat it would savage the first living creature it found.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is it not unusual that a stray wolfhound should be roaming the streets of Oxford at night?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">He looked at me curiously, as if he found my questions odd, but shrugged.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There is hunting in the royal forest of Shotover, to the east of the city – you can hire dogs from the keeper there for a day’s hunt. Some of the commoners go from time to time when we have permission. Perhaps one of their dogs got loose and wandered into the city.’ He sounded as if he had lost interest in the subject, and looked around to check that his group of admirers was still waiting. ‘Well, Doctor Bruno – I must collect my books and get along to lectures. I hope this morning’s adventure will not mar your stay in Oxford too badly.’ He bowed briefly and made to enter the staircase.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You have a room in there?’ I asked, gesturing with my thumb.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s right,’ he said, carelessly. ‘One of the best in the college. I share it with my servant, Thomas.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then,’ I glanced across the courtyard at the passages that led either side of the hall to the garden, calculating the distance. ‘You must have exceptional hearing to have been woken by the commotion from the Grove, when these rooms are the furthest away from it.’</p>
<p class="indented">He regarded me for a moment with a closed expression, then stepped towards me, taking my elbow, and leaned in with a confidential whisper.</p>
<p class="indented">‘There you have me, Doctor Bruno – I will confess that I was not abed when I heard the noise, but please let that be a confidence between us.’</p>
<p class="indented">I raised an eyebrow; he gave me a knowing nudge in the ribs, from which I was presumably supposed to infer some manly nocturnal pursuit. In such an intimate stance it was clear that he had no smell of drink on him, and a man who had been carousing all night could not have had such a steady hand as I had witnessed with the bow and arrow; I guessed, then, that he had been bedding some woman and was secretly pleased to share the triumph. That at least would account for his ridiculous garb at that hour of the morning, I thought.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I had spent the night away from college – you understand my meaning, I’m sure,’ he said, with a wink, ‘and on my return I was passing along St Mildred’s Lane by Jesus College when I heard the frenzied barking of that dog and those dreadful cries. I realised it was coming from the Grove and ran straightways for my bow and then to the gate, where I found you all gathered, looking on.’</p>
<p class="indented">The reproach stung, so I countered with one of my own.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you not try the gate from Brasenose Lane? You might have arrived sooner.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But I don’t have a key to that gate,’ he said, puzzled. ‘Only the senior Fellows do. I was not to know it had been left open – the Fellows treat that Grove as if it were sacred. I acted as quickly as I could, Doctor Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And did you see anyone near the college walls as you approached?’ I asked, as lightly as I could.</p>
<p class="indented">Norris tilted his head, considering.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Now that you mention it – at one point I thought I heard footsteps up ahead, running, but the sound was lost in the din from the garden and in all that followed I forgot all about it. Why do you ask?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I only wondered if many people were abroad at that time of day,’ I said, turning to go. ‘I should really take these to the rector.’</p>
<p class="indented">He eyed me curiously for some moments, before clapping me on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We are all looking forward to your disputation this evening. I don’t care much for cosmology either way, but I shall applaud you if you can make the rector look a fool. Although I imagine he will do that quite efficiently by himself.’ He grinned and turned as if to leave, then looked back at me with a serious expression. ‘I suppose you and I shall be called to give account if there is an inquest. There will be trouble for me over the bow and arrows, no doubt – no one is allowed to keep weapons in the university precincts. Perhaps you could mention that the hound could not have been subdued without my intervention, Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will certainly give a true account of events to the best of my ability, if one is requested,’ I replied, bowing in return.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘Thank you. <em class="calibre2">Arrivederci, il mio doctore</em>!’ he cried, turning on his heel and striding swiftly towards the main gate. I watched him walk away, intrigued. Gabriel Norris might be an unbearable peacock, but it would be a mistake to underestimate his sharpness.</p>
<p class="flush-left">I stood in the courtyard, my arms full of Roger Mercer’s clothes, wondering what I should do next. The sun was obscured behind rows of pewter clouds, stretching out in waves over the rooftops like an inverted ocean; I shivered in my thin shirt. Slythurst was sure to tell the rector that I had been found rummaging in the dead man’s room and had even got as far as dragging his money chest from its hiding place; the only way I could hope to protest my innocence was to repeat my ridiculous lie about trying to help out with the clothes. I looked down at the bundle in my arms, garments which still retained the musky smell of their owner’s body, and decided I must take them to the rector as soon as I could, before Slythurst could insinuate anything unpleasant in his ear. I would tell him it was an old Nolan custom to show respect for the dead; he might think me absurd, but I hoped he would not suspect me for a thief. He would also wonder why I had taken the dead man’s keys; these I must return as soon as possible, though I would have liked to keep them in case I had the chance to search the tower room further. But surely Slythurst would have found what he came for by now, if the first ransacker had not.</p>
<p class="indented">My head was swimming; I wanted nothing more than to return to bed and lie down, but I turned again towards the gatehouse and found a door set into the wall of the archway to the right of the vast wooden gate with a painted sign proclaiming the porter’s lodge.</p>
<p class="indented">I peeked around the door; a fat, old man with a brush of wiry grey hair sat beside a wooden table, his head slumped to his chest, breathing heavily. There were beer stains on his jerkin and a tired-looking black dog lay at his feet, its muzzle all peppered with grey. It half raised its head at my footsteps, regarding me through milky eyes, then returned to its sleepy position as if that small effort was as much as it could offer. I cleared my throat and knocked at the same time; the old man’s head jerked upwards in confusion and spittle glistened on his grizzled chin.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Pardon me, sir, must have drifted for a moment there,’ he muttered.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Goodman Cobbett? My name is Giordano Bruno—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know you, sir, you are our honoured guest come to cross swords with the rector tonight – I refer to the swords of words, naturally, for your actual sword is not permitted about the college, sir. And what a dreadful day for you to be here, sir, for such a misfortune as we have had this morning, it hardly bears thinking of.’ He shook his head theatrically and his jowls swung from side to side.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes, I am deeply sorry,’ I said, taking the keys from my pocket. ‘I was there in the Grove assisting the rector – he asked me to see that Doctor Mercer’s keys were safely returned, I presumed he meant to you?’</p>
<p class="indented">The old porter’s face lit up with relief at the sight of the key-ring.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, thank Heaven for that! At least we have one set back. I begin to think keys have legs round these parts.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you not keep a spare?’ I asked, gently easing the door closed behind me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We do, sir, but the spare disappeared from my key cupboard a couple of days ago, which seemed curious at the time, since Doctor Mercer never asked me for it and I am rarely out of the lodge. I thought perhaps the bursar had needed it to get to the strongroom in a hurry – you must go through the sub-rector’s room to access the tower, you see – but he says he knows nothing of it either.’ He shook his head again. ‘The Fellows are worse than the students, if you ask me – forever mislaying keys. They don’t seem to realise new keys cost money.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Do you keep spare keys to all the rooms in the college?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Certainly, sir – I’ll show you.’ The old man heaved himself to his feet, wheezing alarmingly, and lumbered across to a shallow wooden cupboard mounted on the back wall behind his desk. Proudly he flung open both doors to reveal rows of iron keys of assorted shapes and sizes hanging from hooks, each labelled with a combination of letters and numbers.</p>
<p class="indented">‘How do you ever tell which is which?’ I asked innocently.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah,’ Cobbett said, tapping the side of his bulbous scarlet nose. ‘I have a system designed to prevent them falling into the wrong hands, see? If I were to just label them “Tower Room”, “Library” and so on, be too easy for the young ’uns to sneak in and help themselves when I’m sleeping or relieving meself or whatnot. So I made up a code, oh, years ago now. If anyone loses a key they come to me and I find them the spare, but they can’t steal them to get in where they don’t belong to play pranks or what have you.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So you have a complete set of keys to all the doors and gates in the college?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That I do, sir, ’cept when people lose ’em,’ he said darkly. ‘The only ones I don’t have are to the college strongroom. You can only get to it through the sub-rector’s room, as I say, up the tower staircase, and only the rector and the bursar have a key. It is designed that way so that no one person can get into the strongroom without at least one other person present,’ he added.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And only you have keys to the other rooms?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, sir – the rector also keeps a complete set to all the rooms in his lodgings, but he doesn’t hand those out. Students and Fellows alike must come to me, and only me.’ He shuffled back to his chair and regarded me with curiosity.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Does the bursar have a key to the sub-rector’s room?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The bursar?’ Cobbett looked surprised. ‘No, sir – he has his key to the strongroom, but the sub-rector must be present to let him up to the tower. It’s supposed to guard against theft, you see.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But if the sub-rector should be away, and the bursar needs the strongroom?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, then, he would need to come to me or ask the rector to let him up. Why you so interested in keys, anyways?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh – I have only been wondering how a stray dog might have got into the Grove,’ I replied, though I was now also wondering how Slythurst had obtained a key to Roger Mercer’s private chamber. Had he somehow contrived to steal the spare key from Cobbett’s cupboard? And if that was the case, how had the person who first turned over Mercer’s room let himself in? Who had a third key, except the rector?</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah.’ The old porter rubbed his stubbly chin. ‘Well, now – I dare say that was my fault, sir – it must be that I didn’t check the Brasenose Lane gate carefully enough last night.’</p>
<p class="indented">A silence followed; it was clear that the old man was uncomfortable telling a lie that reflected poorly on his competence, and that he was doing so dutifully but reluctantly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I find that hard to believe,’ I said, encouragement in my voice. ‘For everyone tells me you have served the college man and boy and have never neglected your duty.’</p>
<p class="indented">A look of gratitude spread across the porter’s face; he beckoned me closer. I leaned in; his breath was heavy with stale beer.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I thank you, sir – I told the rector, I said, “Sir, you know I will do as you wish, but I hope no one will ever believe old Cobbett left any cranny of this college unchecked on his rounds.” People here know I do my job well, sir.’ He puffed out his great barrel chest and fell to a fit of coughing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, I hope you will not be punished for what is not your fault,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you, sir, you are kind.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Tell me, Goodman Cobbett,’ I said casually, turning to go, ‘if a man ever wanted to go into the town and return after you lock the main gates, might that be possible?’</p>
<p class="indented">The porter’s face creased into a broad, gummy smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘All things are possible, Doctor Bruno,’ he said, with a wink. ‘Perhaps you have heard I sometimes come to certain agreements with the undergraduates regarding the locking of the gates. But you should not need any such arrangements – Fellows and guests may have a key to the main gate.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Really?’ I asked, surprised. ‘So the Fellows may leave the college by the main gate and enter at whatever hour they please?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is not exactly encouraged,’ Cobbett said, warily, ‘but yes, they may. Not many of ’em do, mind – they are all too serious-minded for gadding about the town. It’s the students who want to get out and are denied the liberty. But I was a young man once, and I say it does more harm than good to deny young men their pleasures. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, sir.’</p>
<p class="indented">I bent slightly and peered through the little window that opened on to the tower archway. Two students in black gowns passed, leather satchels clutched to their chests.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Can you see from here everyone who comes in and out at night, then?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="indented">‘As long as I’m awake,’ said Cobbett, with a husky laugh that quickly turned into another round of coughing.</p>
<p class="indented">There was more I wanted to ask, but I sensed my questions were making him suspicious, so I turned to the door.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you for your help, Cobbett – I must be getting along.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Doctor Bruno,’ he called, as I opened the door. I turned back. ‘Please do not repeat what I said about the Grove, will you? As much as it pains me, I must do as the rector instructs and say the blame was mine.’</p>
<p class="indented">I assured him that I would not mention our conversation. His face slumped with relief.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will gladly tell you more of locks and keys another time if you care to know,’ he added, casually twirling Mercer’s keys in his stubby fingers. Then he reached beneath the table and pulled out an earthenware flagon, waving it meaningfully in my direction. ‘But it is thirsty work, all this jawing. Conversation flows all the better for a bit of refreshment, if you catch my meaning.’</p>
<p class="indented">I smiled.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will see what refreshment I can find for you when we next converse, Cobbett,’ I said. ‘I shall look forward to it.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And I, Doctor Bruno, and I. Leave the door open, if you’d be so kind.’</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">He reached down and ruffled the dog’s fur between its ears; I could hear him chuckling to himself as I left the lodge and stood in front of the high main gate, wondering.</p>
<p class="flush-left">I returned to my chamber, glad to rid myself of the shirt now stiff with Roger Mercer’s blood, and to take the book out of my breeches, where its corners were digging uncomfortably into my stomach. Clad only in my underhose, oblivious to the chill of the room, I took a tinderbox from the mantelpiece and lit one of the cheap tallow candles with which the room had been provided; the chamber quickly filled with its acrid smoke as I took Mercer’s almanac and opened it, this time at the back. There were several blank pages bound into the covers, and one of these was oddly stiff, the paper slightly warped as if it had got wet and then dried out. I sniffed it closely; here the smell of oranges was most insistent. Carefully, so as not to scorch it, I held the page up close to the candle’s flame and watched as, slowly, a series of marks in dark brown began to grow visible. Moving the paper up and down past the flame, it gradually revealed its secret writing: a sequence of letters and symbols, with no logical pattern I could discern. Below this was a shorter series of the same symbols, though in a different order: grouped in two lots of three different symbols, then a group of five. It was evidently some kind of cipher, though I knew little of cryptography and had no idea how to begin decoding it. I wondered if Sidney might have a better idea, given that he had had more contact than I with such work, so I took a piece of paper and a quill and made a copy of the symbols exactly as they appeared on the page, thinking I would give this to him to work on. But as I copied the first three lines, it became clear that the symbols were arranged in a sequence of twenty-four, and that this sequence was repeated three times.</p>
<p class="indented">I paused. There were twenty-four letters in the English alphabet, but surely no cipher could be that obvious? None the less, I thought it worth a try, and on my copy I wrote out the alphabet underneath the first sequence of twenty-four symbols. If this was a basic substitution cipher, then according to this system the groups of letters underneath might mean something. I copied out the first group of three symbols according to the alphabetical substitution, and as I saw the result, O-R-A, I felt my pulse quicken. Hurriedly I translated the remaining letters of the short phrase, and drew my breath in sharply. I had written the words <em class="calibre2">Ora pro nobis</em>. Pray for us.</p>
<p class="indented">Folding the copy carefully and hiding it under my pillow, I laid my head down gratefully, trying to imagine why Roger Mercer had written those words – the refrain from the Catholic Litany of the Saints – invisibly in the back of his almanac. But I had to put the puzzle from my mind; there were more pressing matters for my attention. I had intended only to close my eyes for a few moments before gathering my thoughts and setting them to concentrate on the evening’s disputation, which was supposed to be the crowning glory of my first visit to Oxford, but I was awakened all of a sudden by a furious hammering on the door and sat upright, confused and bleary.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Open up, for Christ’s sake!’ a man’s voice bellowed, and for a moment my bowels clenched: had there been another violent death? The door handle rattled urgently as I struggled out of my sheets and into a clean shirt, and when finally I wrenched it open, there stood Sidney, quiffed and impatient, dressed head to foot in green velvet, with a neck ruff that made his head look as if it were perched on a platter.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Christ alive, Bruno, I came as soon as I heard!’ He strode past me into the room, stripping off his gloves with a businesslike air. ‘I had barely breakfasted this morning when what should I hear from the servants but that all of Christ Church cloister is aflame with the news that a savage beast stalks Lincoln College, dragging innocent men to their doom.’ He looked me up and down, eyes wide in mock terror. ‘Well – at least you still have all your limbs, God be praised.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Philip – a man died in front of me this morning,’ I said wearily.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I know – I want to hear all about it,’ he said. ‘Come on, dress yourself, man – I have come to take you out to dinner.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What time is it?’ I said, suddenly panicked; clearly I had slept much longer than I intended, and my stomach was crying out with hunger, but I had not yet even begun my preparation for the disputation at five.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Just past one.’ Sidney sauntered around the room, picking up books and considering them idly while I rummaged for clean hose and a plain doublet. ‘One lad at Christ Church said a wolf had got into the college – I thought that seemed unlikely. Did you see what happened?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘By tomorrow they’ll be saying it was a lion,’ I said. ‘These students seem starved of incident here, they will make legends out of any matter. But I will be glad to tell you all, for there is much that troubles me, and I have something to show you. Let us find some food first, though.’ I took the almanac from under my pillow and tucked it inside my doublet before fastening the buttons, Sidney watching me curiously as I did so.</p>
<p class="indented">The air was still damp though the sky was lighter as we passed under the tower gate into St Mildred’s Lane, then south past the tall spire of All Hallows Church. At the High Street we paused to let two riders on horseback pass, then crossed between piles of dung and straw that littered the muddy thoroughfare, churned up after all the rain. I was glad I had put on my riding boots. Young men in short black gowns hurried past us in groups, all chattering over one another. At the corner of a narrow lane edged by low timber-framed houses, Sidney turned and led me towards a two-storey building with gabled roofs which bore a painted sign creaking above its door: Peckwater Inn.</p>
<p class="indented">The cobbled yard was busy as we passed under the gate; men led horses across towards a stable block at the back as others unloaded heavy-looking barrels from a high cart. The building occupied three sides of a quadrangle, with two levels of balconies on each side overlooking the yard.</p>
<p class="indented">Inside, the tap-room was dim and a fire burned in a stone hearth at one end. Long, rough-hewn tables and benches were set around the edges of the room, many of them occupied already by busy diners talking and eating at once; a serving hatch was built into the wall opposite the fireplace, and a red-faced woman in an apron scuttled between it and the tables ferrying wooden platters and pewter tankards, pausing occasionally to brush a strand of damp hair from her face with the back of her hand. When she noticed us, her harried expression changed to one of delight and she rushed over, wiping her hands on her apron.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Sir Philip! What a pleasure – we heard you were back in town,’ she said with a wink. ‘They said there was a great procession in your honour.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It was a very wet procession, and the honour was not mine, Lizzy,’ Sidney said, removing his hat and making a solemn bow. ‘May I present my dear friend from Italy, Doctor Giordano Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Buongiorno, signorina</em>,’ I said, playing up to Sidney’s exaggerated courtliness.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Pleasure, I’m sure,’ the tavern-mistress giggled, her considerable bosom quivering.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Now then, Lizzy – we’d like a quiet table, a jug of beer when you have a moment, your best game pie and some fresh bread, if you please.’</p>
<p class="indented">She beamed up at him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You best take the corner table, you won’t be disturbed there,’ she said, and bustled off towards the kitchen.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I used to come here all the time,’ Sidney explained. ‘The inn is hard by Christ Church and there was more varied company to be had here than inside the college when I was a student, if you know what I mean. We will be well treated in any case, they know I tip generously. Now then, Bruno – tell your tale.’</p>
<p class="indented">He sat back and folded his hands together with the air of one who expects to be entertained. I could not help feeling he was taking a man’s death rather lightly, treating it as material for an exciting anecdote; in that he reminded me of Gabriel Norris. Perhaps it is a trait of rich boys, I thought: craving adventure in a life made dull by the absence of daily cares. I was about to launch into my account when Lizzy arrived with a jug of beer, two tankards and a loaf of bread that Sidney ripped into immediately, handing me the first piece.</p>
<p class="indented">With my mouth half-full, I told him of all that had happened since I was first awakened by the dog’s fearsome noise at dawn. When I came to the part about the locked gates, his complacent expression vanished and he leaned forward eagerly, his eyes alert.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You suspect foul play?’ he asked, as the tavern-mistress arrived again with a platter of thick game pie.</p>
<p class="indented">When she had gone, I told him of my visit to Roger Mercer’s room, the interruption by Slythurst and my subsequent conversation with the old porter. When I had finished, Sidney whistled through his teeth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Extraordinary business,’ he said, shaking his head in disbelief. ‘So you surmise someone set that dog on him on purpose, then ransacked his room looking for something valuable?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That is the mystery,’ I said. ‘It can’t be valuable in the usual sense, because whoever did it had no interest in the ten pounds he was carrying, or the chest of gold in his room. But that is what I can’t fathom – someone lured him to the garden on the pretext of a meeting, clearly someone to whom he owed money. So why didn’t they take the money and then kill him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not necessarily a debt,’ Sidney said, his mouth full. ‘Might it not have been someone who had something to sell?’</p>
<p class="indented">I frowned.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But what would he be buying at that hour, in the Grove? Something contraband, you think?’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney was regarding me with amusement, a knowing smile playing about his lips.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Think, Bruno – what might a man want to buy under cover of darkness?’</p>
<p class="indented">I looked back at him blankly, then caught his meaning.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Whores, you mean? But in that case, how much simpler – and warmer – just to find a whorehouse in town.’ I shook my head. ‘Even if he <em class="calibre2">was</em> whoring – someone else knew to find him there at that time, someone who had a key to the Grove. And it still doesn’t explain who went through his room, or why. Whatever they were looking for must have been of value to the person who wanted it – the place was torn to shreds, as if they sought it with utmost urgency.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you say at least two people wanted whatever it might have been – the bursar and the other fellow who got there before you.’ Sidney’s brow creased for a moment and he took a long draught of beer. ‘One thing is strange, though. It’s such a cowardly way to kill a man, and so imprecise, too. If you want a man dead, why not just run him through with a sword? Especially if you know where to find him alone and unarmed. A dog is so unpredictable.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You know about hunting,’ I said, cutting myself another brick of the pie. ‘Could a hound like that be trained to attack a particular person, follow a scent?’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney considered.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I suppose – if it can be trained to follow the scent of a boar or a wolf, why not a man? If it was given one of his garments, perhaps. The Irish used to use them in battle – apparently they could pull an armoured knight off his horse. And you say it had been kept hungry, so its instincts would be all the keener.’ He leaned his elbows on the table and rested his chin on cupped hands. ‘It’s as if the dog were part of some kind of show, as if it were done to create a spectacle. And what a way to die – locked in with a bloodthirsty animal. Makes me think,’ he said, putting another hunk of bread into his mouth, ‘of how the Romans used to execute the early saints, by throwing them into an arena with wild beasts. The way John Foxe describes it in that grisly <em class="calibre2">Book of Martyrs</em>.’</p>
<p class="indented">I stopped, a piece of meat halfway to my mouth, and stared at him, slack-jawed.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What?’ Sidney stopped chewing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Foxe’s <em class="calibre2">Book of Martyrs</em>. The rector of Lincoln has a great interest in him – he has been preaching sermons in chapel with Foxe as his text.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney frowned.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You think someone wanted to get rid of this Mercer and took inspiration from Foxe for his method?’</p>
<p class="indented">His expression betrayed his scepticism.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It does seem far-fetched. Perhaps I am reading too much into it.’ I passed my hands over my face. ‘You are right – it was probably just a bad debt or trouble over a whore. No wonder the rector wants it covered up while a royal visitation is in town.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney was silent for a moment. Then he banged a palm down on the table.</p>
<p class="indented">‘No, Bruno – I think you are right to be suspicious. The dog was loosed into the garden by someone who had a key, which suggests one of the Fellows or someone with access to the college keys. And at least two people wanted something from his room, but not money. Perhaps something that might be dangerous to them. And if everyone in the college has recently heard stories of the saints’ gruesome deaths from Foxe’s book, thanks to the rector – perhaps in some way it was staged as a deliberate copy. The question is, why? Did you find nothing in his room?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Only this. Take a look,’ I said, extracting the slim almanac. ‘What do you notice first?’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney turned a couple of pages, then looked up at me, his face serious.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Gregorian calendar. Was our man a secret papist after all, like his friend Allen?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I wondered. I heard him cry out to Mary before he died.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’d cry to Mary if a dog that size was snapping at my arse,’ said Sidney bluntly, turning the book over in his hands. ‘That signifies nothing. But this calendar – you would only need this if you were corresponding with anyone in the Catholic countries. Especially if you needed to co-ordinate movements. Edmund Allen went to Rheims, did he not? Wasn’t he related to William Allen, who founded the English College there?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A cousin, they said. Mercer could still have been in touch with him, you mean?’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney glanced to either side and lowered his voice.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Remember why we are here, Bruno. These seminaries in Rheims and Rome are Walsingham’s greatest headache at the moment – they have vast funds from the Vatican and are in the business of training dozens of priests for the English mission, many of them former Oxford men.’ He pulled his beard into a point as he thought, then picked up the book again. ‘What is this little circle here?’ he asked, pointing to the wheel symbol that marked the previous day’s entry in Mercer’s calendar.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t know. It appears often. I wondered if it might be a code.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney peered closer, then shook his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I recognise it, but I can’t think from where. Looks like one of your magical symbols, Bruno.’</p>
<p class="indented">I had not liked to say so, but the thought had crossed my mind; Mercer had secretly confided an interest in magic. Even so, the symbol was not one I recognised, and so it intrigued me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘It’s not an astrological symbol, that is certain,’ I said. ‘But that is not the most important thing. Smell the book.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney frowned indulgently, but brought the book close to his face.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oranges?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes. Look to the back.’</p>
<p class="indented">He flicked through the pages, then looked up at me, nodding with something like admiration.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Good work, Bruno. That is an old trick, the invisible writing in orange juice. Have you found some secret message?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A cipher. I made a copy – here.’ I pushed my piece of paper across the table at him. ‘You see what he has written at the bottom?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre2">Ora pro nobis</em>. Well, well.’ Sidney folded the paper carefully and handed it back to me. ‘Could be some sort of password or secret sign.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That’s what I thought. Should we inform Walsingham?’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney thought for a moment, then shook his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We have nothing to tell him yet, except that we suspect a man of Catholic affiliations who is already dead. He would not thank us for wasting his time, and I cannot spare the expense of a messenger to London until we have something better. No – I think you should pursue this as discreetly as you may,’ he continued, closing the book and handing it back. ‘Especially if you say Rector Underhill seems keen to have it hushed up – he may know more than he lets on. Just because he was appointed by my uncle it does not follow that he can be trusted – the earl has made mistakes in his judgement before now.’ He set his lips in a tight line. ‘And who is this J – have you any thoughts?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I have met three men whose names begin with J,’ I said. ‘John Florio, James Coverdale and John Underhill, the rector. But it may not signify a name. Perhaps it is another coded symbol.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney nodded grimly.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps. There is much to think about. But for now, my dear Bruno,’ he said, suddenly smiling, ‘you must think only about this evening’s disputation. You must dazzle all Oxford with the new cosmology, and put this business from your mind. Lizzy – let me settle this account!’ he called, as the serving-woman glanced in our direction. ‘And I will take a large bottle of your strongest ale for the road,’ he added genially, counting coins from his purse. When she had gone to fetch one, he leaned in and winked. ‘A little gift for you to take your new friend the porter. I’ll tell you this about Oxford – the porters guard more secrets than anyone in the university. Befriend your porter and he will quite literally open doors for you. And now, Bruno,’ he said, clapping me on the back, ‘you must go and settle this small matter of whether or not the Earth moves around the Sun.’</p>
<p class="indented">I was about to rise and take my leave when a great gale of laughter and chatter erupted from behind us as the tap-room door opened to admit a group of four tall young men dressed expensively in jerkins of buff leather, silk peasecod doublets and short slashed breeches to show off their legs in fine silk stockings, all sporting bright starched ruffs above their collars and short velvet cloaks over one shoulder. They carried themselves with an identical swagger, talking loudly in cultured voices, making crude jokes to the serving-girl, and when they turned around I realised that the tallest of them was Gabriel Norris. He recognised me and raised a hand in greeting.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ah, <em class="calibre2">il gentil doctore</em>!’ he cried, beckoning his friends over to our table. ‘Come, boys, meet my new friend, the renowned Italian philosopher Doctor Giordano Bruno, and –’ he stopped suddenly as he looked at Sidney for the first time and smartly executed a low bow, then turned to me expectantly and I realised I was supposed to effect the introductions.</p>
<p class="indented">‘This is Master Gabriel Norris,’ I announced, as Norris bowed again, ‘who so expertly despatched the mad dog in the garden this morning. This is my friend Sir Philip Sidney.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are the brave huntsman, then?’ Sidney said, arching an eyebrow in amusement.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I cannot claim too much praise for that feat, sir – the dog was barely yards from me. I prefer more of a challenge when I draw my bow,’ Norris replied, with a self-deprecating laugh. ‘There is good hunting to be had at Shotover Forest, though, Sir Philip, if you are looking for some sport during your stay.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’d welcome the chance, if this weather clears,’ Sidney said. ‘Norris, you say? Who is your father?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘George Norris, gentleman, of Buckinghamshire,’ Norris said, effecting another bow. ‘But he lived most of his later life in France and Flanders.’</p>
<p class="indented">Sidney appeared to be consulting some kind of mental register to see if the name meant something. Eventually he shook his head politely.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Don’t know him. France, eh? Exile, was he?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Oh, no, Sir Philip.’ Norris laughed again. ‘He was a merchant. Cloth and luxury goods. He was exceptionally good at his business.’ He gave Sidney a broad wink and rubbed his fingers together in the international sign for money. His manner was beginning to grate on me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Will you stay and drink with us?’ he continued eagerly, already reaching into his purse for coins. ‘Hie, girl – over here!’ he called, gesturing imperiously at Lizzy. ‘My friends plan to try and wrest some of that money from me over a few hands of bone-ace, but I am unbeaten yet this term. Are you a gambling man, Sir Philip? How about you, Doctor Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">I held up my hands in apology, but I saw the light of adventure spark in Sidney’s eyes, and he rubbed his hands together, shunting over on the bench to make room for Norris.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Philosophers are notoriously bad at cards,’ Sidney said, waving a hand at me to move over and make room for Norris’s friends beside me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘All the more reason for Doctor Bruno to stay and join our game,’ Norris said, smiling widely at me. He reached into his doublet and drew out a pack of cards, which he proceeded to shuffle expertly with the ease of long practice. I realised with a prickle of discomfort why he bothered me: it was not so much that I resented the hearty backslapping bonhomie of English upper-class gentlemen, for I could tolerate it well enough in Sidney on his own. It was the way Sidney fell so easily into this strutting group of young men, where I could not, and the fear that he might in some ways prefer their company to mine. Once again, I felt that peculiar stab of loneliness that only an exile truly knows: the sense that I did not belong, and never would again.</p>
<p class="indented">Norris snapped the pack against the flat of his hand and began swiftly to deal three cards to each player, two face down and one face up.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Shall we put in a shilling each to begin? If you hope to hold on to any of your money, Tobie,’ he remarked to the dark-haired young man seated opposite, ‘you had better start praying to St Bernardino of Siena, the patron saint of gamblers, for I am feeling lucky today.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Praying to saints, Gabe?’ said the young man named Tobie with a sly grin, picking up his cards and considering them. ‘Do not let anyone overhear you encouraging that, or they will think you gone over to Rome.’</p>
<p class="indented">Norris snorted.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I speak in jest, you dull-wit. Gentlemen should never debate theology at the card table. But am I not right, Doctor Bruno – your countryman is said to intercede for gamblers? By those who believe in that kind of folly,’ he added, throwing a handful of coins into the middle of the table.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Actually, in Italy, he is more renowned for his tirades against sodomites,’ I replied, getting up from the table. Norris looked up sharply from his hand and regarded me with interest.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Is that so?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He lamented that in the last century the Italians were famed throughout Europe as the greatest nation of sodomites.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And are you?’ he asked, a smile twitching at the edge of his mouth.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We are the greatest nation at everything, my friend,’ I said, returning the half-smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Bruno spent most of his life inside a monastery,’ Sidney said, leaning over to dig Norris in the ribs. ‘He should know.’</p>
<p class="indented">The group fell into raucous laughter then as Lizzy slapped two large pitchers of ale down on the table. I decided it was time to leave.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well, I will leave you to rob one another with the blessing of St Bernardino,’ I said, attempting to sound light-hearted. ‘I have more pressing business.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Bruno must reorder the cosmos before five o’clock,’ Sidney said, though he was intent on the cards he held.</p>
<p class="indented">‘We are all most eager to hear it,’ Norris said, his head still bent to his hand, then he flung down an ace of diamonds with a great cry of triumph and swept all the coins from the table as the others exploded in a riot of cursing. None of them looked up as I left.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-number"><a href="part0003.html#chapter004" class="calibre4">FOUR</a></h2>
<p class="flush-left-opener">I woke late the next morning, opening my eyes to a dusty grey light with a lingering sense of dread. Easing myself on to my elbows, I registered the bruises along my shoulder and hip from my plunge the day before, but it took a moment longer for my mind to struggle through the fog of sleep until I could be sure that I had not dreamed my nocturnal audience with the King and its unwelcome conclusion.</p>
<p class="indented">So she had fled to Paris, as I had suspected. Sophia Underhill, the woman I had known in Oxford and Canterbury. The King was right; she had bested me, and the memory of it still burned. Like a fool, I had thought myself proof against the wiles of women; the self-discipline I had learned in thirteen years as a Dominican served me well enough to withstand the cynical and obvious seductresses of the French court, but nothing had prepared me for a woman like Sophia. Educated, spirited, hungry for life, knowledge, independence, she had found herself ceaselessly frustrated by the constraints placed on her by her sex. Life had not been kind to her, and those scars had lent her a lean and wary look, and an edge of ruthlessness in her determination not to be duped. She made it a matter of principle to strike first, before you could touch her; she trusted no one. That was a bitter lesson, and one I had learned too late. I had done my best to excise her from my heart and my memory, but the agitation I now felt at the possibility that she might still be in Paris suggested I had not succeeded. I tore a comb through my hair and examined my face in the glass to judge how much I had aged since she last saw me, all the while cursing her under my breath. Now I would walk every street searching the crowds for her face, despite myself.</p>
<p class="indented">Outside, the rain had relented but a thick mist lay over the streets, rising in curlicues from the river; it would not burn off now, with the air so cold and dank. Resting one hand on my dagger beneath my cloak and darting frequent glances over my shoulder, I followed the rue Saint-Jacques north towards the river, picking my way through hoof-churned mud and waterlogged wheel-ruts as the damp seeped through the soles of my boots. A bell tolled sullenly nearby; students hurried between the faculties of the Sorbonne, urgent voices carrying out of the mist before they emerged like rooks, robes snapping around dirt-spattered ankles, deep in earnest debate. I kept my head down, but my senses alert. No one appeared to pay me any attention, for which I was grateful.</p>
<p class="indented">The church of Saint-Séverin squatted on the corner of Saint-Jacques and rue des Prêtres, one street away from the river, a sprawling mongrel of styles and stones jumbled together over four centuries. Gargoyles leered down from its buttresses. I was surprised to find a crowd of at least a hundred gathered in the churchyard, clustered around a tombstone on which a man with grey stubble and fiery eyes stood shouting with his legs planted wide and a fist raised. I wondered first if he was mad, but as I drew closer I could hear his voice ringing out clear and purposeful, as if he were accustomed to oratory; some among his audience were clutching sticks and pokers and bellowing their agreement. The mood felt as edgy and dangerous as it had the previous Sunday, after Paul’s sermon.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The House of Valois believe they can defy all the laws of God and man without consequence,’ he cried, to an appreciative roar. ‘For years they have been stained with incest and murder, sorcery and heresy.’ (More roaring.) ‘Now our king allows heretics to flourish in France and we all know what is coming, don’t we, my brothers and sisters?’ (A frantic chorus of agreement.) ‘When the Huguenot Navarre is king, the Protestants will take their revenge for Saint Bartholomew’s night. They will rise up and cut us down in our homes. The streets of Paris will run red with Catholic blood, yours and mine, brothers and sisters!’ (A scream of ‘God have mercy’ from a woman in the throng.) ‘God has turned his face from France. Our harvests have failed, our armies are defeated, children and widows starve in the gutters. And what right have we to expect otherwise, when we allow ourselves to be governed by a king who is a blasphemer, a sodomite and a murderer, and his witch mother?’</p>
<p class="indented">The crowd almost lost control, roaring and brandishing their weapons; I stepped back in alarm as a man near me swiped a butcher’s cleaver through the air. I began to wish I had stayed away; there would be blood spilled before this was over.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Our dear curé, Père Lefèvre, has been murdered in cold blood for daring to speak out against the decay and corruption of the royal line. Thus the Valois show their contempt for the Church, for the laws of God and for human life. There will be no justice for him unless we the people demand it. We must march on the Louvre! Justice for Père Lefèvre!’</p>
<p class="indented">The crowd erupted in a cacophony of righteous fury; ‘Death to the King!’ and ‘Justice for Père Lefèvre!’ rang in the damp air. I took the opportunity to scurry away to the church. The main door was locked, but I followed a path around the back and found a side door that had been forgotten. It was a relief to step into the cool gloom of the empty nave. Despite the mist outside, a pearly light filtered through the high windows, painting faint jewel colours over the delicate arches of the vaults and the worn faces carved on the capitals. Here the air was cold and clear; the mineral smell of old stone cut through lingering traces of beeswax and stale incense. It seemed a lifetime ago that I had listened to the echo of my footsteps on these same stones on my way to corner Paul in his confessional. The dust swirling in ribs of light might have hung in the air for centuries. I stood before the altar, casting around as if I had lost something, until I attracted the attention of a young curate crossing one of the side aisles, a red-haired man in his mid-twenties with a preoccupied air and a tic in his left eye that gave the impression he was frantically winking at me.</p>
<p class="indented">‘The church is closed, monsieur. How did you get in?’ He sounded frightened.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’m not one of them,’ I said, jerking my thumb towards the door. ‘I was a friend of Père Lefèvre.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘May God have mercy on his soul,’ he muttered, crossing himself. ‘A very sad business. But I can’t help you. The doors are supposed to be barred until they disperse.’ He chewed his lip and pulled at a thread on the cuff of his cassock.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I only wondered if anyone knew what had happened. I heard him preach on Sunday. It’s been a terrible shock.’</p>
<p class="indented">The young curate bit his thumbnail. ‘I understand there was an accident.’ His gaze flicked past me to the pillars of the ambulatory and the recesses behind. ‘He was attacked outside the city walls, they said.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘That doesn’t sound like an accident.’</p>
<p class="indented">Another sideways glance. ‘I don’t know any more than that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He seemed anxious recently. Something was troubling him.’ I left this hanging, neither quite a question nor a statement. This young man, for all his twitching, appeared shrewd; if he worked with Paul every day, he would surely have noticed any unusual behaviour.</p>
<p class="indented">Recognition sparked in his eyes for a moment, before it was replaced by the shadow of suspicion.</p>
<p class="indented">‘<em class="calibre6">Who</em> did you say you were?’</p>
<p class="indented">I searched his eyes again. A man in a priest’s robes, the laundress had said. Not this one; the voice was wrong. But there would be other curates here, potentially his friends or confederates.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’ve known Paul – Père Lefèvre – for a long time. Before he was ordained. We were at the Sorbonne together.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Before he joined the League, then.’ His tone gave nothing away. I had the sense that he was testing me. I decided to take a further risk.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Yes. Back when he was still human.’</p>
<p class="indented">The young curate’s face visibly relaxed. ‘I did not have that pleasure. I have only been here six months.’ He fixed me with a look that seemed intended to convey what he felt he could not voice. ‘I don’t think I have seen you here before?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I did not attend often. I found Paul’s sermons increasingly hard to swallow.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You were not alone there.’</p>
<p class="indented">Little by little, I thought, I could coax some truth out of him. ‘He was a difficult man to get along with,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">He shrugged. ‘He was sincere in his beliefs, at least.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Not in itself a virtue. The Pharisees were sincere. Luther and Calvin were nothing if not sincere.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘True.’ He liked this; a faint smile chased across his lips. He glanced past me again, down the aisle towards the door, and dropped his voice another notch. ‘I say nothing against the League, you understand. They may be right on some points. Many points, even. But I believe a priest’s role is to preach the word of God, and to bring harmony where there is discord, not to fuel more discord. Our duty is the cure of souls, and there is a high price to pay for disregarding that.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you think Paul paid that price?’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">The twitch in his eye intensified and his face closed up. ‘You have heard the crowd out there. They have already delivered their verdict. I’m afraid I must ask you to leave now, monsieur, so that I can lock the doors.’ He paused as another animal roar rose up from the churchyard. ‘When they are inflamed, they tend to break things.’</p>
<p class="indented">He turned and began to walk away through the ambulatory. I hurried after him as he slipped between the rows of carved columns, and caught at his sleeve.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But you <em class="calibre6">had</em> noticed that he seemed troubled lately, Father?’</p>
<p class="indented">He walked on a few more paces then stopped and turned to face me, anxiety knotting his features. ‘I don’t know who you are, but for the sake of Saint-Séverin, leave this alone. Let us mourn him quietly. His death is tragedy enough without it becoming more ammunition for one side or the other.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘It is already too late to escape that, I fear.’ I gestured in the direction of the noise outside. ‘Please – if you know anything about his death, it may help to prevent more violence.’</p>
<p class="indented">He regarded me a moment longer, then drew me by the elbow into an unlit side chapel, out of sight.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are right that he was not himself lately,’ he said, in a voice that barely reached a whisper. ‘It began no more than a month ago. He seemed all of a sudden – uncertain.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘About what?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Everything.’ He circled a hand to encompass the chapel, the altar, the crucifix above it. ‘He grew more and more withdrawn – I might almost say fearful. He was often absent – he turned up to celebrate Mass, but between times none of us knew where he was. Once he stopped me and demanded out of nowhere to know why I had desired to be ordained, and if I still felt the same.’ He shook his head. ‘I had witnessed something similar with a fellow ordinand when I was in the seminary. If it had been anyone else, I would have said …’ He let the sentence tail off.</p>
<p class="indented">‘That he was losing his faith,’ I offered. I had seen it too, when I was taking holy orders; no one who has entered the religious life could fail to recognise a crisis of belief in a brother. ‘But it did not show in his sermons.’</p>
<p class="indented">The young curate’s eyes narrowed. ‘I thought you said you did not attend service here?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I came on Sunday. He invited me in person.’</p>
<p class="indented">He weighed this up and nodded. ‘You are right. It was quite the opposite, in fact – the more he seemed to be unravelling in private, the more of a demagogue he became in the pulpit. As if he could drown out his doubts by shouting his convictions in public.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And you have no idea what prompted this – unravelling? Was there a confrontation, perhaps?’</p>
<p class="indented">A guilty flicker across his face; the eye tic quickened. I waited.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Four weeks ago,’ he said, so quietly the words barely escaped his lips, ‘the first day of November, we had celebrated the Mass of All Souls. I stayed late after the service to clear up and lock away the silverware. I thought everyone had left, but when I came back to the ambulatory, I heard raised voices from inside this chapel. Père Lefèvre was arguing with someone.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you hear what they said?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Père Lefèvre called him Judas. The other man laughed, and said Lefèvre should be more careful with his words. I wanted to get home but I didn’t want them to think I’d been listening, so I made an obvious noise outside and they fell silent immediately. They must have thought they were alone. The other fellow slipped away down one of the side aisles and Lefèvre walked out and tried to greet me as if nothing had happened. But I could tell he was upset.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Did you see the man he was arguing with?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I did not catch sight of his face, but I saw what he wore.’ He hesitated, biting his lip again. ‘The black habit of the Augustinians.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A friar from Saint-Victor, then?’</p>
<p class="indented">He seemed about to reply when I thought I caught a slight movement outside the chapel; I whipped around, but when I poked my head out, there was no one in sight in either direction. The curate had heard it too; his eyes darted around the walls like a cornered animal.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You must leave now. I have to lock the church.’</p>
<p class="indented">He chivvied me out into the damp air. When I turned the corner by the apse, I saw that the crowd had grown; people stood on tombs and jostled for position along the wall as the man with the stubble, his voice now hoarse, whipped them on to cries of bloody vengeance against the King. The mood had darkened; they brandished makeshift weapons and turned black stares on those who did not join in with the chorus of slogans.</p>
<p class="indented-space-after">‘Death to the House of Valois,’ I muttered, to placate a murderous-looking blacksmith who was eyeing me while pounding a hammer into his fist. The mob had knotted tightly around the churchyard gate; it would be impossible to fight my way through without injury. I knew how these protests ended, too; shop windows smashed, carts and houses set on fire, people bloodied and wounded in the confusion; then royal troops called out to quell the crowd, shots fired, more injuries or even deaths, which would stoke the anger further. I only wanted to get away as quickly as possible. I decided I would have to climb over the wall, though it was hard to see a place where it was not jammed with eager spectators. I glanced to my left and noticed a tall man of about my own age standing on the fringe of the crowd, his arms folded, watching the growing frenzy with an air of detachment. His clothes were expensively tailored, his neat pointed beard and chestnut hair carefully barbered, making him conspicuous in this rabble of rough-clad tradesmen and apprentices. I wondered if he was an informer. He glanced across and caught my eye with a frankness that implied recognition. I half-expected him to address me, but his look seemed neither friendly nor hostile; he merely observed me, making no attempt to hide it, before returning his attention to the man still delivering his impassioned speech from the plinth. Unease needled up the back of my neck. A quick check through my memory assured me that I did not know his face, though he had seemed to know me. I turned and walked briskly the way I had come, away from the mob, conscious of the stranger’s eyes following me until I was out of sight.</p>
<p class="flush-left-opener">It was a relief to escape the churchyard; the mood of the crowd promised violence before too long. I realised I had not eaten since the night before and my stomach was pinched with hunger. On the corner of rue Saint-Jacques I bought a galette in a greasy paper from a street vendor and demolished it in two bites. The noise from Saint-Séverin carried through the chilly air; the vendor shook his head and began to pack up his wares, anticipating a riot. Over my left shoulder, the façade of Notre Dame gazed downriver towards the Louvre, serene and implacable on its island.</p>
<p class="indented">The rabble and its leader clearly held the King responsible for Paul’s death, or were content to use it as an excuse, though I concluded that I had no choice but to proceed as if Henri were telling the truth: that he had nothing to do with the murder and that the Duke of Guise, having encouraged Paul to attack the King in his sermon, had then had him murdered with the sole purpose of inflaming further outrage against the House of Valois. If that were the case, it meant I was looking for evidence that would link the murderer to Guise, who already had more than enough reason to want me dead, if he too suspected that I had been instrumental in disrupting his plans to invade England. Guise had no firm proof that I had intercepted those letters in London, but that hardly mattered; since I was the only known enemy of the Catholic Church living in the French embassy at the time the conspiracy was uncovered, it hardly took advanced powers of reasoning to point the finger in my direction. As I had already observed, Guise was no fool. If the Duke found out I was trying to expose him a second time, he would have my balls roasted on a skewer, while the King looked the other way and studied his manicure. In that light, it became clearer why Henri had asked me to undertake this business and not one of his usual fixers: he considered me expendable.</p>
<p class="indented">I passed under the Porte de la Tournelle and paused in the shelter of the tower wall to wipe my forehead where the mist had condensed in cold droplets on my hair and brows. Behind me, under the shadow of the arch, I thought I glimpsed someone else stopping too. I twisted around, but saw only the usual stream of hawkers and goodwives, mules and handcarts, ragged children and dogs, all spattered with mud and weighed down with bales of cloth, coils of rope, barrows of vegetables or baskets of eggs, making their way in and out of the city to barter or beg. No one obviously loitering or watching me; and yet, after nine years of living in exile, one eye always open for anyone who might want to arrest me or knife me in a back alley, I had developed a finely tuned instinct for being followed, and now it quivered like a cat’s whiskers. I pulled up the hood of my cloak and moved on along the road away from the Porte, straining to catch any unexpected movement through the grey air.</p>
<p class="indented">The abbey church of Saint-Victor reared up in the distance behind its boundary wall and orchards, its spire a bony finger poking through a shroud of low-lying mist swirling up from the river. A lone crow called into the empty sky, as if announcing my arrival. I shivered, wondering if the night’s rain had washed Paul’s blood away from the track along the bank behind the abbey, by that small door in the back wall. Now there was a man in a friar’s habit to add to the picture, and I wished the curate’s testimony had not pointed me here again.</p>
<p class="indented">Saint-Victor – or at least its opulent library – had become a kind of sanctuary for me since my return to Paris. Four years ago, before I left for England, the old abbot had been pleased to grant me free access to the library, despite the misgivings of some of his brothers over my writings, but that was when I had the distinction of being a Reader at the Sorbonne and personal tutor of philosophy to the King, before the rumours of magic trailed after me. The new Abbé was deeply conservative in matters of religion and learning, a public supporter of Guise and the Catholic League; though Frère Guillaume Cotin, the librarian, had welcomed me back as a friend, we had kept the arrangement between ourselves. But I had come to depend on the library, and not merely because it would be impossible for me to finish my next book without access to its manuscripts. In all the turbulence of the last few months, I had come to find in its stillness and its smell of old books, polished wood and candles, a comforting sense of order. I did not want to lose my one refuge in Paris, nor did I wish to cause any trouble to Cotin, after his generosity to me. If Paul’s killer came from the abbey, he would have powerful men protecting him, and they would not welcome the intrusive questions of an ex-Dominican known to be a friend of the King.</p>
<p class="indented">An ominous silence hung over the scriptorium with its rows of chained manuscripts; at the hour of None, most of the friars would be in church. Two who must have had special permission to miss divine service were still working at desks under the west windows; they glanced up with mild curiosity as I entered. Cotin bustled across to intercept me. He had evidently been waiting.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Bruno! I thought you weren’t coming today. I feared—’ He glanced across the room at the two young copyists, who had turned to whisper to one another, and nodded me towards a spiral staircase in the corner. This led to an upper gallery, which in turn opened on to a series of connecting rooms, each with a locked door guarding the volumes considered either too valuable or too inflammatory for public display. Cotin unlocked the first of these doors from a key ring on his belt and pulled me inside, closing it behind him.</p>
<p class="indented">‘They’ve been looking for you,’ he said, breathless. He was well into his sixties by now; short and broad, with tufts of white bristle sprouting from his ears and nostrils and a bushy greying beard, as if all the hair had migrated south from his flaking scalp. Without his eyeglasses, his face appeared undefended, his pale blue eyes squinting and anxious, as if fearful of missing some vital detail. ‘There’s been a lot of talk, since yesterday, that business with the priest. What’s going on, Bruno?’</p>
<p class="indented">I shook my head. ‘Who’s looking for me?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Abbé wants to question you. They know the priest asked for you before he died, and spoke some words that you refused to share. The Abbé called me in to see him last night – gave me quite an interrogation. How long you had been coming here, which books you asked for, what you were writing. He was not happy that I had let you return without seeking his permission.’ He paused and grimaced, pulling the cloth of his habit away from his neck as if it was chafing.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I am sorry to have caused you trouble. I never anticipated—’</p>
<p class="indented">He tutted the apology away, glancing over his shoulder. ‘The Abbé is a pompous fool. I have learned to accommodate him. But there is a great commotion over this death, Bruno – apparently the priest was a close associate of the League, and the Duke of Guise regards his killing as a personal attack. The Abbé wants to know what secrets he whispered to you on his deathbed.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I see. Prompted by his love of justice, of course.’</p>
<p class="indented">Cotin gave me a long look from under his brows. ‘The Abbé has his eye on a cardinal’s hat. He thinks Guise is his surest route to one. And he has no choice but to concern himself with this murder, since the priest died inside the abbey walls.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘He was attacked only yards from your back gate, too,’ I said. ‘I’d be surprised if that was a coincidence.’</p>
<p class="indented">His face contorted with distress. ‘God have mercy on us all. There is something I must show you, Bruno. You are the only man I dare tell.’ He stopped abruptly, laying his hand on my sleeve, head cocked as if listening. I thought I caught a sound from the room behind us. ‘Follow me. The servant on the gate will have told them you’re here by now. We’ll go out this way.’</p>
<p class="indented">He unlocked the far door and led me through a further succession of rooms until we emerged from a tower in the west side of the courtyard beyond the cloisters. Cotin motioned to me to keep back inside the doorway until two friars had passed, carrying a basket between them. When he judged we were safe, he led me along a passageway between stone walls and out into the gardens behind the abbey’s complex of buildings. Here we were exposed, though the dense mist offered a useful cover; Cotin pulled up his hood and I followed his example as we hurried across the open space to the shelter of the orchard beyond.</p>
<p class="indented">Fruit trees loomed in twisted shapes, the fog lingering clammy between them, but Cotin ploughed on, ducking under branches and around trunks with a dogged sense of direction, despite the absence of any path that I could make out. I glanced back to see if we had been followed, but saw nothing through the web of mist except the knotty outlines of bare trees.</p>
<p class="indented">After a good ten minutes’ walking we reached the far side of the orchard and the solid mass of the boundary wall appeared, twelve feet high around the perimeter. Gulls circled above, harsh calls echoing over the river on the other side. I had not been to this part of the abbey grounds before; there had been no reason for me to venture so far from the main cloister and the library. I now saw that a row of low buildings lined the inside of the perimeter wall. There was no sign of any living soul out here. As we approached the outbuilding at the end of the row, Cotin selected a key from the ring at his belt and as he fiddled with the lock, I noticed a narrow path running along the inside of the wall. I followed the line of it as far as I could see and realised that it led straight to a small wooden door, set into the wall. This must be the gate I had seen from the towpath on the other side, where I had found the evidence of Paul’s death. I wondered what Cotin could want to show me here with such urgency.</p>
<p class="indented">He ushered me through the low doorway, peering back into the mist to make certain we were still alone. Once inside, he took down a lamp from a high shelf behind the door, drew out a tinder-box from inside his habit and struck the flint, lighting the stub of candle, before pulling the door closed behind us. Rodent feet scuttled away into the corners at the sound. As the flame took hold and flickered up the walls, I saw that we stood in a low, windowless storeroom, with wooden crates stacked along one side, casks and sacks piled up at the far end.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You say the priest was attacked close to the abbey gate,’ Cotin whispered, glancing around again as if we might be overheard.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I saw his blood on the track out there, by that door that leads to the jetty,’ I said.</p>
<p class="indented">He nodded, absorbing this, then gestured to a pile of crates in the far corner of the room. ‘My predecessor acquired over the years all manner of books and manuscripts from private collections. The most valuable went straight to the library, but the remainder could not be housed in the library archive, there was not the space. He died before he had a chance to catalogue them, so when I became librarian I inherited all these boxes that no one has looked through in perhaps thirty years.’ He swept a hand to encompass the volume of material. ‘Slowly but surely, I am working my way through, deciding which are worth the cost of repair. The answer is precious few, to my lasting regret – time has not been kind to them and many are suffering the ravages of damp, this place being so close to the river, even though they were packed in treated skins. At least the mice have spared them. But whoever decided to keep them in here should be thrown in the Bastille, in my view.’</p>
<p class="indented">He folded his arms and glared at the door, as if the culprit might appear at any moment. I motioned for him to continue. Intrigued as I was by the prospect of crateloads of forgotten manuscripts, with the Abbé already combing the grounds for me, I wanted him to come to the point.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Well.’ He twisted his hands together. ‘I came in yesterday after supper to make a start on the next pile. The atmosphere among the brothers was sombre after the death of the priest, you may imagine, but I had not thought – I mean to say, it was supposed that the poor man had been attacked by brigands on the road …’ He broke off to set the lantern down. Then he lifted off the topmost of the boxes, placing it on the floor before rummaging through the books in the crate beneath, from which he retrieved a bundle of rough brown cloth. ‘I pulled those boxes out and found this stuffed behind them. My first instinct was to leave it, since whoever put it there would surely come back to dispose of it more permanently. But my conscience … I don’t want to be mixed up in this business, Bruno,’ he said, his eyes bright with fear, ‘but if someone in this abbey …’ He shook his head and handed over the cloth, as if that were explanation enough, holding up the light so that I could see it more clearly.</p>
<p class="indented">The bundle was heavier than I had expected; I unfolded it carefully and understood the source of Cotin’s distress. I was holding a rough woven cloak, such as the abbey servants might wear; wrapped inside it was a statue of a saint, about eighteen inches high – Saint Denis, to be precise, staring up at me with blank eyes from the severed head he carried tucked under his own arm, his expression serene. He was carved from a block of white limestone, discoloured with age, the same stone as the walls and pillars of the abbey church; the sculptor’s art had once teased delicate details into the folds of his robe, the curls of his hair and beard and the braiding on his mitre, but his shoulders and the halo surrounding his empty neck had been smoothed and effaced by time and weather, and one of his feet was chipped away. Denis stood on a solid cuboid base, its edge stained with gobbets of bloody matter and a few strands of hair. I balanced it in my hands; it was easily heavy enough to strike a killing blow. I held up the cloak with the other hand; the front was spattered with dark blotches, now dried to a rust-brown crust. There could be little doubt as to the significance of these items. I looked up and met Cotin’s fearful gaze.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I haven’t told the Abbé. Do you think—’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Was this statue taken from the church?’</p>
<p class="indented">He shook his head.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Originally. But it has been in here for as long as I can remember. Those crates at the back there are full of bits and pieces from the church awaiting repair. Reliquaries, masonry, statues, candlesticks, glass. Anything that is no longer fit to glorify God is put here to be mended or else given away or the materials sold, though in practice it just gathers dust waiting to be sorted.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Whose job is that?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The sacristan’s.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Could one of the servants have come in here and taken it?’ I asked, indicating the cloak.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Almost certainly not. This storeroom is kept locked, only three of us have a key. Some of those sacred objects are valuable. The servants are not allowed to enter unless they are helping one of the brothers to move things.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Then who has access?’ I asked, eyeing the ring at his belt.</p>
<p class="indented">‘Myself, for the books. The almoner, Frère Joseph – he keeps the dry goods here that we distribute to the poor once a week at the back gate. And the sacristan.’ He paused, reluctant. ‘Frère Albaric. I believe you met him.’</p>
<p class="indented">I recalled that prickle of distaste I had felt on encountering Frère Albaric in the infirmary; his snide expression and shiny skin, the impatience with which he had tried to nudge me away from the dying priest’s bedside as he administered the last rites. <em class="calibre6">Dio cane</em> – had that been because he was afraid of what Paul might say to me? I looked down at the bloodied mess on the base of the statue. I must not jump to conclusions just because I had taken a dislike to the man.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And this Frère Joseph,’ I said. ‘What kind of man is he?’</p>
<p class="indented">Cotin snorted softly. ‘One that should not be in holy orders, in my view. The usual story – surplus son of a wealthy family. The one they give back to God, but no less full of worldly ambition for that. Joseph is a cold man. He barely troubles to disguise his contempt for the poor – hardly a desirable quality in an almoner. Of course, that may be why the Abbé appointed him,’ he added. ‘He has a reputation for frugality. The abbey’s profits have certainly improved since he began to review the distribution of alms to the needy.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘What age is he?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘A little younger than you. Not yet thirty-five, I think.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Which family?</p>
<p class="indented">‘His name is de Chartres. Parisians. He’s a cousin of the Duke of Montpensier. Well connected.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Ambitious, you say. Is he – let me speak bluntly – a man who might be persuaded to take a life if he thought it would help advance him?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I could not swear to that, Bruno. Who knows what any of us might do, given the right incentive? By temperament, perhaps …’ He hesitated, looking at the statue.</p>
<p class="indented">‘But?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Joseph has an affliction of his right hand. Some weakness from a childhood illness, he says. He can do everyday tasks competently enough with his good arm, but he lacks the strength for manual labour.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘So …’ I held the statue by the neck with my left hand and attempted to swing it through the air as if striking a blow. Paul Lefèvre was a tall man; if he had been standing when he was first hit, the assailant would have had to raise the statue above shoulder height before bringing it down. Saint Denis was heavy and unwieldy when held aloft with one hand. A strong man might be able to muster enough force for a killing blow one-armed, but it would be difficult to aim with any precision. Paul’s attacker could not have afforded to miss and risk the priest trying to fight back – especially if he lacked the strength to fight.</p>
<p class="indented">‘And Albaric?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Two good arms, as far as I know.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I meant, is he ambitious too? Political?’</p>
<p class="indented">Cotin looked unconvinced. ‘I do not know him well enough to say. I’m not sure anyone does, though he has been here eight or more years. He is devout in his duties, and that is all I can tell you, except that he guards his privacy, as far as one can in a community such as this. If he has political interests, I have no idea what they might be.’</p>
<p class="indented">For all that, he is certainly not politically naïve, I thought, recalling Albaric’s throwaway remark about looking to the Louvre to find the killer. It had struck me as an odd comment, given that at first Paul was assumed to be the chance victim of street robbers. He had known who Paul was, too, though he had affected only a vague recognition.</p>
<p class="indented">‘What about the back gate? Who has the key?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘All the senior officials whose work concerns deliveries to the abbey,’ he said. ‘Various goods come in by river to be unloaded at that jetty. So the two I have mentioned, but also the cellarer, the bursar, the infirmarian, among others. But it is not impossible that copies have slipped into other hands over the years.’ He allowed himself a half-smile. ‘In my day it was not unknown for younger friars to find their way out at night.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘In my day, too,’ I said, remembering my own nocturnal sorties in Naples. I looked back at the statue in my hands. ‘But why did he – whoever he was – not simply throw these in the river so they would not be found?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Perhaps he was interrupted,’ Cotin suggested. ‘If a boat came too close and he needed to hide himself, he may not have had time to throw the statue into deep water. Or perhaps he was afraid it would be noticed missing. He may have meant to clean it later and return it to its place.’ He dragged a hand across his beard, covered his mouth. ‘God have mercy.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Either way, he will be back for it,’ I said. ‘I am going to wait for him.’</p>
<p class="indented">He peeled his fingers away from his face and his mouth pinched. ‘You should not involve yourself in this any further, Bruno.’ He sighed. ‘By which I mean, I would prefer not to find myself in any more trouble with the Abbé as a result of your meddling. I have already defended you once.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Defended?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘The Abbé advanced the theory that the priest had spoken your name repeatedly not because he was asking for you, but because he was trying to accuse his killer. I insisted that was impossible, that you had been sitting under my nose in the library all afternoon. Even then I’m not sure he was persuaded. Either way he wants you questioned.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Thank you.’ I wondered who had planted that helpful idea in the Abbé’s mind. ‘But listen to me, Cotin. What are your choices? Will you go to the Abbé and tell him what you found here, or will you keep quiet in the knowledge that one of your brothers is a killer?’</p>
<p class="indented">The old man looked stricken. Neither prospect held much appeal. ‘It could have been a servant,’ he faltered. ‘A stolen key—’</p>
<p class="indented">I clicked my tongue, impatient. ‘Whoever struck Paul Lefèvre did it on behalf of someone more powerful, you can be sure. I’d be surprised if that person would have entrusted such a task to a servant. The Abbé will not thank you for drawing his attention to the scandal, if it was one of his friars. He may even have an interest in protecting the murderer. No one was supposed to find this evidence—’ I lifted the statue into his line of sight. ‘If you speak up about it, you may put yourself in danger. That’s why I should be the one to confront whoever comes back for this. Once I know who he is for certain, it will be for others to deal with and no one will connect it with you.’</p>
<p class="indented">He rolled his eyes. ‘Don’t be absurd, Bruno. Everyone will know I let you in here.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You just said yourself, a key might be stolen. Supposing you had left yours unattended in the library? I might well have helped myself. It’s the sort of thing they would expect of me.’</p>
<p class="indented">I cocked an eyebrow, waiting to see if I had convinced him. He regarded me with a tired smile.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You are relentless, Bruno. You propose to conceal yourself in here until he returns to dispose of the evidence. Then what? Will you accost him yourself? By whose authority?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘You can guess,’ I said quietly.</p>
<p class="indented">He pulled at his beard, looking doubtful. ‘You know the religious houses outside the city walls have their own jurisdiction. Unless you are carrying a royal seal, Henri’s name will not mean much here. It will be your word – a known heretic who has broken into abbey property – against that of a senior official of the order. Do you think the Abbé will meekly send for the royal guard at your request? Or is it more likely that you are the one who will end up detained?’</p>
<p class="indented">I sucked in my cheeks. He had a point. ‘Then I will not confront him. I will merely make sure I can identify him beyond doubt, and report what I know. It will be in the King’s hands after that. You’ll need to give me the key to the back gate, so I can escape.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘And by the time you have passed on what you know and the King’s guard arrives, that evidence will be gone, if you do not intervene.’ He spread his hands to indicate helplessness. ‘So it will be your word against the perpetrator’s once more. Henri will not send his soldiers barging into a powerful abbey and accusing a friar of murder without proof, not with rumours already flying that it was he who had the priest killed in the first place.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘Damn you, Cotin – you are right again.’ I closed my eyes for a moment while I considered. ‘Very well – we will do it this way. You must send a message to the Louvre palace as soon as possible. Address it to Jacopo Corbinelli, sign it from me. Tell him to ask the King to send two of his strong men, the two that know me, have them wait outside the abbey gate after Compline tonight. I don’t think our man will come looking for this until he can be sure he won’t be seen. Tell them to be discreet, and I will deliver the killer into their hands, with proof. I can pay you,’ I added, seeing his discomfort, though I knew that was not the issue.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I don’t want your money.’ He tutted, turning his head away. ‘This is your notion of keeping me out of it, eh?’ He hunched his shoulders, weighing up the price. ‘I know you need the King’s favour again, Bruno, but tell me – can you be certain he is blameless in this?’</p>
<p class="indented">I passed a hand over my face. ‘I can be certain of nothing, Cotin. Except that it seems beyond doubt that Paul Lefèvre was bludgeoned with this statue by someone who has access to this building and your back gate. That man is the only one who can tell us the truth about this business, and I mean to find him.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I would face severe discipline if the Abbé learns I was part of your escapade – which he will. I could lose my position. I know I owe you, but …’</p>
<p class="indented">He lowered his eyes. He did not need to say more; I knew what the risk meant to him. When I had first met Cotin, during my last stay in Paris, he had dreaded losing his office as librarian; too proud to admit that his sight was failing, he did his best to hide his deficiency from his brothers, living in fear of the day he could no longer read his beloved manuscripts. Through my friend Jacopo’s connections, I had had made for him a pair of eyeglasses that could magnify the smallest script; not such a great expense for my pocket at the time, but a luxury beyond the means of a friar sworn to a life of poverty. The instrument had restored Cotin to his work; now I was the one threatening it again.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I will not persuade you against your better judgement,’ I said, affecting unconcern. ‘Only consider this: how will it feel to look across the chapel every day during the office and catch the eye of one of your brothers, knowing he killed a man in cold blood?’</p>
<p class="indented">‘God’s tears, Bruno.’ He made a soft noise that might have been a curse, or a rueful laugh. ‘You know how to pluck at my conscience. Where do you want to hide yourself, then? I had better hurry with this message – they will be ringing the bell for Vespers any minute.’</p>
<p class="indented">I gripped his shoulder. ‘God will reward you, my friend. Or at least, I will, when I get the chance. Let us pile up those crates at the back and I’ll squeeze in behind them. That would give me a view of the door between the two stacks, providing he has a light with him.’</p>
<p class="indented">I indicated a recess at the back of the storeroom; together we pulled away misshapen sacks of root vegetables and shifted the crates of old masonry and ornaments into a stack the height of a man to cover it. I pressed in behind the boxes and the wall; cobwebs moulded across my mouth and nose and there was barely space to expand my lungs, but I would be concealed from anyone searching in the opposite corner behind Cotin’s boxes of books.</p>
<p class="indented">‘You’re well hidden,’ he said, standing back. ‘Now you just have to stay there for as long it takes, without needing a piss or falling asleep. Rather you than me.’ He eased a heavy iron key from the ring at his belt as I scraped out from the recess. ‘That’s for the back gate. For the love of God, don’t lose it. And you’d better take this one for the door here, in case your fellow locks it behind him when he leaves.’ He shook his head again. ‘I don’t like this, Bruno. If you should be caught off guard – this man is a killer, after all.’</p>
<p class="indented">‘I can put up a fight against any friar. Wouldn’t be the first time.’ I grinned, bending to show him the knife hidden in my boot; no weapons were permitted inside the abbey precinct, but the gatekeeper was usually too lazy or too bone-headed to bother with more than a cursory check of my belt. Cotin jumped back in alarm.</p>
<p class="indented">‘For Jesus’ sake, try not to shed more blood inside these walls. Come.’ He replaced the statue of Saint Denis, carefully wrapped in the cloak, in its original hiding place behind the boxes of books in the opposite corner. When it was secure, he opened the door a crack and held up his lantern, peering out and listening for any movement. ‘Quick.’ He nodded towards the path. ‘All quiet for now.’</p>
<p class="indented">The mist had thickened – or perhaps it was just that the light was already failing. It must be close to four in the afternoon. If I was right, and the killer would wait until the abbey was asleep, I could be standing behind those crates for six hours or more. I had survived worse, I told myself. By the corner of the outbuilding, I unlaced my breeches and relieved myself in a steaming stream on the grass, trying not to think that it might be my last opportunity for some time, while Cotin kept his eyes trained on the trees ahead. I nodded to him when I was ready, and he waited until I had taken my place again in the recess behind the crates.</p>
<p class="indented">‘I’ll stay in the library tonight after the lights go out,’ he said. I could just make out the shape of him through the gap between the stacks. ‘I have special permission to work there if I am unable to sleep – they will see nothing unusual in that. If you have any trouble, you will know where to find me. Pray God you’ll have no need. Get what you came for and leave quietly. I will find you at the Swan tomorrow after dinner to fetch the keys – best you stay clear of this place for a while. And take care of yourself,’ he added over his shoulder, his voice gruff to disguise his concern.</p>
<p class="indented">I smiled to myself in the shadows. The door closed behind him, leaving me in darkness as the lock clicked into place. I fidgeted until I found a position that allowed me to lean my weight against the wall and settled back to wait, reminding myself that the discomfort would be worth it, that in a matter of hours I would deliver both murderer and evidence into the King’s hands. After that, how they chose to persuade the man to implicate the Duke of Guise would be Henri’s concern. I allowed myself to dream a little of how the King might choose to reward me for my service.</p>
<p class="indented">Perhaps if I had been less cocksure about my ability to apprehend the killer single-handed, so that I could prove myself to the King and take the credit, the night would have unfolded differently and another death might have been avoided. But I run ahead of my story, and it does no good to speculate on what might have been.</p>
