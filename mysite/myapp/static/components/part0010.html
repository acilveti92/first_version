			<p class="bt-1st-para3">During the lengthy period when I lodged with my celebrated friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, our habit by common consent was to celebrate the holiday season in as quiet and Bohemian a manner as possible. As our establishment was a thoroughly bachelor one, we had little use for the more frivolous trappings of Yuletide, and my companion—when not frenetically engaged upon some dark and enigmatical criminal investigation which would drag us both into most un-Christmas-like environs—had a marked tendency to indolence during the winter months. The ennui which has always plagued him in the absence of brainwork was not, I fear, ever any lessened by grey skies and the soot-blackened snow beneath our sitting room window. Nor could I fail to notice that he made extra use of his Baker Street Irregulars as the banks of the Thames crusted over and made scavenging perilous, continually sending the urchins on petty errands and paying them at double rates during the storms. I myself have on occasion found London a strain upon the senses during its darkest months and had cause to reflect that, for a man of my friend’s minutely pitched sensitivities, the bleakness of its icy Decembers must have been grating in the extremest degree.</p>
			<p class="bt">During one such period, upon New Year’s Eve to be precise, I was returning home after a well-bundled evening constitutional and found myself veering in the direction of the dim and cozy wineshop we frequented in Marylebone Road. Though the hour was early enough yet that the skies gleamed a clear eggshell blue, the wind bore sharp fangs, and the holiday revelers were largely at home before their punch bowls or else in pubs before roaring hearthstones. The streets were therefore all but barren despite the festive date, and I slipped a coin into the tin cup of a bearded beggar as I turned the corner, feeling pensive and a trifle outside myself in the eerily calm thoroughfare. Stepping into the muted light and warmth of Eaker’s Festive Spirits revived me somewhat, and Mr. Eaker was his usual ebullient self, but I failed to linger there, instead selecting my purchases and at once making my way back to Baker Street, taking care not to slip on the slick cobbles in my renewed haste.</p>
			<p class="bt">It had been a circuitous outing which was of absolute necessity upon my part and which Holmes had dismissed with the barest flick of his agile fingers when I suggested it to him. He had not, I believe, quit the flat in some five days, having taken up semipermanent residence before the fire with his tobacco and his articles, interrupting himself only so far as to fling annoyingly peaceful pages of newsprint into the flames or to recline with an expression on his aquiline face of the utmost listlessness. When I poured tea, he drank it, and when I urged food upon him, he caustically suggested I volunteer in a soup kitchen so as to satisfy some of my more irritating quirks of nature outside the house. None of these signs were the least encouraging. I was, in short, growing concerned for his health, and it was this worry which propelled me back up our staircase with more alacrity than my chilled form would otherwise have attempted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I’ve been round to Eaker’s for a bottle of Imperial Tokay, and he assures me that this is the specimen required to toast the coming year properly,” I called from the doorway. I hung my hat upon its peg as I stamped, urging the blood to return to my extremities. “I must say, it’s appropriately dusty. We’ll lose no time in testing its reputation—just after I’ve polished it, I think. My gloves are positively filthy.”</p>
			<p class="bt">When I turned round, the sight I had for days been half-dreading and half-expecting met my eyes. Holmes stood at his desk, long limbs wrapped in his oldest dressing gown, holding the polished morocco leather case I could never glimpse without experiencing the strongest urge to throw it out the window, as it contained a tiny medical syringe used exclusively for unhealthful substances. Its loathsome shape never made an appearance when Holmes was working or in good spirits; its shadow haunted me, however, every time he slipped into despondence. Upon his glancing at me, my friend’s eyes narrowed appraisingly, lending to his countenance that aloof and uncannily calculating expression which inevitably causes one to feel like a particle trapped in one of his microscope slides.</p>
			<p class="bt">“For heaven’s sake, my dear Holmes,” I protested, setting the bottle heavily upon our sideboard.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Apologies, but to what exactly are you referring, my good man?” he replied lazily.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should have thought that was obvious.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Come now, I am no clairvoyant—spell it out for me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I refer to the clear indication that you are about to embark upon an activity which will only chip away at the very characteristic that makes you unique.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Everyone is unique, surely.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not the way you are,” I insisted, and for some reason the assertion, though admittedly ill-phrased, altogether pained me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ve just delivered the exact dictionary definition of the word ‘unique,’ I hope you’re aware.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, it’s New Year’s Eve.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Watson, despite the fact you have chided me in the past for having deliberately erased facets of everyday living from my mind to make room for bicycle tire patterns and odorless fatal poisons, I assure you that I can read a calendar.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are deliberately needling me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It isn’t my fault that you’re uttering a string of obvious non sequiturs. I suppose next you’re about to observe that that is a wicker-backed armchair.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I took a calming breath. “Fine. May I request that you refrain from dosing yourself?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, come, it isn’t as if I’ve any choice in the matter!” he cried. “For weeks now, nothing has taken place in this wretched city of any appreciable interest, never mind a genuinely stimulating effect upon the faculties. These people wandering aimlessly about beyond our windows—think of the nefarious schemes, the harrowing choices, the miraculous happenstances that ought to take place hourly in a city of millions of beings crammed up against one another, and so far as I can tell from the latest editions, their imaginations extend no further than to marry each other, assault each other, or otherwise degrade each other. Where is the scope, where is the creative spark, what is the <span class="charoverride3">point</span> of a proficiency like mine if it cannot be put to any <span class="charoverride3">use</span>?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It has been invaluable in the past and it will be again soon. You must trust in this, and have a little patience, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Patience?” he scoffed. “I am unique, you tell me, and more so than everyone else—which is a grammatical impossibility, by the way, and I have heard rumor that you dabble in published prose from time to time, but never mind—very well, I am unique. If my fate is to be caged indoors staring at household furnishings, utterly sterile news reports, and an Army pensioner reading yellow-backed novels a child would dismiss as overly sensational, allow me at least some clarification of my thought processes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">My jaw tensed, but I soldiered on. “Setting aside the rest, which doesn’t bear discussion, temporary clarification of your thought processes with after-effects of gradual but sure damage hardly seems to me the best method of ringing in the New Year, particularly in the case of a man who lives by his legendary wits,” I replied tartly, stung despite my familiarity with Holmes’s black humors. “But in any case, I’ll leave you to it. Apparently the respective vistas within our parlor have grown equally distasteful to the pair of us, so I shall take myself out of the picture and solve both of our problems simultaneously. A happy New Year to you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">As infrequently as Holmes and I quarrel, and as comprehensively as I esteem my distant and masterful friend, I was in that moment desirous of nothing more than sharing a quiet pint with a fellow creature better suited to polite conversation and seasonal cheer. It felt nothing like a retreat, but rather like a tactical decision to approach the fray from a position of greater advantage and at a more salubrious time. In fact, I was already returning my hands to my dirtied gloves, wondering whether I should patronize one of our local watering holes or hail a cab to escape the tedium of our niche of Westminster, when a commanding tenor halted me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Stop.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I hazarded a glance back. Holmes was staring speculatively at the wine bottle, arms crossed and his head proudly tilted to one side like a sleek raven’s. Since I could not imagine what he was about to say, I waited in silence.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Eaker’s supply of Imperial Tokay is superior to most, but the best I ever encountered was hand-selected by a wine merchant named Vamberry. He sold remarkable vintages and indeed shipped them the world over. The highest potentates of no fewer than ten sovereign principalities consulted with him when seeking rare specimens for their private collections.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, doubtless the wine likewise fails to meet your high standards. Good night, Holmes.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He was robbed of a beautiful set of Medieval sheet music illuminations, the pride of his life, indeed the most precious objects on earth so far as he was concerned, and he asked me to find them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How very fortunate for you, if not for him. If you’ll excuse me—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
			<p class="bt">My temper had been tested so far already that I might have taken umbrage at this laughably transparent ploy to lure me into the role of captive audience, a mere prop for my friend’s considerable ego, had it not been for two things. First, I can never elicit accounts of Holmes’s cases prior to our acquaintance save when he is in a particular frame of mind, and such tales interest me extremely. When I ask to hear about them, he is as shy and elusive as a sheltered maiden, and when I least expect the miraculous to take place, he will launch into accounts of his fledgling career that are every bit as rousing as the finest adventure tales at which he so openly sneers. Whether he is truly reticent or deliberately coy I do not know, but the effect is identical: I thrill at the mere thought of those lost tales. As for the second factor, Holmes replaced the morocco case in the desk drawer and banged it shut, striding to the sideboard and pulling two wineglasses from the shelf. He dangled them by their stems, watching them catch the firelight whilst wearing an uncertain expression that looked very odd on him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I should prefer not to lose your company, provided you can tolerate mine,” he said quietly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Tolerating you is a skill at which I’m rather deft.” I slowly drew off my gloves again, for while my friend is often so abrasive, he is seldom so aware of the fact. The mere cognizance that he had all but driven me out of my own flat on New Year’s Eve was a sign of improvement, and I cherish such budding suggestions that spring will come as it always does. “I can at least assure you that an account of your early work would be very tolerable indeed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He ventured a flicker of a smile which failed to reach his eyes. It was, once more, better than nothing. “You’re far too kind.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Nonsense. You already know that I love to hear of your first cases.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, I meant that sentiment in the general rather than the specific sense. But my blushes. I did gather that you enjoyed them.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“They’re very engaging. That is, provided you don’t plan to reduce the anecdote to a dry mathematical diagram, or a lecture in Latin on the practical application of logical abstractions, I shall be content,” I teased, settling into my armchair.</p>
			<p class="bt">This time his smile, though rueful, was lingering. “A touch, a touch, I do confess it, Watson. Well, we shall see what I can do to spin a yarn for my own biographer. Make yourself comfortable, and thaw your feet, and I’ll present to you the facts of the case.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Passing me a now-full glass of Tokay, Holmes curled himself into his own chair like a diffident feline. He balanced the measure of golden liquid upon his knee and peered into it as if divining a fortune. When he finally took a sip, his face cleared a little in surprise. I was, I confess, amused.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It may not be from this Vamberry chap’s establishment,” I ventured, savoring the complexity of the flavor coating my tongue, “but it will serve.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“By Jove, it certainly will.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Eaker insisted that it was a superb selection.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I shall pop round tomorrow and clean out his remaining stock for us.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That would be admirable,” I owned, knowing an apology when I heard one. “You were telling me a tale, however.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, of course.” He cleared his throat, ever the showman. “After I left college, as you know, I had it firmly fixed in my mind that I should make my living solving the conundrums which so often seem indecipherable to the earnest but unimaginative men of the Metropolitan Police.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And with some success from the outset.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Some. Unfortunately, no one had ever heard of me, and my researches hardly fattened my bank account, so that by the time you met me—the case in question took place mere weeks before, in February of eighteen eighty-one—my financial outlook was less sanguine than a gentleman likes to contemplate. It had, in fact, reached the level of personal embarrassment.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You’ll recall I was in similar straits myself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes,” said he, the ghost of an impish light dawning in his grey irises. “Forgive me for mentioning it, Watson, but your skills as a medico were rather wasted upon mending aged handkerchiefs.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course you noticed that,” I sighed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was no reflection on your neatness, merely one upon your indifferent thread choice. My own stabs at frugality would have been hardly less obvious to the trained observer. In any case, a fellow who fancies his digs a private practice likes to have a small selection of spirits on hand, for himself as well as his clients, and I soon identified Mr. Uriah Vamberry as the most reasonably priced vendor in the area despite his fame. Every month or so, I would pay him a call, and after several such occasions he came to take an interest in me. I suppose I must have been a bit of a melancholy figure, callow and bookish to a fault, and old Vamberry often engaged me upon the subject of my highly eccentric lines of study.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“If you bothered to answer, you must have liked him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I suppose I did.” Holmes swirled his wine, pondering. “He loved music and the rare, mysterious artifacts associated with song. Whenever I spoke of my violin dabblings, he became particularly voluble—his prized possession was a Medieval musical codex in six pages, embellished in the most fantastical array of peacock greens and purples and sapphires, meticulously framed and kept in the back room away from harmful light, hung above the rarest of the distilled spirits as if crowning the collection. The inking was phenomenally detailed, and the gilt work dazzling. It notated a <span class="charoverride3">rondet de carole </span>by none other than Adam de la Halle and, though dated in the fifteenth century long after his death, was of such exquisite rendering that I never set foot in the shop without devoting a few minutes of my own attention to Vamberry’s prized possession.</p>
			<p class="bt">“He would have intrigued you, Watson. He was a cunning little chap, stooped over as if he were perennially inhaling the essence of a rare vintage, with a pale face lined with countless fine wrinkles like a spreading network of cobwebs, and great blue eyes staring out from a pair of silver spectacles. In addition to his more exalted clients, the scholars from the British Museum all consulted him upon their wine cellars, for he’d an expert palate and fair prices, while I relied upon his expertise and good nature to supply my decanters with something more respectable than gin.</p>
			<p class="bt">“On one such visit—as I said, less than a month prior to being introduced to the estimable fellow who would make my name known internationally—I arrived outside his shop to find Vamberry greatly upset, pacing the pavement before his window. It was obvious that a blow of some significance had befallen him. His usually papery complexion was painted with furious spots of color, his spindly limbs trembled, and as I approached, he suddenly leaned against the brick wall.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Mr. Vamberry, whatever is troubling you?’ I inquired urgently.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I cannot credit it, I simply cannot!’ he cried without greeting me. ‘That I should be abused in such a way!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘But what has happened?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I have been robbed, Mr. Holmes! Cruelly and shamelessly robbed!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“As you can well guess, Watson, my ears pricked up considerably at this news. For Vamberry had often been kind to me, unsociable as I am, and here was a chance to attempt repaying him.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And to involve yourself in a crime,” I could not help but remark shrewdly.</p>
			<p class="bt">Sighing, Holmes passed his fingers over the bridge of his nose. “I don’t deny that motive, though I didn’t invent the other.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Of course not.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But I don’t begrudge your getting a bit of your own back.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I shook my head. “Detection is your passion, not merely your profession, and noting that is not a pejorative.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh—I beg your pardon. I seem at odds with everything and everyone tonight.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I know, and my apologies for interrupting. Pray continue.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Mr. Vamberry, when did you find your codex was missing?’ I questioned. ‘Surely that is what’s been stolen, for you have never spoken so feelingly of even the rarest vintage, and the loss of a single day’s till would hardly trouble you this much.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I’m not meant to be here today at all!’ he told me in a fierce whisper. ‘I wanted something a bit unusual to share with old friends this evening, and I stopped by for a bottle, and—heavens, it was horrible, my first glimpse of the back room.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Obviously, Watson, my first thought was of Vamberry’s two clerks, Evers and Manente—for Vamberry’s hours were quite regular, and his shop was full of valuable wares and thus locked in the most secure manner by night. The place was a veritable fortress, with iron bars across both the ground- and the first-floor windows, a double locking mechanism on the front door, and a fenced back area with a very heavy padlock upon the rear entrance. It seemed that either one employee, or the two of them in concert, had taken advantage of a felicitous opportunity, and I hinted as much.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Yes, I’ve just now sent a lad to fetch a constable,’ said he, wringing his badly palsied hands. ‘My clerks are within, in my office. Both claim not to have set foot in that room today at all, having had no cause to do so. They are both clever, quick boys, just as you are, and I have been teaching them all I know of oenology—I cannot bear to think one of them has betrayed me.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I may not be much experienced,’ I told him eagerly, ‘but I have often seen what is invisible to others, and I should be happy to lend you my eyes, with your permission, before the official police arrive. The sooner evidence is gathered, the better chance we have of recovering your property.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Vamberry readily agreed, and we made it our business first to check all the windows and locks, which showed no sign of having been tampered with. Then we hastened to the display room where the robbery had occurred, lined floor to ceiling with the palest golden brandies, cognacs, and liqueurs. The six empty frames sat neatly stacked upon the polished wooden floor, and the sight of them caused poor Vamberry to muffle a small sound of distress. Save for the missing codex, despite my best efforts, I could see nothing out of the ordinary whatsoever, not a bottle askew nor a scratch on the shelving, which again suggested to me that the culprit was neither rushed nor unfamiliar with his surroundings. Vamberry’s establishment was always immaculately dusted, unfortunately, so I’d no help from that quarter either.</p>
			<p class="bt">“But all my instincts informed me that the theft had been carefully planned. I began to fear in earnest that the codex was irretrievable, for if either clerk had removed the sheets and then made use of an accomplice posing as a customer in the other’s absence, the confederate could simply have carried the papers away in a briefcase with no one the wiser.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Bending to examine the floor, I grew still more discouraged, for the weather had been cold but clear and no impressions of muddied tracks were to be found. In fact, a single piece of data presented itself, and little enough to go on: it was a tiny scrap of loose cotton wool, barely more than a thread, and I pocketed this with every intention of showing it to the Yarders when they arrived.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Swiftly, I also searched the front room, which was where the bottles of lesser value were displayed and the register sat proudly on a mahogany counter. When I rummaged through the contents of the dustbin beneath, imagine my surprise when I discovered considerably more cotton wool, masses of it, and damp to the touch. I hadn’t the faintest notion what to make of this, but filed it away for after I had questioned my suspects.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I had at first been fighting twinges of lingering vexation, but was by now entirely engrossed in my companion’s story. “As you say, this all looks very dark for one of the clerks.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Granted, I was determined not to disregard other possibilities, but it is foolishness rather than broad-mindedness not to examine the most obvious suspects first.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How did you approach them?”</p>
			<p class="bt">Taking a demure sip of Tokay, his deep-set eyes regaining a hint of their natural mischievousness, Holmes answered, “I solicited their help, of course.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Smiling, I raised my glass. “Recruitment—the best interrogation technique known to the independent investigator.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Exactly, Watson! I asked Vamberry if he could hold any arriving police at bay whilst I spoke to them briefly, each in private. He was agreeable and at once led me to the office. The senior clerk, a Mr. Aloysius Evers, had been with him for some five years, and sat quietly filling out orders for their European suppliers. Meanwhile Mr. Antonio Manente, the junior clerk of some two months’ standing who manned the stockroom, paced along one wall like a wildcat trapped in a cage. The demeanors of the two men could not have been more diametrically opposed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh, hello, Mr. Holmes,’ Evers said, wiping a smudge of ink from his fingers with a kerchief as he emerged from behind the desk to greet us.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Evers was a short, husky fellow with a round face, a milky blond complexion, and a habit of conducting conversations with his gaze riveted to his hands, which were constantly in motion. He would glance periodically at his listener, but more often he was scratching away in the ledger, brushing a cloth over the register and counter, dusting the stock, et cetera. Though he was friendly in a forgettable way and popular with the clientele, I had always enjoyed my conversations with Vamberry to the point where I had paid Evers scant attention. Now I read a residence near the wineshop in his boots, and ‘Durham University’ in his tiepin.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Mr. Vamberry has been filling you in, has he?’ Mr. Evers shook my hand. ‘Dreadful business, absolutely appalling, and without any sign whatsoever of a break-in. We don’t know what to think, sir.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Mr. Antonio Manente abruptly ceased his pacing to listen to his colleague. Since he primarily kept the back stock organized and unloaded deliveries, I’d not often glimpsed him, and I was deeply struck by his appearance. You know, Watson, that I hardly ever look anyone in the eye at a level angle, and this chap was well over six feet. His hair was cut very close and yet curled into tenaciously thick tangles like the wool of a black lamb, and his dark brows were painted finely over keenly alert brown eyes. He had clasped his hands in a polite but unnatural manner behind his back, and when he turned to resume his anxious wanderings, I saw that they twitched worriedly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘But there must have been a break-in. Please say it is so,’ he requested in the warm, avid timbre of the native Sicilian.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I fear not,’ Mr. Vamberry replied, visibly woeful, ‘though we have only Mr. Holmes’s facility to go on so far. Perhaps the official police will see something he has missed.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“This was a farcical suggestion, Watson, but I for decorum’s sake held my tongue.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Is it not then possible that a customer has made off with them while we worked?’ Mr. Manente exclaimed in shriller tones.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I hardly think so,’ Mr. Evers put in ruefully, resuming his seat. ‘That’s what makes this all so dashed disconcerting. They’d have to have been bold as brass—the frames are still here, and it must have taken some little effort to remove the pages. But perhaps an expert lockpick came in the dead of night and took all the time he wanted over the heist, leaving few traces. We can only hope the police discover some clue as to the villain’s identity.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Police, ha—God, I wish there were no need for them, but perhaps you speak true.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘It’s the suspense that has me rattled and nothing more, though of course I regret your loss very much, Mr. Vamberry. I say search us both top to toe and be done with it.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Disgraceful!’ the other exclaimed, eyes wide. ‘Why should I be searched? I have done nothing, I tell you, nothing!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Come, Manente, calm yourself. Surely you need not object to a search if you’re guiltless.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Oh, I couldn’t search either one of you unless as a <span class="charoverride3">very </span>last resort, lads,’ Mr. Vamberry protested tremulously.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Very good of you too, sir,’ said Evers, ‘though if it becomes necessary, you must not hesitate simply to spare our feelings, eh, Manente?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Manente’s lips pursed in agreement, but he remained silent, and I sensed tension between the two workers which had nothing to do with the uncomfortable situation in which they found themselves.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Gentlemen, I wonder if you would agree to assist me, as your testimony might well prove invaluable and Mr. Vamberry prizes your judgment and discretion so,’ I appealed to them. ‘He has agreed to let me pose you one or two queries, in an effort to avoid any unpleasantness in the police court, if possible, and to attempt to learn all we can before they arrive. Have you any objection? I should be very grateful for your aid, both of you—I am a student of the art of detection, and have solved some dozens of crimes without the aid of the Yard.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘By Jove, an amateur sleuth!’ Evers exclaimed as he patted a stack of papers into order.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Consulting detective,’ I could not help correcting him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Eh? Well, whatever you call it, I am more than happy to assist. Manente?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Question as you like.’ He shrugged, but a twitch below his left eye betrayed his discomfiture. ‘I’ve stolen nothing and wish only to see this quickly finished.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Thank you. Your help will be most beneficial for everyone involved, I hope. If I might question Mr. Evers confidentially first, and then Mr. Manente.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“The others promptly left us, and I sat down at the side of the desk opposite to Evers, crossing my legs and giving him a thorough study. He smiled at me briefly, then returned his attention to his pen, ink, and blotter, rearranging them.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘It is a shame that one of your shipments of wine was discovered to be poorly corked this morning,’ I began in a friendly fashion.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Evers at once glanced up again. ‘How on earth did you guess that?’ he exclaimed. ‘Do you know, you might really make something of this detective business, sir. Yes, a case of Chianti arrived and proved after inspection to be absolutely undrinkable. Some spoilage is inevitable, of course, but this was disappointing. How did you know?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘You’ve a faint scattering of minuscule red spots on your trouser leg, just where a fine spray of red wine would land if you were depositing an inferior product down the drainage grate. I can hardly think how else you could come by such a stain. Apart from that, you are presently requesting reimbursement from the vintner,’ I added with a wry nod at his ledger. ‘Cork taint is the only possible suspect when it comes to the disposal of unsold stock—so you see, there is no mystery in it.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘None at all.’ He laughed. ‘But how you baffled me. I’d thought you very clever indeed for a moment.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I may not be clever, but I confess myself surprised. By reading upside-down I can see that it was a Nacarelli shipment you found lacking. You may have observed that I’ve purchased wine from that vineyard myself, and always found it quite palatable. Even Mr. Vamberry recommends it.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Winemaking is a delicate enough procedure that the best of houses can sometimes find themselves in the wrong. But you seem not to be questioning me upon the subject at hand, Mr. Holmes.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘True enough. Frankly, I cannot credit you as the culprit.’ I shrugged, affecting to brush a thread from my trouser leg with a bored expression. ‘Had you wanted that codex, surely you would have made your move years ago. You have worked here for some time, have you not?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Five years, Mr. Holmes.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Quite so. I only wanted to know what you thought of Mr. Manente.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Ah.’ Evers leaned back in his chair, looking regretful. ‘You saw his demeanor earlier. He seems most . . . disturbed at the notion of a personal search. I don’t know him at all well, I’m afraid, since we work at such disparate tasks here and he is not the most convivial of men. As for myself, I only wish Mr. Vamberry would empty our pockets and raid our briefcases, for I’ve nothing to hide in this sordid business.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Even if you are not confidential with Mr. Manente, can you tell me more about him? Do you know of any debts to his name, any stain upon his character?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Evers fiddled with the pen, bit his lower lip, and gave every indication that he disliked this line of questioning. ‘I wish I could say no, Mr. Holmes. But I fear I cannot divulge what I’ve learned of his past to you either. I’m sorry, for I did promise to assist, but you understand that I don’t want to see him judged unfairly, even though we are not close. After you’ve spoken with him, depending upon his candor . . . well, well, perhaps then I’ll be forced to betray his confidence, but not before.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“After this exchange, I sent Evers on his way and called in Mr. Manente. He was in a most pitiable state of nerves, Watson, with hands once again clasped behind him, and his rich complexion faded to ash. I reached out my own hand in greeting, and he took it readily enough, however, with a firmness of grip which suggested that his agitation was not due to any innate weakness of character.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I hope not to keep you terribly long. Mr. Manente, how did you pass your day?’ I began.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Unpacking crates, sorting stock, cleaning,’ he said dully. Rather than take the chair Evers had vacated, he resumed pacing. ‘I will not stand for this, I tell you. To be treated like a rat or a dog. I will <span class="charoverride3">not </span>have my property searched, and that is all. My conscience is clear, whether Mr. Evers thinks so or not.’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely this attitude seemed very odd to you,” I put in, moving to replenish our supply of Tokay. A little of the color had returned to my friend’s bone-white complexion, a happy sign to say the least. “Why should an innocent man act so guiltily, if not because he had counted upon Mr. Vamberry’s absence that day and then found himself in danger of discovery?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Why, indeed,” Holmes agreed, holding out his glass. “Well, I am afraid that I required the answer to that identical question urgently. ‘Mr. Manente,’ said I, ‘I know all about your criminal record, and I am prepared to overlook it after you’ve told me truthfully about the contents of your briefcase, whatsoever those contents may be.’ ”</p>
			<p class="bt">My jaw dropped, and Holmes laughed. “Mr. Manente bore an expression not dissimilar to yours, my dear Watson, though his was tinged with considerably more fear. When he asked me how I knew of such a thing, his breath strained and his knees quivering, I told him readily enough. You see, I don’t believe that Mr. Manente was hiding his hands from me deliberately—on the contrary, he was indulging a nervous tic. But I had determined that I should scrutinize them more closely, and when I had shaken his hand, I’d felt a series of callosities along the flesh of his upper palm. I’d also caught a glimpse of the skin at his collar, and that rather proved the point conclusively.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then I should be grateful to know what point, and how it was proved.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“With pleasure. He had been operating either a plow, a handcart, or a treadmill, and recently. Even so raw and untested as I was, I felt them at once—deep lateral hardenings of the pad directly below the fingers—but I might have taken him for a former farmer or stevedore if I’d not noted his skin coloration.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Which was significant in what fashion?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“His pigmentation was darker far than mine, but neither damaged by sun nor roughened by wind, and, I observed, very faintly paler when his head turned and his collar shifted. An old, faded summer’s demarcation but a clear one. I cannot believe that any farmer would wear a paper collar in the field, nor can I picture one on the men pushing handcarts down at the quays. In the dock, when a man is put to hard labor, it is almost always indoors. He had always previously dressed as a gentleman, and roughened his hands while serving his time.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Wonderful!” I exclaimed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Surely superficial to one such as yourself, who knows my methods,” he said, but I caught the glint of pride in his steely eye. “And yet, marvelous enough that Manente all but collapsed into the chair at last.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Try to ruin me, then,’ said he, fiercely. ‘I can see that you and Evers are in it together. But I know my own character, even if—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Softly, for heaven’s sake!’ I interrupted him. ‘Now. Six months’ hard labor is my guess, judging by the callosities on your hands, and I assure you that Evers has told me nothing as yet, though he strongly hinted he knew more than he said. What were you booked for?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Manslaughter with a reduced sentence,’ he answered hoarsely. ‘I’d have served ten times that, by God—though if true justice had been done, I’d have been a free man after the trial. It was a pig died, not a human, and it broke its own neck without my aid.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Finally, Watson, my brain managed to slot two pieces of the puzzle together; I was not then quite so trained in my mental acuity as now, and the necessary data had been teasing at the edge of my mind in the most maddening fashion. But I have always devoured the London dailies with considerable appetite, and Manente’s story flooded suddenly and completely into my mind.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Christina Manente,’ I supplied. ‘Your sister—she testified at trial to having been pursued for months by a drunken brute from the neighborhood. She was dogged relentlessly by the fiend and had become terrified to so much as set foot outdoors. On the last occasion you evicted him from her presence, he fell down the stairs in a drunken stupor, and his mother brought charges of murder against you, saying you pushed him deliberately. The press made something of a lurid romance of it. I take it you said nothing of your role in this drama to Mr. Vamberry?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘The last five establishments would not hire me when I was forthright. So I was silent. I have a wife, children. Must they starve because I love my sister also?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I take it that something to do with your past presently resides in your briefcase?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Court documents. I am due to meet the bailsman this evening to make a final payment, then all will be over and done with.’ Learning forward exhaustedly, he rubbed at his temples. ‘Do you suppose me a thief, Mr. Holmes?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Not a bit of it. I suppose Mr. Evers an opportunist.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Why so?’ he asked. ‘I do not like him—he flatters the customers and persuades them to buy wines they cannot afford. But never have I had reason to think him a criminal.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Any clever man who planned to steal a work of art, knowing that he would be one of two prime suspects, would act only if he thought he could make the other appear guilty. I posit that Evers recognized you from the newspapers and hit on the lucky notion of framing a guiltless man. He seems to fear nothing from a search, so he must be absolutely sure of his hiding place.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘In any event, I am ruined. If Mr. Vamberry opens my briefcase—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘It won’t come to that,’ I said, a rush of confidence overwhelming me as I leapt to my feet. A sudden inspiration had struck. ‘We shall circumvent a search altogether, with luck on our side. Follow me!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“We hurried into the front room, where Vamberry and Evers stood with a most impatient-seeming officer of the Yard. Almost at once, I saw what I was looking for—a small crate of wine sat upon a handcart, ready for delivery. The bottles within were of a very dark green hue, which of course you recognize was of the utmost importance, Watson.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I don’t know who the devil this Sherlock Holmes is, or thinks he is,’ the policeman was declaring, ‘but if you want my help—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I see you’ve a delivery to make, Mr. Evers,’ I interjected. ‘Six bottles, and the glass of very heavy Italian manufacture. I don’t wonder that you’ve elected to use a cart.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“He went pale at this, though his posture remained unchanged. ‘I don’t see why it should interest you,’ he muttered.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Only because of late I have been practicing feats of physical strength,’ I returned casually. ‘Let me provide you all with a demonstration of my progress.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“With that, I lifted the crate and balanced the whole of it upon one palm.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I could not contain a peal of laughter at my companion’s all too typical theatrics, and he grinned easily in return.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Quite a commotion ensued, my dear chap, for Evers knew the game was up and made as if to run for it, and the policeman had a sprightly time of wrestling him into a pair of darbies. You see by now what had happened. The wine Evers discarded had been perfectly drinkable. He required the bottles for their opacity and, after washing them out, had dried them thoroughly with the cotton wool I’d discovered. What better way to spirit the codex out of a wine store than inside bottles of wine? When Vamberry opened them, he at once found his treasure, rolled up in six sheets of black paper within the glass.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He must have been very grateful to you indeed.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Oh, he was,” Holmes owned, chuckling. “He gave me as a reward a case of excellent brandy, which you might possibly recollect from your earliest days at Baker Street.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Good heavens, yes—that brandy was outstanding. It must have taken us three years to finish it all.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Two years, eight months, I think. Anyhow, when his scheme fell to pieces, a desperate and vengeful Evers revealed Manente’s secret past and claimed that his fellow clerk hid the codex in the bottles, but his groundless accusations came to nothing; I made sure of it. Evers was soon found to have lost a small fortune in wild speculation, and of course Vamberry was too good a chap to sack Manente for nothing, as I’d supposed all along. Manente was most effusive in his gratitude, and soon thereafter had ended his dealings with the Yard and celebrated his freedom with a promotion from the estimable Vamberry to head clerk. A man guilty of nothing save protecting his loved ones freed, a cunning schemer exposed, a gentleman’s property restored, and a pair of bachelors ensconced in new Westminster lodgings with a truly outstanding supply of spirits. A salubrious ending in every manner, eh?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Absolutely first-rate, my dear fellow,” said I, angling my glass to him. “My cap is off to you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It was a very simple matter,” he demurred. “But suitable for a leisurely tale on a cold winter’s night.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I slipped into a reverie, as will inevitably happen at the closing of a year, and thought about my friend and his incredible talent, and about the incalculable number of Londoners who had at one time or another appealed to him for help when the darkness appeared to have closed in upon them irrevocably. It would be a travesty and a disgrace, I mused, if I—a medical professional and one in the singular position of calling myself his friend—could not wean him of the habits which would ultimately destroy his incomparable powers, no matter the frustrations and the setbacks that such a project would surely entail. If I would do as much to save a stranger from self-destruction, how much more would I do for Sherlock Holmes? Finishing my wine, as nightfall’s ashen clouds gathered outside our window, I determined anew to stop at nothing in this worthy aim. With the sense of calm which follows such resolutions, I glanced up to find myself the subject of minute study by the most prescient observer of the age.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What is it, Holmes?” I inquired.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not this year, I’m afraid, my dear fellow,” my friend said softly, reading my train of thought as easily as he would read letters on a signpost. His eyes fell back to his knee. “But perhaps one year. Though to be entirely honest, I have my doubts.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And I have my hopes,” said I. “We shall see who emerges victorious.”</p>
