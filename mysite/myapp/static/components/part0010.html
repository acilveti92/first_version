				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Captain Danbury, what a delightful surprise.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack Lark did his best to look composed as he was led into the office of his new commanding officer. He nodded his thanks to the khansama who had ushered him into the spacious room. The shuffling figure bowed obsequiously, his hand fluttering across his face, his discomfort at being thanked obvious.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No need to thank the damn steward. You quite made his day by not cuffing him around the ears.’ The officer seated behind the monstrous mahogany desk rose to his feet, his wide-backed chair scraping noisily across the highly polished wooden floor.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Proudfoot.’ He thrust his hand forward forcefully.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Danbury.’ Jack did his best to hide his amusement at the curt introduction, giving his assumed name with as much confidence as he could summon. He took the hand offered to him, shaking it firmly whilst wondering at the strange figure welcoming him to his new post.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot was close to a foot shorter than Jack. Behind the bushy beard and thick moustache his face bore the evidence of a long time spent in the East, a craggy network of creases, folds and wrinkles that made him appear older than his forty-one years.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Yet it was not his premature age alone that made him fascinating. Jack studied with growing amusement the strange attire his new commander wore, the contrast to his own regimental uniform stark. Proudfoot chose to dress as a nabob, with a flowing, richly decorated tunic over baggy pantaloons. A fine web of coloured thread spread over the cream linen, creating intricate patterns that rippled and moved as he returned to his seat behind the slab of mahogany that was more comparable to a dining table than the humble working desk of an official in the East India Company.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">A slight grimace of distaste on his face made it clear he had noticed the wry scrutiny of his choice of clothes.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Take a seat.’ Proudfoot indicated a fine leather chair opposite his own. He followed the invitation by bellowing at the pankha-wala, a young boy of no more than ten who sat in the corner of the room, pulling on a thick cord that moved the large sail attached to the ceiling back and forth, wafting a gentle breeze down on to the official and his guest. Chastened by his master’s rebuke, the boy bent his head so that his forehead was an inch away from the floor, whilst his wiry arms increased the tempo of the fan’s motion.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Now, to business.’ Proudfoot gathered up the documents he had been working on and shuffled them into an ordered pile before placing them neatly to one side. He took a moment to line them up so they were perfectly perpendicular to a small stack of similar thick cream papers waiting for his attention. ‘So, Danbury. Why aren’t you dead?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The question was delivered deadpan, without a trace of humour or warmth.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack’s face remained collected while he thought about the odd question, even though his heart was racing ten to the dozen as he felt the strings of his new life unravelling before it had even begun. ‘Would you care to explain that remark, sir?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘What I mean, my dear fellow,’ Proudfoot smiled, but with little evidence of good humour, ‘is that I received a letter just a few days ago regretfully informing me that the recent purchaser of the vacant commission in the 24th had died in the Crimea, and that I was to expect notice of a new purchaser within the month. You are meant to be dead, Danbury. Quite dead.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I’m sorry to disappoint you, sir, but as you can see, I’m very much alive.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Indeed. So I see. The paperwork will be quite incorrect now, damn it,’ Proudfoot cursed, his irritation obvious. ‘Well, I suppose it cannot be helped. I shall be forced to write a letter to the Governor’s office to let them know of the change of circumstances. It really would’ve been simpler if you were dead.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack smiled. ‘Not for me.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot stared hard, his eyes searching Jack’s face for a sign of insubordination. He scowled, clearly displeased with whatever he saw there, then turned his attention to his steel pen, fastidiously wiping clean the nib, meticulously removing every vestige of ink. When he was quite satisfied, he placed the pen on the top of the closest pile of documents, his hand immediately returning to it to fussily ensure that it was lined up at right angles to the top of the papers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Welcome.’ Proudfoot delivered the belated greeting with gusto, as if he had resolved to start the conversation afresh and put Jack’s inconvenient health to one side. ‘Welcome to Bhundapur.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Thank you. I’m pleased to be here at last. It has been a long journey.’ Jack hid his relief. He felt his unease begin to fade. It was unsettling to hear that Proudfoot had not been expecting Danbury’s arrival, but he had a feeling the wheels of government would run slowly on the frontier of the Empire. He could only hope that Proudfoot’s letter would create enough confusion to make sure he was safe, for the time being at least. Once settled at Bhundapur, he could do his best to make sure that confusion continued, and hope that no one would look to find a replacement for an officer who had already arrived.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Indeed. We are glad to have you with us.’ Proudfoot eased back in his chair, more comfortable now the conversation had turned towards less irregular matters. ‘We are a small band but we all rub along quite nicely. As I’m sure you are aware, I’m the only political officer here. I report directly to the Governor, but other than that, I am pretty much left to my own devices.’ He shrugged his shoulders in a theatrical gesture of modesty, before shaking his head as if unable to comprehend quite how he managed to cope with such a challenging remit. ‘When you think that this area is the size of half a dozen English counties put together, you will begin to understand the task at hand. As you will know, I run the affairs of the Company in Sawadh. I am the commander of all the forces here, both military and police. I am both magistrate and superintendent of law and I am even in charge of the jail itself. I run the treasury and am responsible for all our accounts whilst also being both the assessor and collector of taxes. For all public works I am executive engineer as well as superintendent. I am postmaster, commissioner of the ordinance and I even supervise the mule train and the company bullocks. In short, Danbury, I am king, general, judge and jury.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack did his best to seem impressed. ‘It sounds interesting.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot’s face creased into a frown at the mild response. He shook his head again before resolving to carry on. ‘Let me show you the lie of the land.’ He disappeared momentarily from view as he rummaged in the bottom right-hand drawer of his enormous desk. When he re-emerged, he unrolled a creased and well-used map covered with a network of pencilled comments and a web of different-coloured lines and circles.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Here we are.’ He thrust his ink-stained thumb into the dead centre of the unrolled map. ‘Just north of the region we know now as the Bundelkhand Agency, an area ruled by a menagerie of misfits and despots until we finally forced them to cede power to us back in ’02. We now run the place but we allow most of the damn maharajahs to keep their titles so long as they give us free rein and sign their ikrarnama.’ Proudfoot paused as he looked up to check that Jack was paying full attention. He was pleased to see him staring hard at the map, his face creased in concentration.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘We are here in Bhundapur,’ Proudfoot continued, ‘slap bang in the centre of Sawadh. To the north is Oudh, the only other state that is still nominally independent. Over here to the west is Jhansi, the biggest of the local states, with a bitch of a rani called Lakshmibai on the throne. We have at least been able to annex the damn place, and it now falls under the control of the Central India Agency, which also runs the states in the Bundelkhand. The old rajah died without an heir, so we were able to apply Lord Dalhousie’s doctrine, taking the place properly under British rule. It is so much simpler that way, although allowing the rani stay on is a mistake in my opinion. The little strumpet is bound to cause trouble sooner or later. I have written to the Governor, but for the moment that is how things stand. Otherwise I find myself very much in agreement with Dalhousie’s policy. The management of the country will be safer and more efficient if we can reduce the number of these damn feudal states by annexing as many as we can. Do you agree, Danbury?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack was beginning to feel out of his depth. He had learnt a little of the politics of the country during his journey, but there were still wide gaps in his knowledge. He would have to learn fast. ‘I believe we must do what we can to improve the lot of the poorer classes, sir. I would say that is our duty, and if annexation allows us to achieve it, then I believe that is the path we must follow. I understand these maharajahs are a whimsical bunch. Under their rule the people have no protection, and that cannot be a happy state of affairs.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Whimsical!’ Proudfoot found Jack’s choice of word amusing. ‘I have never known a more decadent, lazy, conceited and callow collection of creatures than these maharajahs. We must take them all firmly under our control. We have already been successful by annexing Jhansi, Satara and Nagpur, and I see no reason why we should not do the same here.’ He sat back in his chair. ‘Have you heard much of the Maharajah of Sawadh?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Only a little. I understand that he rules here under your supervision as resident.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well, you are correct on that point.’ Proudfoot smiled in recognition of his own status before his face quickly creased into another scowl. ‘Sawadh became one of our princely states after the fall of the last of the Marathas. The previous Maharajah saw sense and signed his treaty with barely a quibble when he saw what happened to anyone foolish enough to stand against us. The agreement allows his family to continue to rule here, but under my supervision. I won’t bore you with the details, but in short it allows us to make a great deal of money through loans from the Maharajah to our treasury, and by charging for the presence of our forces here.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack did not have to feign his interest. The complicated network of treaties, agencies, annexation and agents was still foreign to him and he was keen to learn more. ‘So it sounds like we have what we want here?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Not at all!’ Proudfoot revealed what he thought of Jack’s naïve observation with a theatrical wave of his hand. ‘We do well enough financially, but we lack full control. Added to that, the Maharajah is a damn pest. Not that I’m granted more than a moment in the great man’s presence. Never more than once a month anyway, and that’s only if he leaves his citadel out in the middle of nowhere and actually deigns to come to Bhundapur. When we do meet, he nods and smiles and says all the right things. Yet he is constantly pushing against my authority, making appointments without my approval, building up the defences at that palace of his or sending his army here, there and yonder without my permission. The damned man is a thorn in my side.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So what are you going to do about it?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘A good question, Danbury.’ For the first time Proudfoot smiled with genuine warmth. ‘I rather think Dalhousie’s doctrine can also be applied here. That will make things,’ he paused before smiling wolfishly, ‘neater.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Does the Maharajah have no heir? I rather thought that was a requirement for us to be able to annex a state upon the death of its ruler.’ Jack was doing his best to show what little he knew of the doctrine named after Lord Dalhousie, the governor general who had first introduced it. He had listened carefully to the conversations of the other officers on the steamship that had brought him to Calcutta. If he recalled correctly, Dalhousie had decreed that when a ruler died without an heir, his state would be annexed and placed under direct British rule. It was a controversial policy that ignored the tradition of childless rulers adopting an heir. But men like Proudfoot and Dalhousie were not ones to let such a trivial matter stand in the way of ensuring the efficient government of the country.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Oh, he claims to have an heir.’ Proudfoot flapped his hand to wave away Jack’s observation. ‘These princes breed like damn rabbits, whelping brats on any of the thousand harlots they have at their command. But I cannot believe for one moment that he is legitimate. The Maharajah knows the rules as well as anyone. He has concocted a cock-and-bull story about his wife dying in childbirth, which is all very tragic I am sure, but that doesn’t mean I have to believe it. He would be a fool not to claim some bastard as his heir and ensure the line of succession. But he did not count on dealing with someone like me. I shall not be fooled!’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack scowled. ‘That would seem a little harsh, sir. What if this boy truly is the Maharajah’s son?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well, what of it! I am not here to mollycoddle some brat just because a damn fool tells me to. It will be neater for us all if the state of Sawadh is annexed. Then it too can fall under the control of the Bundelkhand Agency and this circus can end. The Crown will rule here unfettered, Danbury. It really is better for us all.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So we are intent on the annexation?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Of course.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No matter if we have a legitimate right to do so or not.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I understand, Danbury. I am an Englishman too. But this isn’t some damn game of cricket. We have to leave our sense of fair play back at home.’ Proudfoot looked suitably grave, as if the notion of unsportsmanlike conduct caused him pain. ‘They don’t play by the rules out here and so neither can we. If we turn our backs for an instant then we leave ourselves open to revolt and anarchy. I will not allow that.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I understand, sir.’ Jack did his best to keep his voice level, hiding his true feelings.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Good fellow. It takes a while to become acclimatised to our ways out here on the frontier of the Empire. It is not the simple soldiering you have been used to. It requires a more subtle understanding of the people.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I’m sure it does.’ Jack’s expression was neutral, but there was a trace of scorn in his tone. It was not lost on Proudfoot.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘These things are rarely straightforward, Danbury. It’s something you must learn to accept if you are to prosper here. The locals outnumber us by thousands to our every one. We must be strong in our purpose. If they sense we are weak, then we are doomed. To maintain order, all I have is a company of the 24th, supported by three companies of the 12th Bengal Native Infantry, both stationed here in Bhundapur, and a single squadron of the 1st Bengal Cavalry over at Fort St John, a day’s ride from here. Barely five hundred men when the damn Maharajah has an army at least twenty times the size. Your men are the only British troops for hundreds of miles and I rely on them to be the backbone of my forces. Lieutenant Fenris has been running things in your absence, and I commend him to you. He is a fine officer and I expect you will be gratified to have him.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I look forward to making up my own mind on that count.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot looked up sharply. He opened his mouth as if about to disagree before thinking better of it, contenting himself with a gentle shake of his head at his new subordinate’s belligerence.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Major Dutton commands our contingent from the 12th. He has fashioned them into a fine body of men. Although I expect you’ll wish to make your own mind up about that too.’ Proudfoot sneered, enjoying his own barbed rebuke.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack smiled, unconcerned by the comment. ‘Indeed. I look forward to being able to inspect them.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot puffed his cheeks out. ‘That is not quite what I meant. Look here, Danbury. I am very aware that many Queen’s officers look down on those commissioned by the Company, but I will not tolerate such arrogance here. We are united in our purpose and I will not allow any prejudice to divert us.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You are quite right, sir. I merely meant that I am keenly anticipating having the opportunity to see the 12th in the flesh.’ Jack’s reply was polite, but there was little indication of apology in his expression.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well, I suspect you’ll get that opportunity shortly. I am sure we will all be very gratified to have the opinion of an experienced soldier.’ Proudfoot’s voice was icy. ‘Did you see any action in the Crimea?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘A little.’ A shiver ran down Jack’s spine as he involuntarily recalled the storming of the great redoubt on the slopes overlooking the Alma River. The Russian gunners had mercilessly shredded the redcoats’ ranks, in a desperate bid to turn back the tide of men that marched so steadily towards them. The redcoats had ignored their fearsome casualties, advancing though the dreadful fire to take the redoubt. Jack had been in the front rank of the assault.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Good fellow.’ Proudfoot nodded his approval. ‘We need men of action here. Men who are not frightened of taking the opportunities presented to them. Men like us, Danbury. Men like us.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He had leant forward as he had spoken, his passion obvious. Now he eased back in his chair as if the discussion had been exhausting.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Well, I am very pleased to find we are to have an experienced soldier with us. I sincerely hope we will not have need of your particular skills, but I shall not shrink from a fight if one is forced upon me. Now we must look to get you settled in. I think it will help you if you share a bungalow with Fenris at the start. He has more than enough space. You can form a chummery until you get settled.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot plucked a small silver bell from the corner of his desk, ringing it with a single casual flick of the wrist. The door to the office was whipped open before the gentle sound had quite finished, the official’s khansama marching smartly into the room and snapping to attention.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Show Captain Danbury to Lieutenant Fenris’ bungalow.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The two officers got to their feet and Proudfoot walked quickly around the desk to shake Danbury by the hand, signalling the close of their meeting.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I shall send my steward to collect you for dinner.’ Proudfoot smiled, once more showing real warmth. ‘It is good you are here, Danbury. I have a feeling you will fit in nicely. We have need of men of good breeding and experience.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack returned the smile, the irony of Proudfoot’s words amusing. He might have had as much right to be there as a maharajah’s bastard had to claim a throne, but he was determined to make good his ambition and once again secure the life he craved. He had to, no matter what difficulties he faced. He had nothing else.</p>
