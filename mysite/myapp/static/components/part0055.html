				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">I must start my historical note with an apology. The kingdom of Sawadh did not exist, and the story of Proudfoot and his bloody plans for annexation is nothing more than the product of my imagination. However, I wanted to write about the last days of the East India Company’s rule in India, and so the wonderful Maharajah and his colourful land came into being.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">It now seems preposterous that a commercial company whose sole motivation was the creation of profit should be allowed to govern an entire country. Yet for one hundred years that is what happened in India. Jack arrives as the British East India Company’s great power is at its peak, its unfettered management (some would say mismanagement) of the jewel in the British Crown shortly to come to an end in the ferocious storm of the Indian Mutiny.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">In such an environment, men like Proudfoot thrived. These political officers were entrusted with enormous responsibility and pretty much left alone to run whole countries, some bigger than England itself. With few resources they were expected to govern in Britain’s name, responsible for everything from taxation to the dispensation of justice. It is no wonder that so many became the splendid characters that make the history of the Victorian British Empire so fascinating.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The Doctrine of Lapse, instigated by the Governor General, Lord Dalhousie, in 1848, is all too real, as is the fate of Jhansi, Satara and Nagpur, all of which were annexed under the doctrine. Annexation was also the fate of Oudh in 1856, and many historians have pointed to Dalhousie’s heavy-handed approach to diplomacy as one of the contributory factors that led to the wholesale slaughter of the Indian Mutiny. It is hard to look back on the policies instigated by the East India Company and feel much pride, but as a storyteller I have to be thankful for the events that created such a vibrant world against which to set Jack’s story.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Anyone wanting to learn about the astonishing men of this time would do well to start with <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Shooting Leave</span> by John Ure, or <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Soldier Sahibs</span> by Charles Allen. For more on the lives of the men sent to fight in Britain’s most successful colony, I can heartily recommend the superlative <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Sahib</span>, by Richard Holmes. I am forever in debt to this peerless historian.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">My apology must also extend to the men of the 24th Foot and the 12th Bengal Native Infantry. Both are regiments who served in India at the time; however, I must admit to stealing the four companies away from their historical duties so I could use them in my story.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The 24th would go on to become one of the best known of all British infantry regiments for their disastrous defeat by the Zulus at Isandlwana, followed by the extraordinary efforts of their B Company on 22 January 1879 at Rorke’s Drift. Both events live on, especially in the minds of impressionable young boys like me who sit riveted by the films <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Zulu</span> and <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">Zulu Dawn</span>. It is worth noting that the regiment’s famous ‘Welshness’ is something of a myth. They did not become the South Wales Borderers until 1 July 1881, and so for both the time of my story and that of the fight against the Zulus, they were still very much the 2nd Warwickshires and as English as any other regiment of the time.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The 12th Bengal Native Infantry would also find fame, although for much more sinister reasons. In the dreadful bloodletting of the Indian Mutiny, they would turn against their British masters, and a wing of the regiment was present when the garrison of Jhansi mutinied on 5 June 1857. The subsequent massacre of the fifty-six Christian inhabitants of the city is just another in a long list of atrocities committed by both sides in the brutal fight between the rebels and their British rulers.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack’s time with the British army is now done, for the moment at least, and he faces having to rebuild his life after the cataclysm of battle. Yet he is a survivor and he will march again, no matter how many obstacles appear in his path. He has now enjoyed a meteoric rise to the rank of general, followed by an equally spectacular fall to being nothing more than a humble redcoat. The experience will only serve to galvanise his desire to better himself and to prove just how far an urchin from the rookeries of London can go.</p>
