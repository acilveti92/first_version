The local Arab fishermen prudently stayed ashore; this was not a day to brave the <span class="ref-pnum">treacherous</span> sea. They watched with astonishment as a ramshackle boat <span class="ref-pnum">suddenly</span> emerged from the roaring waves and landed heavily on the wet sand. A few Palestinians, their clothes and <em class="calibre7">keffiyehs</em> rumpled and soaked, jumped out and waded ashore. Their unshaven faces showed the fatigue of a long journey at sea; but they had no time to rest, they were running for their lives. From the angry seas, an Israeli torpedo boat emerged, pursuing them at full speed, carrying soldiers in full battle attire. As it approached the shore, the soldiers jumped into the shallow waters and opened fire on the fleeing Palestinians. A couple of Gazan youngsters, playing on the beach, ran toward the Palestinians and led them to the safety of a nearby orchard; the Israeli soldiers lost track of them but <span class="ref-pnum">continued</span> to search the beach.</p><p id="p19" class="text-indent">Late that night, a young Palestinian man carrying a Kalashnikov <a id="pagebreak-rw_2"></a>snuck into the orchard to investigate. He found the fugitives huddled <span class="ref-pnum">together</span> in a remote corner. “Who are you, brothers?” he asked.</p><p id="p20" class="text-indent">“Members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,” came the answer. “From the Tyre refugee camp, in Lebanon.”</p><p id="p21" class="text-indent">“<em class="calibre7">Marhaba</em>, welcome,” the youth said.</p><p id="p22" class="text-indent">“You know of Abu-Seif, our commander? He sent us to meet with the Popular Front commanders in Beth Lahia (a terrorist stronghold in the south of the Gaza strip). We have money and weapons, and we want to coordinate our operations.”</p><p id="p23" class="text-indent">“I’ll help you with that,” the young man said.</p><p id="p24" class="text-indent">The following morning, several armed terrorists escorted the <span class="ref-pnum">newcomers</span> to an isolated house inside the Jabalia refugee camp. They were led into a large room and invited to sit at a table. Soon after, the Popular Front <span class="ref-pnum">commanders</span> they hoped to meet walked in. They exchanged warm greetings with their Lebanese brothers, and sat, facing them.</p><p id="p25" class="text-indent">“Can we start?” asked a stocky, balding young man wearing a red <em class="calibre7"><span class="ref-pnum">keffiyeh</span></em>, apparently the leader of the Lebanese group. “Is everybody here?”</p><p id="p26" class="text-indent">“Everybody.”</p><p id="p27" class="text-indent">The Lebanese raised his hand and looked at his watch. It was a <span class="ref-pnum">prearranged</span> signal. Suddenly, the “Lebanese envoys” drew their handguns and opened fire. In less than a minute, the Beth Lahia terrorists were dead. The “Lebanese” ran out of the house, made their way through the crooked alleys of the Jabalia camp and Gaza’s crowded streets and soon crossed into Israeli territory. That evening, the man with the red <em class="calibre7">keffiyeh</em>, Captain Meir Dagan, commander of the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) secret Rimon commando unit, reported to General Ariel (Arik) Sharon that Operation Chameleon had been a success. All the leaders of the Popular Front in Beth Lahia, a lethal terrorist group, had been killed.</p><p id="p28" class="text-indent">Dagan was only twenty-six, but already a legendary fighter. He had planned the entire operation: posing as Lebanese terrorists; sailing in an old vessel from Ashdod, a port in Israel; the long night of hiding; the <span class="ref-pnum">meeting</span> with the terrorist leaders; and the escape route after the hit. He had even organized the fake pursuit by the Israeli torpedo boat. Dagan was the <a id="pagebreak-rw_3"></a>ultimate guerrilla, bold and creative, not someone who stuck to the rules of engagement. Yitzhak Rabin once said: “Meir has the unique capacity to invent antiterrorist operations that look like movie thrillers.”</p><p id="p29" class="text-indent">Future Mossad chief Danny Yatom remembered Dagan as a stocky youngster with a mane of brown hair, who had applied to join the most prestigious Israeli commando unit, Sayeret Matkal, and amazed everybody with his knife-throwing skills. With his huge commando knife, he could hit dead-on any target he chose. Although he was an excellent marksman, he failed the Sayeret Matkal tests and initially had to content himself with the silver wings of a paratrooper.</p><p id="p30" class="text-indent">In the early seventies, he was sent to the Gaza strip, which had been conquered by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War and had since become a <span class="ref-pnum">hornet’s</span> nest of deadly terrorist activity. The Palestinian terrorists murdered Israelis daily in the Gaza strip and in Israel with bombs, explosives, and firearms; the IDF had all but lost their control over the violent refugee camps. On January 2, 1971, when the Arroyo children, the five-year-old Avigail and the eight-year-old Mark, were blown to pieces when a terrorist threw a hand grenade into their car, General Ariel (Arik) Sharon decided he had to put an end to the bloody massacre. He recruited a few old friends from his battle-scarred youth, along with several talented younger soldiers. Dagan was one, a round-faced, short, sturdy officer who walked with a limp—he stepped on a land mine in the Six-Day War. While recuperating in the Soroka Hospital in Beer-Sheva, he had fallen in love with his nurse, Bina. They married when he recovered.</p><p id="p31" class="text-indent">Sharon’s unit officially did not exist. Its mission was to destroy the <span class="ref-pnum">terrorist</span> organizations in Gaza using risky and unconventional methods. Dagan used to wander occupied Gaza with a cane, a Doberman, several pistols, revolvers, and submachine guns. Some claimed to have seen him disguised as an Arab, leisurely riding a donkey in the treacherous Gaza alleys. His infirmity didn’t cool his determination to carry out the most dangerous operations. His views were simple. There are enemies, bad Arabs who want to kill us, so we have to kill them first.</p><p id="p32" class="text-indent">Within the unit, Dagan created “Rimon,” the first undercover Israeli <a id="pagebreak-rw_4"></a>commando unit, which operated in Arab disguise deep in enemy <span class="ref-pnum">strongholds</span>. In order to move freely in Arab crowds and reach their targets <span class="ref-pnum">undetected</span>, they had to operate in disguise. They quickly became known as “Arik’s hit team” and rumors had it that they often killed captured <span class="ref-pnum">terrorists</span> in cold blood. Sometimes, it was said, they escorted a terrorist to a dark alley, and told him: “You’ve got two minutes to escape”; when he tried, they shot him dead. Sometimes they would leave behind a dagger or a gun, and when the terrorist reached for it, he would be killed on the spot. <span class="ref-pnum">Journalists</span> wrote that, every morning, Dagan would go out to the fields, use one hand for peeing and the other for shooting at an empty Coke can. Dagan dismissed such reports. “There are myths that stick to all of us,” he said, “but some of what’s written is simply false.”</p><p id="p33" class="text-indent">The tiny unit of Israeli commandos were fighting a tough, cruel war, risking their lives daily. Almost every night Dagan’s people donned <span class="ref-pnum">women’s</span> or fishermen’s disguises and went in search of known terrorists. In mid-January 1971, posing as Arab terrorists in the north of the Strip, they lured Fatah members into an ambush, and in the gunfight that erupted, the Fatah terrorists were killed. On January 29, 1971, this time in uniform, Dagan and his men traveled in two jeeps to the outskirts of the Jabalia camp (a Palestinian refugee camp). Their paths crossed with a taxi, and Dagan recognized, among its passengers, a notorious terrorist, Abu Nimer. He ordered the jeeps to stop and his soldiers surrounded the cab. Dagan <span class="ref-pnum">approached</span>, and at that moment Abu Nimer stepped out, brandishing a hand grenade. Staring at Dagan, he pulled its pin. “Grenade!” Dagan shouted, but instead of scrambling for cover, he jumped on the man, pinned him, and tore the grenade from his hand. For that action he was awarded the Medal of Courage. It’s been claimed that after tossing away the grenade, Dagan killed Abu Nimer with his bare hands.</p><p id="p34" class="text-indent">Years later, in a rare interview with Israeli journalist Ron Leshem, Dagan said: “Rimon wasn’t a hit team … It was not the Wild West, where everybody was trigger-happy. We never harmed women and children … We attacked people who were violent murderers. We hit them and deterred others. To protect civilians, the state needs sometimes to do things that are <a id="pagebreak-rw_5"></a>contrary to democratic behavior. It is true that in units like ours the outer limits can become blurred. That’s why you must be sure that your people are of the best quality. The dirtiest actions should be carried out by the most honest men.</p><div class="blank-line" id="blank-line1"></div><p class="calibre1" id="firstpara3"><span class="dropcap">D</span>emocratic or not—Sharon, Dagan, and their colleagues largely <span class="ref-pnum">annihilated</span> terrorism in Gaza, and for years the area became quiet and peaceful. But some maintain that Sharon half-jokingly said of his loyal aide: “Meir’s specialty is to separate the head of an Arab from his body.”</p><p id="p35" class="text-indent">Yet very few knew the real Dagan. He was born Meir Huberman in 1945 in a train car, on the outskirts of Herson, in the Ukraine, while his family was escaping from Siberia to Poland. Most of his family had perished in the Holocaust. Meir immigrated to Israel with his parents and grew up in a poor neighborhood in Lod, an old Arab town about fifteen miles south of Tel Aviv. Many knew him as an indomitable fighter; few were aware of his secret passions: an avid reader of history books, a vegetarian, he loved classical music and pursued painting and sculpting as hobbies.</p><p id="p36" class="text-indent">He was a man haunted from an early age by the terrible suffering of his family and the Jews during the Holocaust. He dedicated his life to the defense of the newborn State of Israel. As he climbed the army hierarchy, the first thing he did in every new office he was assigned to was to hang on the wall a large photo of an old Jew, wrapped in his prayer shawl, kneeling in front of two SS officers, one holding a bat and the other a gun. “This old man is my grandfather,” Dagan would tell visitors. “I look at the picture, and I know that we must be strong and defend ourselves so that the <span class="ref-pnum">Holocaust</span> never happens again.”</p><p id="p37" class="text-indent">The old man, indeed, was Dagan’s grandfather, Ber Ehrlich Slushni, who was murdered in Lukov a few seconds after the photograph was taken.</p><p id="p38" class="text-indent">During the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, Dagan was among the first <span class="ref-pnum">Israelis</span> to cross the Suez Canal in a reconnaissance unit. In the 1982 Lebanon War, he entered Beirut at the head of his armored brigade. He soon became the commander of the South Lebanon security zone, and there the <span class="ref-pnum">adventurous</span> guerrilla fighter reemerged from the starched colonel’s uniform. <a id="pagebreak-rw_6"></a>He resurrected the principles of secrecy, camouflage, and deception of his Gaza days. His soldiers came up with a new name for their secretive chief. They called him “King of Shadows.” Life in Lebanon, with its secret <span class="ref-pnum">alliances</span>, betrayals, cruelty, phantom wars, was a place after his own heart. “Even before my tank brigade entered Beirut,” he said, “I knew this city well.” And after the Lebanon war ended, he did not give up his secret <span class="ref-pnum">adventures</span>. In 1984 he was officially reprimanded by Chief of Staff Moshe Levy for hanging out, dressed as an Arab, by the Bahamdoun terrorist headquarters.</p><p id="p39" class="text-indent">During the Intifada (the Palestinian rebellion of 1987–1993), when he was transferred to the West Bank as an adviser to Chief of Staff Ehud Barak, Dagan resumed his old habits and even convinced Barak to join him. The two of them donned sweat suits, found a baby-blue Mercedes with local plates, and went for a ride in the treacherous Nablus Kasbah. On their <span class="ref-pnum">return</span>, they scared and then astonished the Military Headquarters sentries, once the latter recognized who was sitting in the front seat.</p><p id="p40" class="text-indent">In 1995, Dagan, now a major general, left the army and joined his buddy Yossi Ben-Hanan on an eighteen-month motorcycle journey across the Asian plains. Their trip was cut short by the news of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination. Back in Israel, Dagan spent some time at the head of the <span class="ref-pnum">antiterrorist</span> authority, made a halfhearted attempt to join the business world, and helped Sharon in his Likud electoral campaign. Then, in 2002, he <span class="ref-pnum">retired</span> to his country home in Galilee, to his books, his records, his palette, and his sculptor’s chisel.</p><p id="p41" class="text-indent">Thirty years after Gaza, a retired general, he was now getting acquainted with his family—“I suddenly woke up and my kids were grown-ups already”—when he got a phone call from his old buddy, now prime <span class="ref-pnum">minister</span>, Arik Sharon. “I want you at the head of Mossad,” Sharon said to his fifty-seven-year-old friend. “I need a Mossad chief with a dagger between his teeth.”</p><p id="p42" class="text-indent">It was 2002 and Mossad was losing steam. Several failures in the <span class="ref-pnum">preceding</span> years had dealt severe blows to its prestige; the much-publicized failure to assassinate a major Hamas leader in Amman and the capture of <a id="pagebreak-rw_7"></a>Israeli agents in Switzerland, Cyprus, and New Zealand had seriously <span class="ref-pnum">damaged</span> Mossad’s reputation. The last head of Mossad, Efraim Halevy, didn’t live up to expectations. A former ambassador to the European Union in Brussels, he was a good diplomat and a good analyst, but not a leader and not a fighter. Sharon wanted to have at the head of Mossad a bold, creative leader who would be a formidable weapon against Islamic terrorism and the Iranian reactor.</p><p id="p43" class="text-indent">Dagan was not welcomed at Mossad. An outsider, focused mostly on operations, he didn’t care very much about learned intelligence analyses or secret diplomatic exchanges. Several top Mossad officers resigned in protest, but Dagan didn’t much care. He rebuilt the operational units, <span class="ref-pnum">established</span> close working relations with foreign secret services, and busied himself with the Iranian threat. When the second, disastrous Lebanon War erupted in 2006, he was the only Israeli leader who objected to the strategy based on massive bombardments by the air force. He believed in a land <span class="ref-pnum">offensive</span>, doubted the air force could win the war, and came out of the war unblemished.</p><p id="p44" class="text-indent">Still, he was much criticized by the press for his tough attitude toward his subordinates. Frustrated retired Mossad officers, ran to the media with their gripes, and Dagan was under constant fire. “Dagan Who?” scribbled one popular columnist.</p><p id="p45" class="text-indent">And then, one day, the headlines changed. Flattering articles loaded with superlatives filled the daily papers, lauding “the man who restored honor to Mossad.”</p><p id="p46" class="text-indent">Under Dagan’s control, Mossad had accomplished the heretofore <span class="ref-pnum">unimaginable</span>: the assassination of Hezbollah’s mad killer Imad Mughniyeh in Damascus, the destruction of the Syrian nuclear reactor, the liquidation of key terrorist leaders in Lebanon and Syria, and, most remarkable of all, a relentless, ruthless, and successful campaign against Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program.</p></div>
