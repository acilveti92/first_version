				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The Russian infantry stirred into life and the drummers at the centre of each column settled into the hypnotic rhythm of the march.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Here they come,’ Dodds announced.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, Dodds.’ Jack was glad of the chance to speak and break the foreboding silence that had gripped his company. ‘Aim low, men. Hit the bastards in the guts. Make them hurt.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The officers of the westernmost Russian column, seeing what lay ahead, aligned their attack so that it would swamp the redcoats who bravely but foolishly contested its passage.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The second column, further to the east, bore to the left of the redcoats’ flank, ignoring their futile resistance, seeking an easier route to the Alma. It would keep them away from the fight, leaving the redcoats to concentrate their fire on the western column.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack prowled up and down the section of the line where the remnants of the Light Company waited for the enemy, offering his few words of advice and encouragement. His feet scuffed against discarded equipment, the detritus of the Light Division’s attack littering the ground. Mercifully, the bodies of the dead and wounded had been dragged to one side so at least he was spared having to walk over their torn flesh. The captain of the guards had moved to the left flank of the line, leaving Jack to command the right. The unspoken agreement to share the command left Jack absurdly pleased with himself.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There were less than sixty redcoats in the line, facing more than ten times their number in the Russian column. In the centre of the line the colours of the Scots Fusiliers barely stirred in the light breeze. The two colours added a touch of grandeur that seemed out of place in a scene of such appalling human devastation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘When they come, stick them with your spikes.’ Jack was still patrolling the line. ‘Make those bastards bleed.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To the right, Jack saw Digby-Brown draw his sword. The bright afternoon sunlight flashed from its blade. The lieutenant looked dreadfully young, flecks of dried blood standing out like engorged freckles against his pale face. He offered a tight-lipped smile when he saw his captain looking at him, his young eyes reflecting a world-weary sadness more suited to someone much older than his tender age.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack would have liked to go to his lieutenant’s side, to offer a word of comfort or to show a shred of compassion. But the advancing Russian column made that impossible. All Jack could do was return Digby-Brown’s brave smile with a nod of encouragement.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At one hundred yards, volley fire!’ The guards captain’s voice was firm, every syllable enunciated with care, as if the officer was aware these could be the last orders he was ever going to give.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Present!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The line of rifles steadied as the men braced themselves to fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fire!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The volley crashed out, spitting sixty Minié balls into the packed ranks of the Russian column. Many in the front rank crumpled, as did some behind them as the powerful bullets ripped through living flesh and on into succeeding ranks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Reload!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The guards captain called out the orders calmly, as if conducting a company drill rather than a desperate final defence that would likely see his whole command destroyed within minutes. The men obeyed without conscious thought. To Jack’s shame he realised that he had not taken the time to find out the captain’s name. He would fight this last battle under the command of a stranger.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Present.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">More than one redcoat fumbled his ammunition or dropped his firing caps, exhaustion and haste making his fingers clumsy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fire!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A second volley exploded across the slope, following by the crackle of tardy shots form the men who had not been ready.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The front of the column had been butchered. Dozens of Russian soldiers had been struck down, their bodies blocking the way of the men behind them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Charge! Charge!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">This was the time for the exhausted and bedraggled redcoats to unleash their terror on the stalled enemy. A ragged cheer erupted from their parched throats and they surged forward, sixty men emerging from the cloud of powder smoke to charge six hundred like the very hounds of hell.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack drew his sword as he ran, the long steel edge rasping from the scabbard, its balanced weight snug in his hand. The blade felt alive, as if a vital force of energy was flowing into him, filling his aching muscles with a new strength. With his sword held high in his right hand, he tugged Peacock’s revolver free from its holster with his left.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The redcoats closed on the Russian ranks, their wild screams freezing the blood of the enemy conscripts. The Russian officers yelled orders, the air full of their foreign words and unintelligible commands. The column jerked into motion once more. The leading ranks hefted their own bayonets and braced themselves for the impact of the charge. Their movements were ponderous, the Russian conscripts clearly terrified of the screaming redcoats.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The redcoats closed the distance quickly and hammered into the leading Russian ranks. The first Russian conscripts died in an instant, wholly unable to deflect the violent assault. The leading redcoats pulled their bayonets out of the flesh of their first victims and moved on to the next, pounding forward, stepping over their victims, stabbing and gutting without pause.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack went with his men, his whole body thrilling to the insanity of the charge. There was a wild joy in the madness that he savoured even as the terror and the fear cascaded through his soul. Nothing mattered except the desire to smash his sword into the enemy, to fight and hack at anyone who dared to stand in his way. It was irresistible.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A gap appeared between Dodds and Taylor, the two redcoats fighting directly in front of Jack. He pushed into the opening, thrusting his sword forward eagerly. Its razor-sharp point pierced the flesh of a Russian soldier who had been about to stab an unsuspecting Fusilier Dodds in the side. The Russian’s head whipped round with a scream as Jack’s blade slid between two of his ribs. Despite the agony of the wound the Russian twisted his hands on the musket so he could bring it round to stab his attacker. The bayonet snagged on the corner of Dodds’s jacket, which gave Jack an opening. He raised his left hand and jammed the barrel of his revolver into the face of the wounded Russian.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Without hesitation, Jack pulled the trigger.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian jerked backwards as if an invisible rope had tugged him. The bullet punched his body free of Jack’s sword and sent him flailing into the soldiers behind him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack steadied his wrist, changed his point of aim and fired again, repeating the action until all five chambers were empty. The storm of bullets struck home with appalling violence and cleared a space between him and the nearest Russians. Without a second thought, he stepped forward, relishing the opportunity to flay his sword at the enemy, heedless of the risk. As he moved, he threw the now empty revolver into the face of a Russian conscript and swung his blade wildly. To his frustration the sword sliced into the wood of a Russian musket. Jack’s arm rang with the impact but he recovered quickly and swept the blade forward once more. This time the tip took the throat of the Russian whose musket had blocked the first wild attack.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The enemy were all around him, his mindless attack had driven him deep into the Russian ranks. Bayonets thrust at him from every angle and it took all his speed to bring his sword round in a desperate, sweeping defence. One bayonet slipped past his blade and tore into the hem of his jacket where it stuck fast. The horrified look in its owner’s eyes barely registered in Jack’s mind before he swept his sword across the Russian’s face, taking the man’s sight in a heartbeat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s men pressed forward and were soon fighting close around him once more.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The redcoats had thrust hard and fast into the Russian ranks but the column was deep and the wedge of redcoats converged into an ever finer point. At its tip, Jack and the men of the Light Company fought like men possessed, dozens of Russian conscripts dying under their dreadful assault. Yet redcoats, too, were falling. Steadily their numbers dwindled and the assault slowly ground to a halt against the sheer number of enemy soldiers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russians moved round the point of the attack, forcing the British soldiers on the flanks to give ground, bending the attacking line back on itself. It was only a matter of time before the redcoats were surrounded.</p>
