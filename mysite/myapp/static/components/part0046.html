				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Lieutenant Moore hit the square like a knight of old. The huge officer was mounted on the biggest charger in the battalion and he thundered into the Persian infantry’s re-forming ranks, using his horse as a living battering ram to force an opening. Men were knocked flying as the huge animal smashed through their files, their bodies broken by the force of the impact. Moore slashed at those left standing, cutting a bloody swathe through the Persian flank.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As soon as he had broken through the shattered ranks, he reined his horse round hard, turning into the wall of bayonets that stood on his flank. He battered his sword down as he turned, the heavy blade a vicious weapon in the hands of such a powerful man.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack rode into the melee. He cut down a man from behind, mercilessly slashing his talwar against the back of the man’s undefended head. He pushed his horse into the gap, cutting at another Persian infantryman, who stood in mute horror as he saw his comrades dying at the hands of the British officers. He caught the man in the neck, slicing his blade deep into the man’s flesh, killing him before he could fight back.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Moore fought like a man possessed, his blade never still as he thrust at the men around him. With dreadful skill he hammered his way through the Persian ranks, walking his horse over the bodies of the men he had killed, pressing forward, clearing a path that he lined with bloodied corpses.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack realised what his lieutenant was trying to do, and he forced his own horse to follow, battering away the bayonets that reached up to stab at him. His horse staggered as it stepped on a corpse but rallied quickly, steadying its footing just in time to allow Jack to thrust the point of his talwar into a man’s face moments before the Persian had been about to drive a bayonet into the animal’s breast.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He urged his mount on, joining Moore in his attempt to reach his fallen brother. Together they forced a path through the files, kicking out or thrashing their sabres at anyone who tried to block their path. The Persian infantrymen began to step back, terrified of the two bloody warriors who fought with such intensity.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They reached the younger Moore’s fallen horse and Jack rode past the trapped officer, forcing the closest enemy soldiers away. One man risked an attack, coming at him from his left-hand side. Jack saw the blade and slashed his sabre round, but he was tiring, his reactions dulled by the constant struggle to stay alive, and the bayonet slipped past his parry and drove deep into his horse’s chest. The animal staggered and the Persian soldier shrieked in triumph, but it was a short-lived moment of joy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack kicked his feet free of the stirrups the moment he felt his horse stagger and vaulted clear, landing on the balls of his feet as his mount toppled to one side. He hammered the hilt of his sword forward, smashing it into the enemy soldier’s face and bludgeoning him to the ground. He felt the rage course through him and punched the sword down, driving the tip deep into the fallen man’s heart.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The solidity of the ground beneath his feet came as a relief. This was this type of fighting he knew best, and he threw himself at the closest enemy. The bayonet-tipped muskets lunged forward, but he had seen it all before and it was easy to let them come, swaying out of their way before counterattacking, slashing his own blade forward and cutting down the men who were trying to kill him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The closest men backed away and Jack snatched his revolver out of its holster. In one practised move he swung it up and aimed at the press of bodies to his front. There was just time to register the horror on the dark faces before he opened fire. At such short range, the revolver was brutally effective, and each shot knocked a man to the ground.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The rest of the Bombay Lights hit the square. Their officers had rushed ahead, using the speed of their superior horses to take the fight to the Persians. Now the troopers poured through the square’s broken face, riding over the bodies of the dead and the dying. A handful of Persians still stood in the shredded ranks, and they fought hard, striking men from the saddle or stabbing at the horses that raced past them. But there were too many gaps and the line collapsed as the Bombay Lights cut their way in.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The rest of the square did not stand a chance. The British cavalry attacked without pause, the pace of the charge barely checked by the men they rode down. They smashed into the backs of the other flanks, cutting down the men in swathes, their bloody sabres working furiously. Without pause they rode back and forth, striking man after man from their feet. The centre of the square became a charnel house, the ground churned into a bloody quagmire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With his revolver empty, Jack turned and ran to the side of the younger Moore, who still lay trapped under his fallen horse. The Persian troops were trying to run, but the British horsemen were everywhere, spurring mercilessly over any man who tried to flee, their faces twisted into dreadful masks of hate as they went about the bloody task with brutal efficiency.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Moore slashed his broken sabre upwards as he sensed Jack approaching. ‘For fuck’s sake, it’s Fenris,’ Jack bellowed as he was forced to dodge back sharply. The adjutant’s weapon had snapped midway up the blade, but the blood that was smeared on what remained showed that he had still used the weapon to effect.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack saw the flare of recognition on Moore’s face, and he bent forward and heaved at the body of the dead horse that had the younger officer trapped. The animal was smothered in blood and his hands slipped as they tried to get a grip on the slick, matted coat. He lowered his shoulder and pressed it hard against the animal’s flank. He grunted with the effort but managed to move the beast a fraction. It was enough for Moore to scramble free. The lower half of his uniform was sodden with blood, but he appeared to be largely intact.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His brother left the slaughter and came towards them, his huge horse lathered in sweat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’re a damn fool!’ The older Moore’s face was twisted with anger, and for a moment Jack thought he would strike his brother down.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The younger sibling threw his head back and bellowed with the sheer joy of being alive, then stepped forward and slapped his brother hard on the thigh. ‘You always were a soulless bastard.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned away. He walked across to the body of his dead horse, feeling the remorse of having led the brave beast to its death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Are you coming?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned to face the two brothers. The adjutant had slipped a foot into his brother’s stirrup and taken a firm hold on the back of the saddle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook his head.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thanks for your help, old man.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack waved the brothers away. His attention was focused on two figures who were trying to flee unnoticed amidst the rout of the Persian army’s centre. The men wore a strange uniform, one wholly different from that sported by the rest of the Persian army. A uniform that had no right to be there.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had recognised it at once. He had fought against men with similar dark blue coats and spiked helmets. Then he had been a red-coated officer, leading his troops against the enemy’s prepared position on the far bank of the Alma river. Now he saw two men wearing the same uniform and he broke into a run, forcing his tired body to move, chasing after the officers dressed in the uniform of the Russian Empire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He forgot the broken square and the staggering victory the Bombay Lights had earned. Ballard had taught him well, and Jack knew that the men trying to escape the blood and carnage of the battlefield held the answer to the riddle of the Persian spy.</p>
