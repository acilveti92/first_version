			<p class="bt-1st-para3">My friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, while possessed of one of the most vigorous minds of our generation, and while capable of displaying tremendous feats of physical activity when the situation required it, could nevertheless remain in his armchair perfectly motionless longer than any other human being I have ever encountered. This skill passed wholly unrecognized by its owner. I do not believe he held any intentions to impress me so, nor do I think the exercise was, for him, a strenuous one. Still, I maintain the belief that when a man has held the same pose for a period exceeding three hours, and when that man is undoubtedly awake, that same man has accomplished an unnatural feat.</p>
			<p class="bt">I turned away from my task of organizing a set of old journals that lead-grey afternoon to observe Holmes yet perched with one leg curled beneath him, firelight burnishing the edges of his dressing gown as he sat with his head in his hand, a long-abandoned book laid upon the carpet. The familiar sight had grown increasingly unnerving as the hours progressed. It was with a view to ascertain that my friend was still alive that I went so far against my habits as to interrupt his reverie.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear chap, would you care to take a turn with me? I’ve an errand with the boot-maker down the road, and the weather has cleared somewhat.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I do not know if it was the still-ominous dark canopy that deterred him or his own pensive mood, but Holmes merely replied, “I require better distraction just now than an errand which is not my own and the capricious designs of a March rainstorm.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What precise variety of distraction would be more to your liking?” I inquired, a trifle nettled at his dismissal.</p>
			<p class="bt">He waved a slender hand, at last lifting his dark head from the upholstery where it had reclined for so long. “Nothing you can provide me. It is the old story—for these two days I have received not a shred of worthwhile correspondence, nor has any poor soul abused our front doorbell with an eye to engage my services. The world is weary, I am weary, and I grow weary with being weary of it. Thus, Watson, as you see I am entirely useless myself at the moment, my state cannot be bettered through frivolous occupations.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I suppose I would be pleased no one is so disturbed in mind as to seek your aid, if I did not know what your work meant to you,” I said with greater sympathy.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Well, well, there is no use lamenting over it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, but I should certainly help if I could.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What could you possibly do?” he sniffed. “I hope you are not about to tell me your pocket watch has been stolen, or your great-aunt disappeared without trace.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am safe on those counts, thank you. But perhaps I can yet offer you a problem to vex your brain for half an hour.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A problem? Oh, I’m terribly sorry—I had forgotten. If you want to know where the other key to the desk has wandered off to, I was given cause recently to test the pliancy of such objects. I’ll have a new one made—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I had not noticed the key,” I interrupted him with a smile, “but I could, if you like, relate a series of events which once befell me when I was in practice in San Francisco, the curious details of which have perplexed me for years. My work on these old diaries reminded me of them, and the circumstances were quite in your line.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I suppose I should be grateful you are at least not staring daggers at my undocketed case files,” he remarked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You see? There are myriad advantages. It would be preferable to venturing out, for it is already raining again. And should you refuse, I will be every bit as unoccupied as you, which I would also prefer to avoid.” I did not mention that if he remained a statue an instant longer, the sheer eeriness of the room would force me out of doors.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are to tell me a tale of your frontier days, and I am to solve it?” he asked blandly, but the subtle angle of one eyebrow told me he was intrigued.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, if you can.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“What if you haven’t the data?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Then we shall proceed directly to the brandy and cigars.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s a formidable challenge.” To my great relief, he lifted himself in the air by his hands and crossed his legs underneath him, reaching after he had done so for the pipe lying cold on the side table. “I cannot say I’ve any confidence it can be done, but as an experiment presented to the specialist, it has a certain flair.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“In that case, I shall tell you the story, and you may pose any questions that occur to you.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Take care that you begin at the beginning, Watson,” he admonished me sternly, settling himself into a comfortable air of resigned attention. “And provide me with as many details as you can summon up.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is quite fresh in my mind again, for I’d set it down in the volumes I was just mulling over. As you know, my residence in America was relatively brief, but San Francisco lives in my memory quite as vividly as Sydney or Bombay—an impetuous, thriving town nestled among the great hills, where the fogs are spun from ocean air and the pale amber light refracts from Montgomery Street’s countless glass windows. It is as if all the men and women of enterprise across the globe determined they should have a city of their own, for the Gold Rush built it and the Silver Lode built it again, and now that they have been linked by railroad with the Eastern states, the populace believes quite rightly that nothing is impossible. One sees quite as many nations and trades represented as in London, all jostling each other into a thousand bizarre coincidences, and you would not be surprised to find a Chinese apothecary wedged between a French milliner and an Italian wine merchant.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My practice was based on Front Street in a small brick building, near a number of druggist establishments, and I readily received any patients who happened my way. Poor or well-off, genteel or ruffianly, it made no difference to a boy in the first flush of his career. I’d no long-established references, and for that reason no great clientele, but it was impossible to feel small in that city, for they so prized hard work and optimism that I anticipated sudden successes lay every moment round the next corner.</p>
			<p class="bt">“One hazy afternoon, as I’d no appointments and I could see the sun lighting up the masts of the ships in the Bay, I decided I’d sat idle long enough, and set out for a bit of exercise. It is one of San Francisco’s peculiar characteristics that no matter in what direction one wanders, one must encounter a steep hill, for there are seven of them, and within half an hour of walking aimlessly away from the water, I found myself striding up Nob Hill, staring in awe at the array of houses.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Houses,’ in fact, is rather a misnomer; they call it Nob Hill because it is populated by mining and railroad nabobs, and the residences are like something from the reign of Ludwig the Second or Marie Antoinette. Many are larger than our landed estates, but all were built within ten years of the time I arrived. I ambled past a Gothic near-castle and a Neo-Classic mansion only to spy an Italianate villa across the street, each making an effort to best all the others in stained glass, columns, and turrets. The neighborhood—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Was a wealthy one.” Holmes sighed, hopping out of his chair to pour two glasses of claret.</p>
			<p class="bt">“And you would doubtless have found that section of town appalling.” As he handed me a wineglass, I smiled at the thought of my Bohemian friend eyeing those pleasure domes with cool distaste. “There would have been others more to your liking, I think. Nevertheless, the villa was a marvel of architecture, and as I neared the crest of the hill, I stopped to take in the view of the Pacific.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Standing there watching the sun glow orange over the waves, I heard a door fly open, and turned to see an old man hobbling frantically down a manicured path leading to the street. The mansion he’d exited was built more discreetly than most, vaguely Grecian and painted white. He was very tall—quite as tall as you, my dear fellow—but with shoulders like an ox. He was dressed in a decades-old military uniform, with a tattered blue coat over his grey trousers, and a broad red tie and cloth belt, his silvery hair standing out from his head as if he’d just stepped from the thick of battle.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Although he cut an extraordinary figure, I would not have paid him much mind in that mad metropolis had not a young lady rushed after him in pursuit, crying out, ‘Uncle! Stop, please! You mustn’t go, I beg of you!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“The man she’d addressed as her uncle gained the curb not ten feet from where I stood and then all at once collapsed onto the pavement, his chest no longer heaving and the leg which had limped crumpled underneath him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I rushed to his side. He breathed, but shallowly. From my closer vantage point, I could see that one of his limbs was false, and that it had come loose from its leather straps, causing his fall. The girl reached us not ten seconds later, gasping for breath even as she made a valiant effort to prevent her eyes from tearing.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Is he all right?’ she asked me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I think so,’ I replied, ‘but I prefer to be certain. I am a doctor, and would be happy to examine him more carefully indoors.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I cannot tell you how grateful we would be. Jefferson!’ she called to a tall black servant hurrying down the path. ‘Please help us get the colonel inside.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Between the three of us, we quickly established my patient on the sofa in a cheerful, glass-walled morning room, and I was able to make a more thorough diagnosis. Apart from the carefully crafted wooden leg, which I reattached more securely, he seemed in perfect health, and if he were not such a large and apparently hale man I should have imagined that he had merely fainted.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘<span class="charoverride5">Has he hurt himself, Doctor?’ the young lady asked breathlessly.</span></p>
			<p class="bt">“Despite her evident distress, I saw at once she was a beautiful woman, with a small-framed figure and yet a large measure of that grace which goes with greater stature. Her hair was light auburn, swept away from her creamy complexion in loose waves and wound in an elegant knot, and her eyes shone golden brown through her remaining tears. She wore a pale blue dress trimmed with silver, and her ungloved hand clutched at the folds in her apprehension. She—my dear fellow, are you all right?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Perfectly,” Holmes replied with another cough which, had I been in an uncharitable humor, I would have thought resembled a chuckle. “Do go on.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘This man will be quite all right once he has rested,’ I told her. ‘My name is John Watson.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Forgive me—I am Molly Warburton, and the man you’ve been tending is my uncle, Colonel Patrick Warburton. Oh, what a fright I have had! I cannot thank you enough.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Miss Warburton, I wonder if I might speak with you in another room, so as not to disturb your uncle while he recovers.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“She led me across the hall into another tastefully appointed parlor, this one decorated with paintings of desert landscapes I thought must have depicted the American South, and fell exhaustedly into a chair. I hesitated to disturb her further, and yet I felt compelled to make my anxieties known.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Miss Warburton, I do not think your uncle would have collapsed in such a dramatic manner had he not been under serious mental strain. Has anything occurred recently which might have upset him?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Dr. Watson, you have stumbled upon a family embarrassment,’ she said softly. ‘My uncle’s mental state has been precarious for some time now, and I fear recently he—he has taken a great turn for the worse.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I am sorry to hear it.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘The story takes some little time in telling, but I will ring for tea, and you will know all about it. First of all, Dr. Watson, I live here with my brother Charles and my uncle the colonel. Apart from Uncle Patrick, Charles and I have no living relatives, and we are very grateful to him for his generosity. Uncle made a great fortune in shipping during the early days of California statehood. My brother is making his start in the photography business, and I am unmarried, so living with the colonel is for the moment a very comfortable situation.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘You must know that my uncle was a firebrand in his youth, and saw a great deal of war as a settler in Texas, before that region was counted among the United States. The pitched fighting between the Texians—that is, the Anglo settlers—and the Tejanos so moved him that he joined the Texas Army under Sam Houston, and was decorated several times for his valor on the field, notably at the Battle of San Jacinto. Later, when the War Between the States began, he was a commander for the Union, and lost his leg during the Siege of Petersburg. Forgive me if I bore you.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Not at all.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘From your voice, I do not think you are a natural-born American,’ she added with a smile.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Your story greatly interests me. Is that his old Texas uniform he wore today?’ I asked.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Yes, it is,’ she replied as a flicker of pain distorted her pretty face. ‘He has been costuming himself like that with greater and greater frequency. The affliction—for I do not know what else to call it—began several weeks ago. Indeed, I believe the first symptom took place when he changed his will.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘How so? Was it a material alteration?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Charlie and I had been the sole beneficiaries,’ she replied, gripping a handkerchief tightly. ‘But now, his entire fortune will be distributed amongst various war charities. Texas War for Independence charities, Civil War charities. He is obsessed with war,’ she choked, and then hid her face in her hands.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I was already moved by her story, Holmes, but the oddity of the colonel’s condition intrigued me still further.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘What are his other symptoms?’ I queried when she had recovered herself.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘After he changed his will, he began seeing the most terrible visions in the dark. Dr. Watson, he claims in truly passionate language that he is haunted. He swears he saw a fearsome Tejano with a pistol and a whip threatening a white woman, and on another occasion he witnessed the same apparition using a bayonet to slaughter one of Houston’s men. That is what so upset him, for only this morning he insisted he saw a murderous band of ghosts brandishing swords and torches, with the identical Tejano at their head. My brother believes that we have a duty as his family to remain and care for him, but I confess Uncle frightens me at times. If we abandoned him, he would have no one save his old manservant. Sam Jefferson served the colonel for many years—as far back as Texas, I believe—and when my uncle built this house, Jefferson became the head butler.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“She was interrupted in her narrative as the door opened and the man I knew at once to be her brother stepped in. He had the same light brown eyes as she, and fine features, which twisted into a question at the sight of me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Hello, Molly. Who is this gentleman?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Charlie, it was horrible,’ she cried, running to him. ‘Uncle Patrick tore out of the house and collapsed. This is Dr. John Watson. He has been so helpful and sympathetic that I was telling him all about Uncle’s condition.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Charles Warburton shook my hand readily. ‘Very sorry to have troubled you, Doctor, but as you can see, we are in something of a mess. If Uncle Patrick grows any worse, I hate to think what—’</p>
			<p class="bt">“Just then a great roar echoed from the morning room, followed by a shattering crash. The three of us rushed into the hallway and found Colonel Warburton staring wildly about him, a vase broken into shards at his feet.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I left this house once,’ he swore, ‘and by the devil I will do it again. It’s full of vengeful spirits, and I will see you all in Hell for keeping me here!’</p>
			<p class="bt">“The niece and nephew did their utmost to calm the colonel, but he grew even more enraged at the sight of them. In fact, he was so violently agitated that only Sam Jefferson could coax him, with my help, toward his bedroom, and once we had reached it, the colonel slammed the door shut in the faces of his kinfolk.</p>
			<p class="bt">“By sheer good fortune, after some cajoling I persuaded him to take a sedative, and when he fell back in a daze on his bed, I stood up and looked about me. His room was quite Spartan, with hardly anything on the white walls, in a simple style I supposed was a relic of his days in Texas. I have told you that the remainder of the house also reflected his disdain for frippery. The wall-facing bed rested under a pleasant open window, and as it was on the ground floor, one could look directly out at the gardens after turning about and blinking oneself awake.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I had turned to rejoin my hosts when Sam Jefferson cleared his throat behind me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘You believe he’ll be all right, sir?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“He spoke with the slow, deep tones of a man born on the other side of the Mississippi. I had not noticed it before, but a thick knot of scarring ran across his dark temple, which led me to believe he had done quite as much fighting in his youth as his employer—or worse, been somehow brutalized during the period before the harrowing conflict which ripped the nation asunder to end the slave trade.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I hope he will recover from his present attack quite soon, but his family would do well to consult a specialist,’ I replied. ‘He is on the brink of a nervous collapse. Was the colonel so fanciful in his younger days?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I don’t rightly know about ‘fanciful,’ sir. He’s as superstitious a man as ever I knew, and more afeared of spirits than most. Always has been. But sir, I got a mind to tell you something else about these spells the colonel been having.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Yes?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Only this, Doctor,’ and his low voice sank to a whisper. ‘That first time as he had a vision, I set it down for a dream. Mister Patrick’s always been more keen on the bogeymen than I have, sir, and I paid it no mind. But after the second bad spell—the one where he saw the Tejano stabbing the soldier—he went and showed me something that he didn’t show the others.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘What was it?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“He walked over to where the colonel now slept and pointed at a gash in the old uniform’s breast, where the garment had been carefully mended.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘The day Mister Patrick told me about that dream was the same day I mended this here hole in his shirt. Thought himself crazy, he did, and I can’t say as I blame him. Because this hole is in exactly the spot where he dreamed the Tejano stabbed the Texian the night before. What do you think of that, sir?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I’ve no idea what to think of it,’ I replied. ‘It is most peculiar, but surely it must prove to be a coincidence.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Then there’s this third vision,’ he went on patiently. ‘The one he had last night. Says he saw a band of ’em with torches, marching toward him like a pack of demons. I don’t know about that. But I sure know that yesterday morning, when I went to start the fire in the library, half our kindling was missing. Clean gone, sir. Didn’t make much of it at the time, but this puts it in another light.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Sherlock Holmes, who had changed postures a gratifying number of times during my account, rubbed his long hands together avidly before clapping them.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s splendid, my dear fellow. Positively first-class. The room was very bare indeed, you say?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes. Even in the midst of wealth, he lived like a soldier.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t suppose you can tell me what you saw outside the window?”</p>
			<p class="bt">I hesitated, reflecting as best I could.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Though I wish I could furnish you with a clue of some sort, there was nothing outside the window, for I made certain to look. Jefferson assured me that he examined the grounds near the house after he discovered that the firewood was missing and found no sign of unusual traffic. When I asked after an odd hole, he mentioned that a tall lilac had been torn out from under the window weeks previous because it blocked the sunshine, but that cannot have had any bearing. As I said, the bed faced the wall, not the window.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Holmes tilted his head back with a light laugh. “Yes, you did say that, and I assure you I am coming to a greater appreciation of your skills as an investigator. What happened next?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I quit the house soon afterward. The younger Warburtons were anxious to know what had transpired in the sickroom, and I comforted them, saying that their uncle was asleep, and unlikely to suffer another such outburst that day. Then I assured them all, including Jefferson, that I would return the following afternoon to check on my patient.</p>
			<p class="bt">“As I departed, I could not help noticing another man walking up the side path leading to the back door. He was very bronzed, with a long handlebar moustache and unkempt black hair, and he was dressed in simple trousers and a colorful but roughly woven linen shirt of the kind that the Mexican laborers wore. This swarthy fellow paid me no mind, but walked straight ahead, and I seized the opportunity to memorize his looks in case he should come to have any bearing on the matter. I did not know what to make of the colonel’s ghostly affliction, or Jefferson’s bizarre account of its two physical manifestations, but I thought it an odd enough coincidence to note.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The next day, I saw a patient or two in the afternoon and then locked my practice, this time hailing a hack to take me up Nob Hill. Jefferson greeted me at the door and led me into a study of sorts, its tall shelves stacked with gold-lettered military volumes and historical works. Colonel Warburton stood there dressed quite normally, in a grey summer suit, and he seemed bewildered by his own behavior the day before.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘It’s a bona fide curse, I can’t help but think, and I’m suffering to end it,’ he said to me. ‘There are times I know I’m not in my right senses, and other times when I can see those wretched visions before me as clear as your face is now.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Is there anything else you can tell me which might help in my diagnosis?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Not that won’t make me out to be cracked in the head, Dr. Watson. After every one of these living nightmares, I’ve awakened with the same pain in my head, and I can’t for the life of me decide whether I’ve imagined the whole thing or if I really am haunted by one of the men I killed during the war in Texas. I can’t pretend as I’d be a lick surprised to learn I’d done someone a terrible wrong back then. Affairs were that muddled, and the lands under such bitter dispute, and for such surefire reasons on both sides, you understand—I’ve no doubt I came out on one or more of the wrong Tejanos, men who were only thinking to protect what was and always had been theirs. So much bloodshed in those days, no man has the luxury of knowing he was always in the right.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘It does indeed sound as if the past preoccupies your thoughts excessively. I am no expert in disorders of the mind,’ I warned him, ‘although I will do all I can for you. You ought to consult a specialist if your symptoms persist or worsen. May I have your permission, however, to ask a seemingly unrelated question?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘By all means.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Have you in your employ, or do any of your servants or gardeners occasionally hire, Mexican workers?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“He seemed quite puzzled by the question. ‘I don’t happen to have any Hispanos on my payroll. And when the staff need day labor, they almost always engage Chinese. They’re quick and honest, and they come cheap. Why do you ask?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“I convinced him that my question had been purely clinical, congratulated him on his recovery, and made my way to the foyer, mulling several new ideas over in my brain. Jefferson appeared to see me out, handing me my hat and stick.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Where are the other members of the household today?’ I inquired.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Miss Molly is out paying calls, and Mister Charles is working in his darkroom.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘Jefferson, I saw a rather mysterious fellow yesterday as I was leaving. To your knowledge, are any men of Mexican or Chileno descent ever hired by the groundskeeper?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“I would swear to you, Holmes, that a strange glow lit his eyes when I posed that question, but he merely shook his head. ‘Anyone does any hiring, Dr. Watson, I know all about it. And no one of that type been asking after work here for six months and more.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I was merely curious whether the sight of such a man had upset the colonel,’ I explained, ‘but as you know, he is much better today. I am no closer to tracing the source of his affliction, but I hope that if anything new occurs, or if you are ever in doubt, you will contact me.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘These spells, they come and they go, Dr. Watson,’ Jefferson replied, ‘but if I discover aught, I’ll surely let you know of it.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“When I quit the house, I set myself a brisk pace, for I thought to walk down the hill as evening fell. But just as I began my descent, and the wind picked up from the west, I saw not twenty yards ahead of me the same sun-burnished laborer I’d spied the day before, attired in the same fashion, and clearly having emerged from some part of the Warburton residence moments previous. The very sight of him roused my blood; I had not yet met you, of course, and thus knew nothing whatever of detective work, but some instinct told me to follow him to determine whether or not the colonel was the victim of a malignant design.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You followed him?” Holmes interjected with a startled expression. “Whatever for?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I felt I had no choice—the parallels between his presence and Colonel Warburton’s nightmares had to be explained.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ever the man of action.” My friend shook his head. “Where did he lead you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“When he reached Broadway, where the land flattened and the mansions gave way to grocers, butcheries, and cigar shops, he stopped to mount a streetcar. By a lucky chance, there was a passing hack, which I hailed, and I ordered the driver to follow the streetcar until I called for him to stop.</p>
			<p class="bt">“My quarry went nearly as far as the waterfront before he descended, and in a trice I paid my driver and set off in pursuit toward the base of Telegraph Hill. During the Gold Rush days, the ocean-facing slope had been a tent colony of chilenos and peruanos. That settlement intermixed with the lowest hell of them all on its eastern flank: Sydney-Town, where the escaped Australian convicts and ticket-of-leave men ran the vilest public houses imaginable. It is a matter of historical record that the Fierce Grizzly employed a live bear chained outside its door.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I have heard of that district,” Holmes declared keenly. “The whole of it is known as the Barbary Coast, is it not? I confess I should have liked to see it in its prime, although there are any number of streets in London I can visit should I wish to take my life in my hands. You did not yourself encounter any wild beasts?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Not in the strictest sense; but inside of ten minutes, I found myself passing gin palaces that could have rivaled St. Giles for depravity. The gaslights appeared sickly and meager, and riotous men stumbled from one red-curtained den of thieves to the next, either losing their money willingly by gambling it away, or drinking from the wrong glass only to find themselves propped insensate in an alley the next morning without a cent to their name.</p>
			<p class="bt">“At one point I thought I had lost sight of him, for a drayman’s cart came between us and at the same moment he ducked into one of the deadfalls. I soon ascertained where he had gone, however, and after a moment’s hesitation entered the place myself.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dull light shone from cheap tallow candles and ancient kerosene lamps with dark purple shades. Losing no time, I approached the man and asked if I could speak with him.</p>
			<p class="bt">“He stared at me silently, his dark eyes narrowed into slits. At last, he signaled the barman for a second drink and handed me a small glass of clear liquor.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I thanked him, but he remained dumb. ‘Do you speak English?’ I inquired finally.</p>
			<p class="bt">“He grinned, and with an easy motion of his wrist flicked back his drink and set the empty glass on the bar. ‘I speak it as well as you, <span class="charoverride3">señor.</span> My name is Juan Portillo. What do you want?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I want to know why you visited the Warburton residence yesterday and again this afternoon.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“His smile broadened even further. ‘Ah, now I understand. You follow me?’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘There have been suspicious events at that house, ones which I have reason to believe may concern you.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I know nothing of suspicious events. They hire me to do a job, and to be quiet. So I am quiet.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I must warn you that if you attempt to harm the colonel in any way, you will answer for it to me.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“He nodded at me coldly, still smiling. ‘Finish your drink, <span class="charoverride3">señor.</span> And then I will show you something.’</p>
			<p class="bt">“I had seen the saloon keeper pour my liquor from the same bottle as his, and thus could not object to drinking it. The stuff was as strong as gin, but warmer, and left a fiery burn in the throat. I had barely finished it when Portillo drew out of some hidden sheath a very long, mother-of-pearl-handled knife.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘I never harm the colonel. I never even see this colonel. But I tell you something anyway. Men who follow me, they answer to this,’ he said, lifting the knife.</p>
			<p class="bt">“He snarled something in Spanish. Three men, who had been sitting at a round table several yards away, stood up and strode toward us. Two carried pistols in their belts, and one tapped a short, stout cudgel in his hand. I was evaluating whether to make do with the bowie knife I kept on my person, or cut my losses and attempt an escape, when one of the men stopped short.</p>
			<p class="bt">“ ‘<span class="charoverride3">Es el Doctor!</span> Dr. Watson, yes?’ he said eagerly.</p>
			<p class="bt">“After a moment’s astonishment, I recognized a patient I had treated not two weeks before even though he could not pay me, a man who had gashed his leg so badly in a fight on the wharf, his friends had carried him to the nearest physician. He was profoundly happy to see me, a torrent of Spanish flowing from his lips, and before two minutes had passed of him gesturing proudly at his wound and pointing at me, Portillo’s dispute had been forgotten. I did not press my luck, but joined them for another glass of that wretched substance and bade them farewell, Portillo’s unblinking black eyes upon me until I was out of the bar and making for Front Street with all speed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The next day I determined to report Portillo’s presence to the colonel, for as little as I understood, I now believed him an even more sinister character than I’d first suspected. To my dismay, however, I found the house in a terrible uproar.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I am not surprised. What had happened?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Sam Jefferson stood accused of breaking into Charles Warburton’s darkroom with the intent to steal his photographic apparatus. The servant who opened the door to me was hardly lucid for her tears, and I heard cruel vituperations even from outside the house. Apparently, or so the downstairs maid said in her state of near-hysterics, Charles had already sacked Jefferson, but the colonel was livid his nephew had acted without his approval, theft or no theft, and at the very moment I arrived they were locked in a violent quarrel. From where I stood, I could hear Colonel Warburton screaming that Jefferson be recalled, and Charles shouting back that he had already suffered enough indignities in that house to last him a lifetime. Come now, Holmes, admit to me that the tale is entirely unique,” I could not help but add, for the flush of color in my friend’s face told me precisely how deeply he was interested.</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is not the ideal word,” he demurred, sipping his wine. “I have not yet heard all, but there were cases in Lisbon and Salzburg within the last fifty years which may possibly have some bearing. Please, finish your story. You left, of course, for what gentleman could remain in such circumstances, and you called the next day upon the colonel.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I did not, as a matter of fact, call upon the colonel.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No? Your natural curiosity did not get the better of you?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“When I arrived the following morning, Colonel Warburton as well as Sam Jefferson had vanished into thin air.”</p>
			<p class="bt">I expected this revelation to strike like a bolt from the firmament, but was destined for disappointment.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Ha,” Holmes said with the trace of a smile. “Had they indeed?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Molly and Charles Warburton were beside themselves with worry. The safe had been opened and many deeds and securities, not to mention paper currency, were missing. There was no sign of force, so they theorized that their uncle had been compelled or persuaded to provide the combination.</p>
			<p class="bt">“A search party set out at once, of course, and descriptions of Warburton and Jefferson were circulated, but to no avail. The mad colonel and his servant, either together or separately, voluntarily or against their wills, quit the city without leaving a single clue behind them. Upon my evidence the police brought Portillo in for questioning, but he provided a conclusive alibi and could not be charged. And so Colonel Warburton’s obsession with war, as well as the inscrutable designs of his manservant, remain to this day unexplained.</p>
			<p class="bt">“What do you think of it?” I finished triumphantly, for Holmes by this time had leaned forward in his chair, entirely engrossed.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I think that Sam Jefferson—apart from you and your noble intentions, my dear fellow—was quite the hero of this tale.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How can you mean?” I asked, puzzled. “Surely the darkroom incident casts him in an extremely suspicious light. All we know is that he disappeared, probably with the colonel, and the rumor in San Francisco told that they were both stolen away by the Tejano ghost who possessed the house. That is rubbish, of course, but even now I cannot think where they went, or why.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is impossible to know where they vanished,” Holmes replied, his grey eyes sparkling, “but I can certainly tell you why.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Dear God, you have solved it?” I exclaimed in delight. “You cannot be in earnest—I’ve racked my brain over it for all these years to no avail. What the devil happened?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“First of all, Watson, I fear I must relieve you of a misapprehension. I believe Molly and Charles Warburton were the authors of a nefarious and subtle plot which, if not for your intervention and Sam Jefferson’s, might well have succeeded.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“How could you know that?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Because you have told me, my dear fellow, and a very workmanlike job you did in posting me up. Ask yourself when the colonel’s mental illness began. What was his initial symptom?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“He changed his will.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It is, you must own, a very telling starting point. So telling, in fact, that we must pay it the most stringent attention.” Holmes jumped to his feet and commenced pacing the carpet like a mathematician expounding over a theorem. “Now, there are very few steps—criminal or otherwise—one can take when one is disinherited. Forgery is a viable option, and the most common. Murder is out, unless your victim has yet to sign his intentions into effect. The Warburtons hit upon a scheme as cunning as it is rare: they undertook to prove a sane man mad.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“But Holmes, that can scarcely be possible.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I admit that fortune was undoubtedly in their favor. The colonel already suffered from an irrational preoccupation with the supernatural. Additionally, his bedroom lacked any sort of ornament, and young Charles Warburton specialized in photographic technique.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear Holmes, you know I’ve the utmost respect for your remarkable faculty, but I cannot fathom a word of what you just said,” I confessed.</p>
			<p class="bt">He laughed. “I shall do better, then. Have we any reason to think Jefferson lied when he told you of the ghost’s earthly manifestations?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“No, but nevertheless he could have meant anything by it. He could have slit that hole and stolen that firewood himself.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Granted. But it was after you told him of Portillo’s presence that he broke into the photography studio.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You see a connection between Portillo and Charles Warburton’s photographs?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Decidedly so, as well as a connection between the photographs, the blank wall, and the torn-out lilac bush.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Holmes, that doesn’t even—”</p>
			<p class="bt">I stopped myself as an idea dawned on me. Finally, after the passage of many years, I was beginning to understand.</p>
			<p class="bt">“You are talking about a magic lantern,” I said slowly. “By God, I have been so blind.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“You were remarkably astute, my boy, for you took note of every essential detail. As a matter of fact, I believe you can take it from here,” he added with more than his usual grace.</p>
			<p class="bt">“The colonel disinherited his niece and nephew, possibly because he abhorred their mercenary natures, in favor of war charities,” I stated hesitantly. “In a stroke of brilliance, they decided to make it seem war was his mania; they would not allow him to so slight his kin. Charles hired Juan Portillo to appear in a series of photographs as a Tejano soldier and promised that he would be paid handsomely if he kept the sessions secret. The nephew developed the images onto glass slides and projected them through a magic lantern device outside the window in the dead of night. His victim was so terrified by the apparition on his wall, he never thought to look for its source behind him. The first picture, threatening the white woman, likely featured Molly Warburton. But for the second plate . . . ”</p>
			<p class="bt">“That of the knife plunging into the Texian’s chest, they borrowed the colonel’s old garb and probably placed it on a dummy. The firewood ‘disappeared’ so that a number of men could assemble, farther off on the grounds, to portray rebels with torches. The lilac, as is obvious—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Stood in the way of the magic lantern apparatus!” I cried. “What could be simpler?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And the headaches the colonel experienced afterward?” my friend prodded me.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Likely an aftereffect of an opiate or narcotic his family added to his meal in order to heighten the experience of the visions in his bedchamber.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And Sam Jefferson?”</p>
			<p class="bt">“A deeply underestimated opponent who saw the Warburtons for what they were and kept a constant watch. The only thing he stole was a look at the plates in Charles’s studio as his final piece of evidence. When they sent him packing, he told the colonel all he knew and they—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Were never heard from again,” Holmes finished with a poetic flourish.</p>
			<p class="bt">“In fact, they found the perfect revenge.” I laughed to think of it. “Colonel Warburton had no interest in his own wealth and took more than enough to live from the safe. And after all, when he was finally declared dead, his estate was distributed just as he wished it.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Yes, a number of lucky events occurred. I am grateful, as I confess I have been at other times, that you are an utterly decent fellow, my dear Doctor.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I don’t understand,” I said in some confusion.</p>
			<p class="bt">“I see the world in terms of cause and effect. If you had not been the sort of man willing to treat a rogue wounded in a knife fight who had no means of paying you, it is possible you would not have had the opportunity to tell me this story.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It wasn’t so simple as all that,” I muttered, rather abashed, “but thank—”</p>
			<p class="bt">“And an admirable story it was, too. You know, Watson,” Holmes continued, extinguishing his pipe, “from all I have heard of America, it must be an exceedingly fertile ground for men of mettle. The place lives almost mythically in the estimations of most Englishmen. I myself have scarcely met an American, ethically inclined or otherwise, who did not possess a certain audacity of mind.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“It’s the pioneer in them, I suppose. Still, I cannot help thinking that you are more than a match for anyone, American or otherwise.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“I would not presume to contradict you, but that vast expanse boasts more than its share of crime as well as of imagination, and for that reason commands some respect. I am not a complete stranger to the American criminal.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“My dear fellow, I should be delighted to hear you expound on that subject,” I exclaimed, glancing longingly at my notebook and pen.</p>
			<p class="bt">“Another time, perhaps.” My friend paused, his long fingers drumming along with the drops as he stared through our front window, eyes glittering brighter than the rain-soaked street below. “Perhaps one day we may both find occasion to test ourselves further on their soil. I should like to have met this Sam Jefferson, for instance. He had a decided talent.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“Talent or no, he was there to witness the events; you solved them based on a secondhand account by a man who’d never so much as heard of the science of deduction at that time.”</p>
			<p class="bt">“There are precious few crimes in this world, merely a hundred million variations upon a dozen or so themes. I have thought of categorizing them into a monograph at some point, to aid assiduous officers of the law in identifying what type of mischief they are facing. Some of these inspectors wouldn’t know a Spanish Prisoner scheme from an involuntary manslaughter, I fear.”</p>
			<p class="bt">Laughing, I remarked, “To think I imagined it might confound you—how very callow of me.”</p>
			<p class="bt">He shrugged. “It was a fetching little problem, however, no matter it was not matchless. The use of the magic lantern, although I will never prove it, I believe to have been absolutely inspired. Now,” he proclaimed, striding to his violin and picking it up, “if you would be so kind as to locate the brandy and cigars you mentioned earlier, I will show my appreciation by entertaining you in turn. You’ve come round to my liking for Kreutzer, I think? Capital. I must thank you for bringing your very interesting case to my attention; I shall lose no time informing my brother I solved it without moving a muscle. And thus, my dear Watson, we shall continue our efforts to enliven a dreary afternoon.”</p>
