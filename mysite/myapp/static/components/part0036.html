				<p class="ht-half-title"/>
				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">A roundshot struck the very centre of McCulloch’s company, decapitating one fusilier and taking the arm from another. Jack tore his gaze from the awful sight and tried to stand as still as possible. Despite his best efforts, he could not help flinching at every deadly projectile that rushed by. One came so close to his head that he felt the powerful rush of air as it flew past.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His terror was like a caged beast that prowled and fought for escape from deep inside him. Time crawled by, every second seeming like a minute, every minute like an hour. The barrage tossed and churned the ground around the company, the dark soil like spilt blood across the bright green grass. It was enough to drive a man to madness. Yet the redcoats endured the trial. They lay in their ranks and held their terror at bay, waiting for the order to move.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">To Jack’s horror a roundshot struck one of his men. In front of his sickened eyes, it smashed down straight into Fusilier Trotter, ripping his arm from his body and sending a fountain of bright red blood into the air. Trotter screamed, a single, shrill cry that rang loudly in the ears of his fellow redcoats before he fell mercifully silent.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘On your feet!’ Jack echoed the order he heard shouted somewhere to his right. ‘Lively now!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers pulled themselves to their feet, relieved to be moving yet terrified to be advancing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fix bayonets!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">This was it, the final preparation before the men closed with the enemy. The fusiliers pulled their long bayonets from their belts, locking them into place on their already loaded rifles. The officers drew their swords and pulled revolvers from their pouches. The bugles sounded the advance and the long red line jerked into motion, leaving their dead behind them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The fusiliers marched towards the river where the 95th were already engaging the enemy. The far riverbank was crowded with Russian skirmishers who sniped at the advancing red line. Puffs of smoke erupted from the barrels of the Greenjackets’ rifles as the British skirmishers returned fire. They moved in extended order, fighting in pairs, like grasshoppers performing an intricate dance. One man from each pair dropped to one knee to fire at the Russian sharpshooters while the other moved forward, covering his partner until he was loaded and ready to move. Officers and sergeants choreographed the movement with shouts and whistles, ensuring their men fought with ruthless efficiency.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack watched the Greenjackets at work, impressed by their skill. The line of redcoats marched steadily forward, forcing the riflemen to move quickly to screen the progress of the battalions. Jack was convinced his company would have performed as well, his fusiliers at least the equal of the grasshoppers. The thought that, had he had his way, he would already be in action sent an icy wave of fear flushing through his veins. He had never expected to be so terrified.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He led his men forward into the shattered remains of a vineyard. Long lines of vines lay twisted underfoot, decades of careful tending and growth trampled under the careless boots of the advancing redcoats. A handful of vines survived and the fusiliers snatched bunches of ripe grapes as they passed by, gorging on the juicy fruit even as they marched into the storm of fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A fusilier from the left flank of McCulloch’s company fell to the Russian fire, his face a mask of blood that spilled over the grapes still in his mouth. He toppled silently to the ground, his death ignored by the men either side of him. The closest sergeant ordered the ranks to close up. There was no time for compassion, sympathy or grief. The advance could not falter.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Rifle bullets fluttered through the vineyard, flicking the branches and buzzing past the ears of the fusiliers, as if the crop was under attack from a plague of deadly insects. The Russian fire was heavy; it was worse, far worse, than Jack could ever have imagined. It seemed inevitable that all the redcoats must surely be struck down. Yet by some miracle only a man here and there fell to the enemy fire. The redcoats continued to advance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Then Jack was shot.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A solid object thumped hard against his body, a stab of pain flaring in the very centre of his chest. His free hand clutched at the pain, his shaking fingers feeling for the tattered flesh that would reveal a horrific wound.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His fingers closed over a solid lump that rested against his ribs. With a shaking hand, Jack pulled the musket ball from where it had lodged in his jacket. Fired at long range the bullet had not had the force to pierce his flesh, its power already spent. Apart from a neat hole in his coat, it had done no damage.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Shaking with a heady mix of fear and relief, Jack hurled the musket ball away. If the Russians had been armed with Minié rifles, Jack knew he would now be dead. It was a sobering thought and he silently offered his grateful thanks to a beneficent God that had denied the majority of the Russian army modern weaponry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian infantry on the slopes to the south of the Alma were wasting their powder; their ancient muskets lacked the power to inflict much damage at such a distance. Fusiliers gasped and swore as the spent bullets struck them, the stinging blow was painful but it did little except shred the men’s uniforms and their already strained nerves. But the Russian skirmishers were armed with modern rifles. They were starting to exact a high toll on the line that snaked towards the Alma. Sergeant Shepherd fell, his shoulder smashed and two more fusiliers from the Light Company went down under the withering fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British wounded were abandoned to their fate. Some picked themselves up, bravely rushing forward to catch up with their company, cursing at the pain, staunching their wounds as best they could. Others walked, crawled or pulled themselves to the rear, desperate to get out of the line of fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The continual order to close the ranks was all that marked the passing of the fallen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Come on!’ Jack roared, urging his men forward. He sensed the pace of the advance begin to falter. The men were still moving forward but the steady, rhythmic pace of the march was gone. The long red chain was breaking up. The men were moving towards the river in small groups or on their own, their instinct to find cover becoming ever more powerful as more of their mates fell to the enemy fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Leave him!’ Two fusiliers had paused to help one of their mates who had taken a bullet in the thigh, the blood pulsing over the fingers he clasped desperately to the gaping hole in his leg. ‘Come on! Move!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Move, you sluggards! Get moving!’ Digby-Brown, too, was driving the men forward, physically pushing any fusilier who hesitated. The young lieutenant mimicked his captain, grabbing any who stopped to help a wounded man and sought to use the charitable act as an excuse to stop advancing into the merciless fire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Step by faltering step the redcoats edged to the far side of the vineyard. The bank of the Alma River was now just a few short yards ahead.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">At the edge of the vineyard, the fusiliers staggered to a halt. They stared in fear at the open ground that led down the gentle slope to the riverbank. The dozen yards taunted them, daring them to leave the meagre sanctuary of the shattered vineyard. The enemy fire seemed to redouble as they stood there, refusing to advance despite the roars of the officers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack screamed at his men to advance, thumping his fists against the backs of the terrified fusiliers. He could see their fear in their faces, and the flashes of anger as he tried to drive them into the horrific fire that flensed the open ground in front of them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fusiliers!’ Jack’s voice was huge. ‘Advance, damn you! Move! Move!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But the fear of the enemy fire was too strong. The British advance had stopped.</p>
