				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The Light Company drilled alone. Since early that morning, they, along with the rest of the battalion, had been toiling in fatigue parties. The army was desperately trying to bring order out of the chaos of the landings that were still proceeding through a second day. When the battalion’s services were finally dispensed with, Jack had asked his colonel to give him leave to march his company a short distance from the battalion lines in an attempt to try to inject some much-needed vigour into the lacklustre fusiliers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Colonel James Morris cherished his battalion. He fussed over it like an over-proud parent and he had been delighted that his new Light Company commander showed such enthusiasm. With the colonel’s blessing, and despite the sullen protests of the exhausted company, Jack had marched his fusiliers half a mile inland, seeking space away from the prying and critical eyes of the battalion. They were by no means the most forward British troops and neither Jack nor the colonel had been concerned that the Light Company would be marching into any danger – complacency that Jack would soon bitterly regret.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Captain Sloames, sir. Cossacks!’ Lieutenant Thomas could barely contain his excitement as he spotted the enemy troops on the crest of a ridge a thousand yards from where the Light Company was being drilled.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men of the company stopped in mid-evolution, looking up to stare with fascination as the Russian irregular cavalry fanned out, forming line along the ridge. Stories of Cossack ferocity had been the talk of the army for months, their reputation as hard, vicious fighters growing with each retelling. Now the Light Company was privileged to be some of the first British troops to see their foe in the flesh.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank you, Mr Thomas. A little less excitement, if you please,’ Jack said with as much sangfroid as his racing heart would allow. ‘I’m sure they are just here to watch how well we can perform our drill and I’m equally sure they are as unimpressed as I am.’ Jack turned to face his company. ‘No one told you to stop. You look like frightened serving girls caught with their hands down the master’s trousers. Now, stand to attention and shoulder arms! Let us at least try to look like fusiliers. Sergeants, dress the ranks!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Light Company brought their rifles to their shoulders at the command while the three sergeants hurried down the line, pushing at a man here, pulling at another there, to make sure the line was dressed and ordered. Jack strode ahead of the line and as he walked he opened the leather case that held his field glasses at his hip. Captain Sloames had never scrimped on his equipment and the field glasses were new; they still smelt of their protective oil. They were manufactured by Dollond of London, the best that Sloames could afford, and the heavy brass they were made of felt lumpy and cold in Jack’s hands as he extended the lenses.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack took a deep breath as he focused on the Russian cavalry, both to settle his nerves and to steady his hands. He panned slowly down their line. The Light Company was being observed by half a Cossack <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">sotnya</span>,<span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic"> </span>around fifty irregular cavalry armed with fearsome ten and a half foot long lances that rested on a leather strap attached to the right foot. The light glistened off the iron tips of the alarming weapons, and Jack’s shoulder blades twitched involuntarily as his imagination dwelt on the deadly purpose of the wickedly sharp blades.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Cossacks sat high in their saddles, feet above the belly of their horses which snorted and pawed at the tussocks of grass beneath their hooves. The men’s dress was loose and baggy, with a wide variety of different jackets. On their heads most wore a fur shako, often with a double pom-pom hanging to one side. The rest wore a motley array of differing headgear that served to enhance their foreign appearance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">In addition to the terrible lances, Jack could see a sabre hanging at the side of every man and a mixture of muskets, carbines and pistols strapped to their horses’ saddles. The Cossacks were well armed and looking for trouble. It was dawning on Jack that his small command might just be the sort of target the Cossacks had been waiting for.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Digby-Brown walked forward to join his captain. ‘They look a shabby crew. Are they truly Cossacks?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I believe so.’ Jack kept his field glasses trained on the enemy cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Digby-Brown was trying his best to adjust to his commander’s curt and dismissive manner, even though it never failed to nettle him. It was obvious that in their short acquaintance his new captain had taken a dislike to him. Digby-Brown could not think with what justification Sloames had formed his poor opinion but he was certain the best way to proceed was to ignore the barbed remarks and prove his worth to his company commander.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There’s about fifty of them, I would say, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack ignored him, continuing to pan his field glasses slowly along the line of enemy cavalry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, definitely fifty.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s mouth twitched in annoyance as his subaltern confirmed the obvious. ‘Are you of the opinion that I need assistance observing the enemy?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, sir, of course not.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And do you think that I managed to make it all the way to the rank of captain without possessing the ability to count?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No, sir! I was trying—’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Be quiet,’ Jack cut across him. ‘I can assure you, Lieutenant, that I am quite capable of counting the number of enemy troops without your damn interference.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack went back to studying the Cossacks, his thoughts in turmoil. By keeping the glasses pressed to his face, he could avoid giving any orders. Right now, that was a good thing, as he had no idea what he should do next. He felt the gaze of his men burning into the back of his scarlet coat as they watched and waited for his command. It was as if their expectation was a physical presence leaning down on him, its weight pressing on his shoulders.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">As he watched, the Cossacks started to move. Unlike the fusiliers, they moved fluidly and with confidence. Jack could not make out who was commanding the enemy troops. If there were any officers present then they were dressed in the same drab garb as their men, unlike their British counterparts who stood out against their troops like peacocks in a chicken coop. The left half of the Russian cavalry moved forward and down the slope, crossing obliquely in front of the right-hand troops and forming a new rank to its front. It was a calm demonstration of proficiency that was utterly chilling.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack finally pulled his field glasses away from his face, the purposeful deployment of the enemy forcing him to act. His last glimpse of the Cossacks showed them to be lifting the foot of their lances from the leather stirrup that held it in place as they rode, positioning it under their right armpits and readying it for use.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned to face his men, forcing himself to turn his back on the threat of fifty deadly lances. His throat felt constricted and dry so that he was forced to clear it noisily, despite knowing that it would make him appear nervous in front of the men.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Company! Prepare to load!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men stiffened, their bodies tensing as they readied themselves to load their newly issued Minié rifles.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Like any rifle, the inside of the barrel was grooved. When fired, the conically shaped minié bullet deformed at the base, allowing it to engage the rifling whilst sealing in the power of the exploding charge. The spinning ball was said to be accurate to six hundred yards, but the soldiers maintained it would penetrate a soldier at double that distance, pass through his knapsack and still have enough force to strike down men in the ranks behind.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The process of loading the rifle took around thirty seconds. Slower than the veterans of Waterloo could load their Brown Bess muskets, but the reduced rate of fire was more than made up for by the rifle’s vastly increased range, better accuracy, and the hitting power of the Minié balls themselves. A volley from a battalion armed with Minié rifles would devastate any opponent in a battle of musketry.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Company! Load!’ Jack bellowed the command and the men reacted immediately. In a sequence of movements they had practised until it had become second nature, the men of the Light Company loaded their rifles. Their rifle butts hit the wet soil as one, each the regulation six inches in front of the soldier’s body. The weapon was held in the left hand while the right hand deftly extracted a cartridge from the ammunition bag. The top of the cartridge was bitten off and the powder poured down the rifle’s barrel, swiftly followed by the Minié ball.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Their hands and arms moving in unison, the fusiliers whipped the ramrod out of the loops that held it suspended underneath the barrel and used it to ram the bullet down on to the powder. As soon as they had rammed it home, giving it two final taps to make sure it was resting on the powder, the ramrod was withdrawn and returned to its loops. The rifle’s butt was brought up from the ground to rest against the soldier’s right hip while a fresh percussion cap from the cap box on the front of his belt was fitted to the firelock.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The two ranks of Cossack horsemen stood ominously still. The Light Company finished loading, the fusiliers now as primed for a fight as their weapons. The company was formed into two ranks with the three sergeants and two lieutenants making a third line three paces behind the second rank.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack ordered the men to fix bayonets and then, with as calm a demeanour as he could muster, walked to his station on the right of the line. His men were in a precarious position. Sixty-three fusiliers, three sergeants and three officers were not much of a force but it had to be at least the equal of fifty mounted Cossacks. But Jack was not confident.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Twice he cleared his throat to order the men to withdraw and twice the order died on his lips. Trying to withdraw in an orderly fashion whilst being harried by the best light cavalry in the Russian army would be a desperate affair. Jack could sense the men’s growing unease. They were starting to fidget. He knew they needed firm leadership to steady them. He tried to imagine what any of his former captains would have done. What the real Captain Sloames might have said to calm the men’s anxiety. The responsibility of command was more daunting than he could ever have imagined. His right hand gripped and re-gripped the hilt of his sword, his indecision infuriating and frightening in equal measure. He sensed the first man in the rear rank make a shuffling movement backwards. The tiny movement rippled through the ranks as if the men were gently stirring in the light breeze that blew inshore from the coast.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The movement shamed him into action. If the men took it into their heads to run, they were all doomed. The Cossacks would pounce on them as soon as the tight formation broke up. On their own, the men would be slaughtered. He could not let that happen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He strode forward to stand in front of the company, the heels of his boots hitting the ground with such force that each step sent an explosion of water out of the ground.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stand fast!’ Jack demanded of his command, his eyes roving over the two ranks. ‘You are British fusiliers. Where is your goddamn pride?’ He raised his voice, challenging his men, hiding his lack of experience under a covering of anger.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The few fusiliers who had been stalwart enough to meet his gaze dropped their eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We stand together and we face the enemy. We don’t show fear. We don’t show panic. We stand in silence and let them know they are facing the finest soldiers on this whole damn earth!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack turned to observe the enemy. His show of anger might have disguised his indecision but it did nothing to stop the Cossacks. They began to advance before his eyes, the line of horsemen moving forward as one.</p>
