				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Ballard! You scrawny rogue, welcome.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good morning, sir, I’m pleased to be here.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Then you are a damn fool. No one wants to be in a shithole like this. It is a festering cesspit. A godforsaken turd of a place that the bloody Persians are welcome to keep.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘If you say so, sir.’ Ballard did his best to smile at the ribald remarks.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Major General Foster Stalker twitched the thick moustache that dominated his face, clearly displeased with the mild response. The garrulous officer sat behind a folding field desk in a large bell tent, one of no more than a dozen that had been brought ashore. His temporary headquarters was a hive of activity. Staff officers bustled in and out, brandishing reports and scraps of paper as if they held the key to the entire campaign in their hands. Most were being filtered through an officer wearing the star and crown of a captain on his collar who sat at a separate desk near the tent’s entrance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Hunter!’ Stalker bellowed across the tent to get his aide-de-camp’s attention. ‘Come over here, you damn scoundrel, and listen to what the Devil here has to say.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, sir.’ Captain Hunter got to his feet. It was clear he was used to his general’s domineering manner. He smiled pleasantly as he came across to join the pair of intelligence officers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack had watched Ballard closely as Stalker delivered his forthright opinion on the local area. A casual observer would have noticed nothing on the major’s face that betrayed his reaction, but Jack saw the slightest narrowing of the eyes as Ballard winced at Stalker’s coarse tongue. He was becoming accustomed to the major’s ways, and he knew Ballard would not enjoy such a vulgar display, even from his own commanding officer.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Gentlemen, may I introduce Captain Fenris. He will be working for me.’ Ballard hid his distaste well and introduced Jack to the pair of officers with urbane charm. They had discussed at great length what name he should take, and had decided to stick with Fenris rather than assume yet another false identity. It was unlikely that anyone else would make the connection between a hussar captain and a young lieutenant who had died in an unknown battle in the far north-east of the country. Moreover, Jack had already been introduced to some of the officers in Stalker’s division as Fenris, and it would be harder to explain a change of name than a change of uniform.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Knightly was serving with the 64th,<span> </span>which now formed a part of Stalker’s division. Jack had a mind to look him out as soon as possible, as much to check that the young officer was surviving the rigours of his job as to reveal his own new rank and position.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What’s he here for?’ Stalker barked the question, already turning his attention to a piece of paper lying on his desk.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He will assist me in my duties, sir, with a particular remit to ensure the security of our intelligence.’ Ballard was careful in his reply.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sounds bloody dull.’ Stalker scrunched up the paper and threw it to the floor. He fixed Jack with an uncompromising stare. ‘If you want to do some real damn soldiering, let Hunter know.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am sure Captain Fenris will be actively employed in the intelligence department, sir.’ Ballard answered the general quickly, giving Jack no time to reply.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t see how.’ Stalker’s bushy eyebrows knitted together. ‘You already have that brute of a man with you. What’s his name?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Palmer, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And now you need someone else! God alone knows what you all bloody do all day.’ Stalker shook his head. ‘So, what do I face?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I have a full report for you, sir,’ Ballard replied. He was clearly trying hard to avoid becoming nettled by his general, keeping his replies brisk and businesslike.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I am sure you have. Hunter can read that later. I want a summary and I want it now.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The slightest flush of crimson decorated Ballard’s prominent cheekbones at the rebuke. To his credit, he rallied quickly. ‘Very well, sir. We now know that the Shah’s forces took Herat on the twenty-fifth of October. He has added the city to the twelve other foreign provinces under Persian imperial control. The closest enemy forces are still at the fort at Reshire, sir, as in my last report. Current estimate has them numbering around two thousand infantry. The Shah also maintains a strong garrison at the port of Bushire, twelve miles from here, but the bulk of his army is still inland. He will know of our arrival and initial reports claim that he is beginning to assemble his strength around the town of Borãzjoon, forty-six miles from here. It is this force that we will have to face in battle, and I would say that we should expect them to be ready to dispute our presence here shortly.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So you say there are two thousand in this fart of a fort.’ Stalker sat back in his chair as he considered Ballard’s assessment. ‘Well, we have no choice in the matter. My orders are to strike inland and bring the Persians to battle. I am to destroy their forces and take and hold as much territory as I can until that dolt of a Shah sees sense and asks for terms. Before I can think of moving inland, I need to secure a strong base of operations, and that includes seizing the port at Bushire. Before I can launch an attack there, I need a secure foothold here so that I may assemble the division, and that means I have to take this bloody turd of a fort. Things are never simple.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That is why we need generals of your quality, sir,’ Ballard replied smoothly. ‘If it were easy, then anyone could do it.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack tried not to smile at his commander’s false charm. It was clearly wasted on Stalker, who nodded as if Ballard had offered him wise advice, but Jack noticed Captain Hunter’s mouth twitch. Clearly the general’s aide-de-camp was not cut from the same cloth as his master.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That is the first sensible bloody thing you have said.’ Stalker puffed out his cheeks as he accepted the praise. ‘Now then, any changes in their defences?’ He fired the question back. For the first time, Ballard had his fullest attention.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Nothing new, sir. The remains of the old Dutch fort continue to be strengthened, but we have not seen any new trenches since our last inspection.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Ha!’ Stalker laughed in a single syllable. He fixed Jack with a glare. ‘Did the Devil here tell you about that?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook his head before speaking for the first time. ‘No, sir.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It still astonishes me. Ballard here visited Reshire a few weeks ago at the behest of the quartermaster general. He was supposed to stay aboard the damn frigate and inspect the defences from there, but for some bloody reason he came ashore and started surveying them. With a compass and measuring chains, can you believe? He only left when the bloody Persians told him to bugger off!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack laughed along with Stalker. He’d had no idea that Ballard could be so brazen, or so brave.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It seemed a good idea, sir. We weren’t actually at war at that stage.’ Ballard spoke as if he could not understand that there was anything remarkable in his exploits. ‘It seemed expedient.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’re bloody priceless, Ballard. Expedient indeed. I only wish a few more of my officers were like you. We’d have the damn Shah on his knees and begging for mercy within the week. Oh, for Christ’s sake, what now?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack started at the admonishment before he realised it was directed towards a pair of naval officers who had entered the tent.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thank my lucky stars. The bloody webfoots have arrived.’ Stalker turned to his aide. ‘Hunter, it appears I shall have to delay my Persian lesson. Tell the damned teacher to wait around and to not bloody disappear like he did last time.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The general looked hard at Ballard, who seemed amused to hear that the division’s commander was taking the trouble to learn the local language. ‘Don’t look like you are trying to hide a fart at a wedding, Ballard. It was Commodore Fetherstone’s idea, not mine. And we cannot have the bloody navy pretending they know better than we do, so I agreed to share their munshi, as did Hunter.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I think it is a capital notion, sir.’ Ballard did his best to smile. ‘I only wish I had the time to follow your example.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Stalker snorted. ‘You pompous ass. Off you go, Hunter. Tell the man to wait.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Very good, sir. Gentlemen, please excuse me.’ Captain Hunter took the opportunity to slip away. ‘Good luck with it all, Fenris. Please do come and find me if I can be of any further assistance.’ He gave Jack a genial smile as he escaped. Already a small group of staff officers were hovering at his desk, anxiously waiting for his attention.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Stalker thrust his chair backwards and lumbered to his feet to greet the approach of the two naval officers. ‘What now, gentlemen?’ he barked when the new arrivals were still several paces away. ‘Can the navy not manage without my damn guidance for more than a few hours?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Good afternoon, Stalker.’ The shorter of the two officers greeted the major general with a warm smile, despite the less than friendly greeting. ‘We came ashore with a few of our guests and I thought I should do you the courtesy of paying you a visit.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘A few guests! What does the navy think this is? A damn holiday?’ Stalker slumped back into his chair, his face creased into a scowl. He waved a hand in Ballard’s direction. ‘You know Ballard?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Indeed, sir.’ The two naval officers nodded in greeting.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘This is one of his men . . .’ Stalker frowned for a moment. ‘I have forgotten your name, Captain.’ There was no hint of apology in the bland statement.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fenris, sir.’ Jack reached forward and shook the hands offered in his direction. It was hard not to be overawed. He had been on campaign before, yet he had barely seen the senior officers at whose command hundreds, if not thousands, of men would march to their deaths. It was their decisions that would secure victory or else see the army shattered and broken, the troops fleeing for their lives. Generals on campaign were as close to being God as a mortal man could ever hope to be.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘May I introduce Rear Admiral Sir Henry Leeke, commander of our naval forces, and Commodore Fetherstone of naval intelligence.’ Ballard made the introductions smoothly. Jack thought he detected a warning tone in his voice, but Stalker gave him no chance to dwell on the thought.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Enough of this piss and wind.’ The general was in the process of dispatching another dozen sheets of paper to their grave on the floor behind his chair. ‘I have enough to bloody do without listening to you lot carrying on like we are at some damn garden party.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The four officers shared a smile.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘We will leave you, sir.’ Ballard seized the opportunity to depart. ‘I will give my report to Captain Hunter.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Stalker fluttered his fingers in the briefest acknowledgement. Jack followed Ballard out of the tent, happy to escape.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Ballard, a moment of your time.’ The voice called them to a halt before they had gone more than a dozen paces from Stalker’s tent. They turned to see Commodore Fetherstone hurrying after them.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir?’ Ballard enquired politely.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The naval officer puffed his cheeks as he came to a halt. He was much older than Ballard, his thick mutton chops and thin crop of hair completely grey. His face was lined and weathered by a lifetime spent at sea, but his blue eyes were keen.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I wonder if you could send me a copy of your report on the defences at Reshire. I would like to see how well it tallies with my own.’ Fetherstone made the request seem trivial, but Jack saw Ballard’s eyes narrow at the suggestion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course, sir. I would be delighted.’ There was little hint of pleasure in Ballard’s icy reply.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Obliged to you. I will of course extend the same courtesy and send you the navy’s own intelligence.’ Fetherstone’s small head bobbed forward as he replied. He looked like an undernourished starling pecking at a crumb.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It is very kind of you to offer, sir, but there really is no need. I doubt we missed anything.’ Ballard’s opinion of the navy’s intelligence-gathering skills was evident in his less than enthusiastic reply.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack realised that Fetherstone’s role was similar to Ballard’s. It was also clear that there was little love lost between the two rival intelligence officers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Our gunboats have drawn an accurate account of the enemy’s position, with an estimate of their numbers,’ Fetherstone continued, despite Ballard’s belligerence. ‘I appreciate it may not be quite as good as a survey on foot, but I warrant you could use the information, if only as a counterbalance to your own. We cannot risk any oversight.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Of course,’ Ballard replied through gritted teeth.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone turned his attention to Jack. ‘Captain Fenris, I am surprised we have not met before. You must be a recent attachment to Major Ballard’s department.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack saw the keenness in the older officer’s stare. Fetherstone missed nothing. ‘That’s correct, sir. My transfer came through shortly before embarkation.’ He was smooth in his reply.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘How interesting. Where were you stationed before? The rest of the 15th are back in merry old England. I had no idea we had another of their officers still with us.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard took a step forward and spoke before Jack could respond. ‘You must excuse us, sir. I am sure you have as much to do as we do. Perhaps we can continue this fascinating conversation when we don’t have an enemy to fight.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Fetherstone smiled at Ballard’s sarcasm. ‘Oh, we all have plenty to do. You would be amazed what we get up to in naval intelligence.’ He said nothing more, and retreated to Stalker’s tent with only a fleeting nod of farewell.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Odd fellow,’ Jack remarked. Something in the commodore’s manner had struck him as strange. ‘You clearly don’t like him.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘He’s a webfoot. We really shouldn’t expect too much.’ Ballard was scathing. ‘It’s bloody typical of him to pry, the nosy old beggar. You would’ve thought he would have learnt some manners at his age.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At least he is trying to teach Stalker some new tricks, although I was surprised that he has agreed to learn Persian. He doesn’t seem the type.’ Jack was intrigued by the idea. He had spent a long time living amidst people without sharing their language, though he had picked up a little along the way.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t let that act of Stalker’s distract you. The man knows what he is about. The bluster is just a facade.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Well he does a bloody good job of playing the buffoon.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard shook his head. ‘Do not judge so quickly. There is more to many men than one would first assume.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack contemplated the advice. Coming from Ballard, it meant something. The Devil had a composure about him that Jack envied. Nothing appeared to surprise or shock him. The notion led him to think of Stalker’s story. ‘Did you really go ashore and measure the Persian defences?’ He asked the question with genuine interest. He had done a few rash things in his time. It was nice to hear of another’s madcap exploits.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard looked at Jack as if he sensed mockery. ‘I did. I cannot bear to get things wrong. It seemed the only way to be accurate.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shook his head. ‘It is a good job you found me. I’ll put a stop to that sort of bloody nonsense before you get yourself killed.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Ballard gave his short bark of a laugh. ‘Then I shall count myself doubly fortunate for having unravelled the mystery of your identity.’ He leant forward and clapped Jack on the shoulder before leading him away.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They had gone no more than a few paces when a party of a dozen heavily laden sailors blocked their path. The matelots were weighed down with luggage, a bewildering assortment of portmanteaus, cases, hatboxes and canvas-wrapped parcels that looked more suited to a stay at a fine Bombay hotel than a dusty campaign field.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I thought orders forbade any baggage.’ Jack watched the procession with envy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They did. But I doubt they apply to her.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked across to the rear of the party of sailors. A pair of civilians were strolling along behind the sweating men tasked with carrying their heavy luggage. They walked with calm detachment, as if on a pleasant excursion rather than in the midst of an army preparing for war.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s breath stuck in his throat as he recognised the woman whose figure being admired by every red-coated and red-blooded man in the vicinity. He caught her eye and felt a tingle of lust shimmer down his spine as she met his stare, her own shock evident in the widening of her eyes.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s lover had come to join the campaign. And from the look on her face, he was the last person on earth she had expected to find.</p>
