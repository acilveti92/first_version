				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Outram stood close to the British artillery as they limbered up their guns now that the fight was done. He surveyed the field of battle, his glasses panning slowly from side to side as he tried to understand the fight that he had missed. He had only returned to command the army once the attack was well under way, the injury he had suffered the previous night keeping him from the field until the day was nearly done.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">His men had won him a spectacular victory, the efforts of the artillery and the heroism of the cavalry ending the Persian resistance before the bulk of his army could even be brought into play. Outram had achieved the first aim of his campaign. The Persian army would never again be able to face the British expeditionary force without remembering the fight at the village of Khoosh-Ab. He might not have been able to inflict a complete defeat and utterly destroy the Persian field army, but he had secured the foothold he needed so that he could launch the second phase of his campaign, which would see his force strike further inland. He would keep fighting until the Shah accepted defeat and sued for terms. The British public would be pleased and his masters at Horseguards would nod in approval. He might have hoped for more, but for now his men had done enough.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Outram lit a cigar and watched as the British infantry marched towards the remains of the position that the Persian army had occupied. The enemy battalions had fled, leaving behind their dead and wounded. The British had been allowed to complete their advance in peace, the horror of the enemy bombardment fading as they pressed forward, the beat of the drums the only sound marking their passage.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The redcoats were marching into a butcher’s yard.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British artillery barrage had been dreadfully effective. Corpses lay in heaps, the mangled bodies a testament to the skill of the gunners. The ground was soaked in blood. Shattered limbs and ragged flesh smothered the sandy soil. The bowels of hell were revealed for all to see.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The first British line marched on, driving after the remnants of the Persian infantry, which streamed away on to the plain behind where they had made their failed stand. The redcoats would not go far, for the enemy was retreating too fast, the Persian soldiers running from the victors in disarray, discarding their weapons as they fled for their lives.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The British cavalry rode after the broken ranks, doing their best to harry the retreat and add fresh impetus to the rout. Yet they had fought hard that day and their horses were blown, the riders exhausted. Without fresh cavalry coming after them, much of the enemy infantry would be able to make good their escape, the shattered ranks heading back to the haven of the high ground and the places where they would be able to re-form. The British army’s shortage of cavalry was hampering the pursuit, denying Outram the ability to turn the Persian retreat into a catastrophic defeat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The general began to issue his orders. The young officers on his staff were sent galloping across the plain as they carried his instructions to the battalion commanders. The second line of British infantry was to halt as soon as it reached the ground where the Persian army had made its fateful stand. The three battalions in the rearmost line of the assault had taken the majority of the day’s casualties and Outram wanted to give them time to regroup and tend to their wounded. The men in the first line would be recalled to spend the rest of the day and the night that would follow on the field of battle. Outram had his victory and now, finally, his men could rest.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Lieutenant Knightly tried very hard not to be sick in front of his men. He walked amongst the bodies of enemy soldiers who had been living just a few hours before. He wondered how they had felt as the British barrage crashed into their ranks. Had they believed they would be the fortunate ones; that they could not be amongst the fallen? Or had they sensed death coming for them, somehow foreseeing what was going to befall them?</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He shivered as he remembered the long advance. The sight of the broken bodies made a mockery of his pathetic hopes that he would not die; that it would always be someone else whose body was broken, whose blood would flow to run into the dusty soil. He saw death in all its grotesque butchery and knew then that it was only a matter of chance whether he lived or whether his own flesh was to be tattered and torn, his corpse left to lie forgotten on some foreign field.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly looked up into the calm face of his covering sergeant. He saw the pity in the man’s eyes and it shamed him. He forced himself to stand straighter and fight away the horror.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Yes, Sergeant?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Isn’t that your chum over there?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly looked in the direction of the sergeant’s pointing arm. He was not surprised to see a hussar officer who had no business being in the field of battle. He shook off the dread that had crushed his spirits since the first cannon had opened fire. The battle was over and he had survived. It was time to move on.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He ordered his sergeant to fall the company out and to wait for orders. With his duty completed, he forced his fears away and trotted over to see just what his friend was up to.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">‘Arthur! What the devil is going on!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly puffed out his cheeks. The run had left him out of breath and the hurried question had him gasping for air. He had arrived to see his friend holding two officers prisoner at gunpoint. Both were dressed in a uniform he did not recognise, but he was sure that neither would pose much of a threat. To see a raised weapon seemed rather melodramatic now that the battle was done.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Arthur, if these men have surrendered, you should put your gun down.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He watched his friend’s face closely. He saw the grime that covered his face, the flecks of blood that had been splattered across his cheeks. His uniform was filthy and there was a thin crust of blood across one thigh. Knightly looked into his bloodshot eyes and saw the anger burning deep within.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The taller of the two prisoners spread his arms, showing the British officers that he was unarmed. His face twitched, a spasm of what might have been fear twisting his mouth. Knightly had seen enough.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Arthur. Put the gun down.’ He spoke slowly, as if to a difficult child. He was ignored. ‘Arthur!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The prisoner looked at Knightly, his eyes beseeching the red-coated officer to come to his aid. He opened his mouth, releasing a torrent of words. It was a language Knightly did not understand, but the meaning was clear. His fellow officer was tormenting the two men. Now that the battle was over, it was a gratuitous display, and Knightly knew he would have to bring it to an end.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He thought about calling for his men to come to his aid. Jack and his two prisoners were partially hidden by a fold in the terrain that kept them out of sight of the redcoats, most of whom had already sunk to the ground, finding the few clear spaces not littered with bodies. Knightly did not have the heart to march over and force them back to their feet, so he sucked up his courage and tried to intercede once again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Arthur. You are scaring the poor fellows witless. It’s over now. The battle is finished. Let me take them back to battalion. You look done in.’ He tried to sound light-hearted, and even offered a short laugh as he attempted to shake off the tension in the air. He took a step forward as if he were going to push the gun aside.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stay where you are.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The command was snapped and angry. It stopped Knightly in his tracks. The young lieutenant felt the first flutter of fear deep in his belly. The battle was over, but he sensed the presence of death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack did his best to keep his gun steady. The exhaustion threatened to overwhelm him, and his arm was aching from shoulder to wrist from having fought for so long. He had heard Knightly arrive but he did his best to pay the junior officer no heed. He kept his eyes fixed on the taller of the two Russians, who stared back without fear. It was only when the British lieutenant started to intervene that Jack was forced to act.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Stay where you are.’ His voice rasped as he gave the order. He looked into the Russian’s eyes as he spoke to Knightly, sensing that the man understood his words. ‘I’m going to shoot these bastards if they don’t tell me what I want to know.’ He saw the flicker of understanding, the slightest narrowing of the eyes as the Russian officer planned his next move. He knew he could not afford to drop his guard, not even for a single heartbeat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian had a hard face. His left cheek bore a single thin scar that linked the corner of his mouth to his ear. His black hair was flecked with grey, his thin moustache showing the first signs of losing its colour. He looked more like a veteran soldier than a diplomatic observer. He stared at Jack for a long time. Jack met the scrutiny calmly, revealing nothing. The second officer, who was much younger, took a tiny half-step backwards, as if trying to edge away from the wild-eyed British officer of hussars who threatened murder on a battlefield.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I surrender.’ The older officer spoke in English for the first time. He spat to one side, as if the language had left a sour taste in his mouth. ‘Now put the gun down, Captain, and I will offer you my parole.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled, the dirt that crusted his face pulling at his skin. ‘So you do speak English. But then of course you would. You wouldn’t be here otherwise.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘So let us go.’ The Russian sneered, defiant even with a revolver aimed at him. ‘We are not here to fight. My country is not at war with yours. We are here as peaceful observers, nothing more.’ He scowled as he offered the response. It was clear that surrendering was not an easy thing for him to do.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned his gaze back on Knightly. His eyes were like steel. There was no trace of fear. Just a quiet, simmering anger. ‘Tell your friend he is to let me come with you. Tell him to let us go.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Arthur.’ Knightly used his friend’s name gently. It was clear that both men terrified him. He looked like a small boy summoned to bear witness to his first bare-knuckle fight. ‘I’ll take them back to our lines.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You will do no such thing.’ Jack lifted the barrel of his gun an inch, aiming it directly at the Russian officer’s forehead.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian turned away from the fresh-faced young officer who was being so roundly ignored and focused his attention on the lean face of the man with the gun. ‘What do you want, Englishman?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Tell me why you are here.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian smiled. It did not come close to reaching his eyes. ‘I am an observer.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Bollocks.’ Jack raised his voice for the first time. ‘You’re a fucking spy.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘And you are a madman.’ The Russian turned his pale eyes on Knightly again. ‘Get this man away from me.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Shut your fucking muzzle,’ Jack snarled. ‘I know who you are and why you are here. I want to know the identity of the spy in the British camp. The spy who reports to you. You will tell me or I will kill you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Arthur!’ Knightly had gone pale.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Be quiet!’ Jack turned his head to glare at Knightly for the first time.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It gave the Russian the opening he had waited for so patiently. He stepped forward and punched Jack hard, the blow rising fast and connecting squarely with the side of his head. Jack staggered away from the impact, his ear ringing and his vision clouding. The Russian closed on him quickly, fists hammering away at his body. Jack tried to twist away from the blows, but the Russian was relentless. Another punch smashed into his stomach, followed by a further one that knocked the revolver from his hand, sending it spinning away. He lifted his arms and tried to fight back, but he felt the strength leaving his body as the Russian pummelled at him without pause. A fist connected with his jaw and he fell.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He hit the ground hard. He tried to get back to his feet, but the Russian gave no quarter, kicking out with his heavy boots as Jack scrabbled in the dirt in a futile attempt to escape.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">A kick caught him in the pit of his gut, driving the air from his lungs. The pain flared bright and he couldn’t breathe. He opened his mouth, but the dust choked him. He writhed on to his side, desperate to get some air into his lungs, but the Russian flopped on top of him, straddling his battered body. He tried to push him away, but the other man laughed and batted his flailing fists aside before reaching forward to take his throat in a vice-like grip.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was choking, his neck crushed under the Russian’s thick fingers. His lungs screamed, the last of his breath roaring in his ears. In desperation he tried to hammer his head forward, seeking to batter his way free. The Russian saw the attempt and forced Jack’s head backwards, grinding it into the dust.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s vision faded. His lungs screamed out in agony, the need to breathe torturing him. He let his body go limp, his mind still trying to find a way out even as the Russian throttled him. He had one last chance, a final, desperate gamble. A glimmer of hope as the darkness rushed forward to claim him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The younger Russian had leapt at Knightly in the moments after Jack had fallen. Knightly had not moved, unable to do anything but stare in horror at the sudden eruption of violence in front of him. The Russian officer was as fast as a viper and he had his sword held at Knightly’s throat before the British lieutenant could even think of drawing his own. He tried to step away, but the Russian pushed the blade forward, scoring it into the soft flesh at the base of Knightly’s neck. The sharpened steel drew blood and Knightly went completely still, held fast by the threat of death.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He felt his body begin to shake. He watched the Russian batter Jack into bloody submission, powerless to intervene. He felt frozen, his whole being mesmerised by the vicious blade that hovered under his chin. He could smell the sheen of oil on the polished steel, the metallic tang catching in the back of his throat. With the point cutting into his flesh, he could do nothing but watch events in stupefied terror.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The hard-eyed Russian officer stepped away from Jack’s body. Knightly felt his throat close in horror as he saw the limp figure on the ground. His friend was dying no more than half a dozen paces away and he could do nothing to save him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Russian officer glanced once at Knightly before bending to snatch the fallen revolver from the ground. With practised ease he brought the gun around, aiming it at the body of the hussar officer who had tried to capture him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘No!’ Knightly screamed, the dreadful sound exploding from his lips.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He saw a thin smile appear on the Russian’s scarred face as he cocked the weapon. He lifted the revolver a fraction of an inch and then turned to look at Knightly. His eyes bored into the young officer, daring him to move. The revolver remained pointing at Jack’s skull. At such close range the Russian couldn’t miss. He smirked at Knightly, relishing his distress.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With a final twist of his lips, the Russian pulled the trigger.</p>
