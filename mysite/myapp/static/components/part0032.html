				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">The army slipped away in the late afternoon. There was little grandeur to the departure, no martial spectacle to awe the inhabitants of Bushire.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The baggage and supply carts stayed behind. The encampment was trusted to the care of Lieutenant Colonel Shepheard, whose men were reinforced by a party of seamen from the ships moored in the harbour. Outram was gambling on a quick march to take the Persian general by surprise, but he was cautious enough to ensure that he had a secure base to fall back to.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men marched with no more than two days’ rations in their knapsacks, bread and beef for the redcoats, chapattis for the native infantry. Their pouches and cartouches were full of ammunition, their rifles and muskets cleaned and ready for battle. Once again they were left to find rest without their tents, the need for speed overriding any thought of comfort.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Close to four thousand men marched in two long lines of contiguous quarter columns. Most came from the force that had achieved victory at Reshire. The daily route marches had hardened them. The fight at the Dutch fort had proved that they could best the enemy. They advanced with confidence, eager to bring the enemy to battle, ready to prove that Great Britain’s will could not be flouted.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The force would march through the night. It would be a treacherous process. The land they would cross started out as little more than a swamp. The damp air was full of deadly exhalations, the men certain that the foul smell was sure to carry disease. The choice of route left the redcoats wondering at the sanity of their masters for subjecting the army to such a deadly miasma. Yet it was the only way off the Bushire peninsula. Once they had marched around the head of the Bushire creek, they could strike inland, into the desert that separated the coastal lands from the dry, featureless interior.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They would have to cover the ground quickly and then summon the energy and willpower to fight. For the Persian army was gathering its strength. The Shah’s orders were clear. His commander, Shooja-ool-Moolk, was to force the invaders back into the sea. The invasion must be stopped.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack enjoyed the feeling of being back in the saddle. He had borrowed a roan mare from Outram’s stables and had joined the procession of staff officers surrounding the commander-in-chief. It felt strange not to be marching with a battalion, though. He missed it. There was a security in being in the midst of hundreds of redcoats. A knowledge that whatever you faced, you faced it together. This time he rode towards battle accountable for no one other than himself. He would not be expected to show the courage that defined a true leader. In all likelihood he would not even be called on to fight. Ballard had stressed the need to keep out of the battle, no matter what urge came upon him. He would not be allowed to transgress again.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The ground underneath his horse’s hooves gave out an obscene squelch as the weight of horse and rider squashed the matted fibres of the earth together, forcing up small puddles of water that slowly disappeared back into the swampy soil. It would be hellish for the redcoats and the native infantry, who would be forced to march straight through the marshland. The sodden soil would all too soon turn into a quagmire, the rearmost battalions left to slog their way through a sea of mud.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">But Outram’s orders had been clear. The enemy awaited and so the army must march with haste, lest the chance to bring them to battle was lost.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">The wind howled across the barren plain. Bushire was far behind them and the redcoats were battling their way inland. The marshland of the peninsula had given way to scrub, the featureless terrain affording the men nothing to look at other than the occasional scattering of date trees, or an ancient fortified tower standing guard over the precious wells that gave life to the desolate land. Not that they could see much in the impenetrable gloom of the night.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The wind-battered troops were covered in muck. The relentless wind kicked up huge clouds of dusty soil, which swirled and twisted across the arid plain. Still they trudged onwards, gritting their teeth against the tempest, forcing their legs to move, each heavy tread taking them one pace closer to their objective.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was suffering. He had not been in the saddle for weeks, and it felt as if his backside had been rubbed raw by the constant contact. His tight-fitting hussar’s uniform chafed, making every movement of the horse a misery. The wind drove the sandy soil into his face, the dusty, friable surface that had seemed such a boon after the morass of the swampland transformed into a virulent enemy by the gale that had assaulted them for hours.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">When he could take no more, he left Ballard and the staff behind and forced his tiring horse to catch up with the 64th, who marched at the front of one of the twin columns. He went to seek company, to find a friendly face to stave off the monotonous suffering of the advance.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Lieutenant Knightly was with his company. The men had long been allowed to march easy. Few had the energy to chatter with their mess mates, the long trudge wearing down their reserves of strength.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I say, you lucky blighter.’ Knightly spotted Jack’s arrival and lifted his face to peer up at his friend, who enjoyed the fortune of being mounted. ‘Have you come to gloat?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack ignored the barbed comment and slid from the saddle, wincing as the movement burned his tortured flesh. It was a relief to be on the ground, but his legs thought differently and nearly gave out underneath him as they were forced to take his weight for the first time in hours.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Steady there, sir.’ A strong arm reached out and set him on his feet. The sergeant gave him a friendly smile, accepting his thanks with the briefest nod of his head. Like all officers, Knightly was covered by an NCO, an experienced sergeant whose job it was to make certain that their officer survived in battle, giving the battalion’s leaders the freedom to do their job without having to concentrate solely on their own safety.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘It’s a crappy night, Sergeant.’ Jack stretched his spine, his hand kneading the small of his back that was cramped and aching from the hours in the saddle. ‘How are the men?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t worry about us, sir.’ The sergeant shot a gap-toothed grin back at Jack. ‘A scrap of wind ain’t going to bother the likes of us. You should save your worry for the cavalry. Your lot don’t take kindly to this sort of thing.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled at the comment. He still thought of himself as an ordinary foot soldier, no matter what type of uniform he happened to be wearing.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s because the horses have more sense.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The troops marching around them found the energy to laugh, or at least grin, at the exchange. Jack relished the contact. He had not appreciated how much he would miss being with the men who made up the rank and file of the army.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack reached into his saddlebag and fished out a bottle of brandy, which he handed to the sergeant. ‘Share this around, Sergeant.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The man looked at Jack and grinned in appreciation. ‘That is rare kind of you, sir. Much obliged.’ He took a huge draught before handing the bottle and its precious contents to the man at his side. Then he turned and, without missing a step, called to the redcoat marching behind him, ‘Thatcher, take the gentleman’s horse.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack handed the reins of his borrowed mare to a boy who looked no more than sixteen years old. The youngster smiled nervously and took a firm hold on the greasy leather.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Don’t let her go, lad. You’d be paying her back for the rest of your service.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The boy paled at the words. Jack laughed and clapped him on the back before turning and placing an arm on Knightly’s shoulder and steering him a few paces away from the column.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You’re good with the men.’ Knightly looked pale.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They are good boys. You’re lucky.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘They terrify me.’ Knightly was too tired to hide his anxiety. ‘They only do what I say because Sergeant Rogerson tells them to.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled. He knew the feeling well. ‘You’ll get the hang of it. Show them that you are willing to share every hardship and danger they face. Make sure they know what you expect them to do and then show them how to do it. That’s it. It’s that simple.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You should write a book.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack would have laughed, but a spasm of pain seared down his spine and for a heartbeat he thought his legs would give out. He kneaded the tense flesh in the pit of his back until the feeling passed, then stretched, arching his spine in a vague attempt to ease the discomfort. ‘I doubt I have the right credentials to write a book aimed at young gentlemen.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What’s it like?’ Knightly asked the question quietly.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘What’s what like?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Battle. Real battle, I mean.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack heard the fear in the young officer’s voice. He sounded like an earnest schoolboy asking a friend what it felt like to kiss a girl. The two of them walked on together in silence, both hunched forward as they battled through the sand that flayed into their faces.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Nothing will prepare you for when you first go under fire,’ Jack began hesitantly. He had never spoken so seriously of battle before. It was not the done thing, especially for an officer. All such talk was done in jest, the whole grisly affair discussed lightly, as if it was nothing more than a game.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He recognised Knightly’s terror. There was little he could say that would assuage the young man’s fear – Knightly would have to wrestle with that alone – but he wanted to help if he could, and so he forced open his soul, delving into the darkness that he usually kept locked away as he searched for the words to comfort his friend.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘At first, it is worse than you can ever imagine.’ He looked up and saw Knightly staring at him intently. ‘But then the fear goes.’ There was doubt on the young man’s face. ‘Truly. It goes. You forget to be afraid and you do what you have to.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘That’s when you kill them.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack heard the tremor in Knightly’s voice. ‘Yes. That’s when you kill them.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I’m not sure I can do that.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You can and you will.’ Jack tried not to sound harsh, but he heard the steel in his reply. ‘Because if you don’t, they will kill you.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I understand.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You had better. It’s not as easy as you think.’ Jack sighed. ‘Men die hard. They go down kicking and screaming and they will still try to kill you even if you have your sword buried in their damn guts.’ He looked across at Knightly and saw the younger man hanging on his every word. ‘Don’t hold anything back when you fight. Go at them with everything you have.’ Jack grimaced as he remembered the harder fights he had lived through. ‘And don’t forget to turn your bloody wrist.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I won’t forget.’ Knightly looked appalled at the idea.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘You had better not. I’ve seen a dying man drive a bayonet straight back though the officer who had struck him, just because the stupid fool forgot to turn his wrist.’ Jack glared at Knightly, reinforcing the message.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly looked at him, his eyes betraying the terror in his soul. ‘I don’t want to die. When I think of not existing . . .’ His voice tailed off.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘There is nothing you can do about that. Everybody dies.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly sniffed, barely in control of his emotions. ‘It’s easy for you. You’ve done it before.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack laughed grimly. It was not a pleasant sound. ‘Oh, it doesn’t get easier. I sometimes feel I have a ration of courage. There are times when I think it’s gone. Then, in battle, I feel this madness. Nothing matters then. I suppose I lose my mind. And that terrifies me even more the next time.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly watched Jack closely as he confessed his fear. He nodded slowly, as if coming to an understanding with his own emotions.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘I don’t know how you can go back. To battle, I mean.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack shivered, despite the warmth of the night. ‘At first you think you are immune, that nothing can happen to you. It will always be some other fellow who will die. Then you see so many men get hit that you realise it could happen to you. So maybe the only way to survive is to be more careful. But then, when the lead is flying and the enemy come at you, you find that you fight just as hard anyway, no matter how much you have told yourself to take it easy and let someone else do the crazy stuff. That’s when you realise that one day it is going to happen to you. No matter what you do. And that’s when it gets tough, when you know it’s just a matter of time.’ He looked at Knightly, trying to see the effect of his words. ‘Then you can either carry on or give up. And some of us don’t have the option of giving up.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Knightly didn’t speak. He seemed lost in another world. It was several minutes before he looked at Jack and forced out a tired smile. ‘What a life.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack smiled in return. ‘You chose to be an officer. The men have called you “sir” and done what you tell them. Now it’s your turn to pay for that respect. You have to do your best because that’s what they deserve. That, my friend, is the key. Your responsibility to the men comes first. Even before your own life.’ He reached out and placed his hand on the younger man’s shoulder. ‘Don’t worry. You’ll be fine.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">They marched on in silence. Every step taking them closer to the place they both feared most of all.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Battle.</p>
