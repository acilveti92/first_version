				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘Gallop!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Forbes bellowed the command. The squadron picked up speed. The horses moved willingly, carrying their masters to the slaughter without hesitation.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack never once took his eyes off the Persian square. Even as his horse powered forward, he watched the barrels of the muskets that pointed towards him. He was pulling away from his men, his charger faster than the mounts issued to his troopers, but he did not care. Nothing mattered save the need to reach the enemy and try to force a way into the wall of bayonets.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The distance closed with terrifying speed.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He could see the muskets wavering as the infantrymen struggled to hold them still, the heavy bayonets at the tip making the weapons unwieldy. A Persian officer stood with the second rank. Jack watched the fear etched on the man’s face as he stared aghast at the racing cavalry. He saw too the determination as the enemy officer waited for the British horsemen to come into range.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Persian officer opened his mouth. Jack was close enough to see the muskets steady, the infantry stiffening their muscles as they braced for the brutal kick that would follow a heartbeat after they pulled their triggers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Forbes turned and glanced at his command. He caught Jack’s eye. Jack tried to read the emotion in the man’s gaze, but the stare was too intense. Forbes was still looking at him when the Persians fired.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The storm of musket balls tore through the air. Jack flinched uncontrollably, his body reacting to the sound of the missiles scorching past.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The volley smashed into the line of galloping troopers.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Men were snatched from the saddle as the musket balls tore into their flesh. Horses were struck down, their bodies crashing to the ground, their riders thrown to the dusty soil. The sound of the dozen or more impacts was dreadful, like the meaty slap of a butcher slamming a fresh carcass on to the chopping block.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The screaming began.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Horses shrieked, their bellows of agony tearing at the hearts of the troopers who rode past the carnage unscathed. Men screamed, their bodies shattered by enemy bullets or by a violent connection with the ground.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Bombay Lights did not falter.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Even as they galloped forward, they closed the ranks, callously ignoring the fallen, thinking of nothing but reaching the enemy. They raced on, their bloodied sabres held ready for the Persians who stood in their path.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Forbes still led them. His breeches ran with red from a bullet wound to his leg, but he charged onwards nonetheless, throwing his head back as he bellowed the final order that would send his precious regiment against the enemy that had killed so many of the men under his command.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Charge!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The men responded. They roared as they went, their terror released, and the regiment surged forward.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack let the madness take him. He screamed as he raced forward, the certainty of his imminent death releasing a soul-searing shriek that came from the very core of his being.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The Persian soldiers held their ground. The smoke of their volley billowed around them. The closest flank of the square stood firm, the vicious weapons bristling outwards, creating an obstacle that no horse could penetrate.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Adjutant Moore was in the van. Forbes fell behind, his tiring horse slowing his progress. The younger of the two brothers would have seen the wall of bayonets ahead of him, the hundreds of faces standing behind the seventeen inches of steel bayonet.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He did not turn away. He held his line, spurring his horse hard. The willing animal tore towards the wall as if it were nothing more than a hedgerow on a day’s hunt.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Moore set his horse at the square. He released his sabre, letting it fall, trusting to the thick cord around his wrist to keep it at his side, both hands needed to control his mount. With a final desperate yell, he urged the animal to jump.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">It soared up, its hooves scrabbling at the air as it tried to vault the wall of bayonets. They came for it the moment it left the ground. Dozens of sharpened steel blades tore at its flesh, the vicious points ripping through its soft underbelly. The Persian officer who had controlled the volley lifted his pistol and fired at the madman who had tried to break the square. The bullet took the animal in the side of the head, smashing through skull and brain, killing it in an instant.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The stricken beast crashed into the Persian soldiers, crushing the nearest men, whole files smashed by the impact. It kicked out as it died, knocking more men to the ground, its iron-shod hooves breaking bones as they lashed out. Moore was thrown, his final roar of anger turned into a scream of terror as he went down with his horse.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Captain Forbes watched in horror, yet still he did not pause. He shortened his reins, bunching them tightly into his left hand before spurring his own horse forward and leaping at the square, following Moore’s line so that he jumped over the chaos the adjutant’s dying horse had created.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was lucky. With so many Persians struck down by the falling horse, there were few bayonets left in position. He surged over the wall, landing on the far side without coming to harm.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned hard, slashing his sabre at the rear rank. He fought in silence, jaw clenched, teeth bared, attacking the files that had been crushed by Moore’s wild charge, thrusting his horse at the last men left standing. His sword took a man in the face, and a visceral roar escaped his gritted teeth before he struck another Persian infantryman to the ground. He urged his horse forward, riding it over the bodies of the men he had killed, forcing an opening in what remained of the square’s flank. His bloodied sabre hacked at a musket, battering it to one side before he thrust the point into the man’s neck.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He turned, his war cry faltering as he found no one left close enough to fight.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">There was a gap in the square.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Jack had seen the two officers jump the wall of bayonets. He had watched in mounting horror as Moore fell. The sight sickened him and he cursed the fool’s courage that had driven the young officer to the hopeless act. Then he saw Forbes land unharmed. He pulled at his own reins, realigning his horse so that he was heading for the place where the two officers had leapt, a sudden rush of hope surging through him.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The wall ahead was blocked, the rear ranks still standing, their bayonets holding the line. Then Forbes struck. More men fell, and Jack saw the opening.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He raced for the gap. He saw the look of terror on the Persian soldiers’ faces as they realised what had happened. A thin-faced officer stepped forward, blocking the hole in the ranks, trying to seal it off alone.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack roared in anger. He spurred his horse hard, urging it to find a final surge of speed. More Persian infantrymen were rushing to close the gap, their muskets raised, bayonets pushing forward.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">With a valiant effort, his horse responded. Jack felt its body tense beneath him as it strained with the last of its strength. The final yards rushed past, then Jack was slashing his talwar downwards, beating away the bayonets that reached for him as he raced through the opening. He felt a blade slice through his left calf, the blinding flash of pain the last thing he noticed before he was through and into the centre of the square.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He had been prepared to die, certain that the decision to charge the square would send the squadron to its doom. The sudden release and the hope of life surged through him, mixing with the horror and the fear to fuel the intoxicating madness of battle.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He cut down the nearest man, his blade ripping away the Persian’s throat. He felt nothing as the man fell, his only thought to find more of the enemy to kill. The thin-faced officer who had tried to seal the gap came at him. His curved sabre slashed forward but Jack blocked the blade, knocking it to one side, then kicked out, driving the point of his boot into the officer’s face. The man reeled backwards and Jack spurred forward, standing tall in his stirrups before smashing his sword down on to the man’s skull, killing him with the single blow.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He reined his mount away, turning it back into the gap that had been created. There were bodies everywhere. Some lay still, their bloody flesh a testament to the skill of the two British officers who had made it into the square. Others were staggering to their feet, rushing to recover after having been knocked to the ground by Moore’s falling horse.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The gap was closing. Men from the opposite face were rushing forward, led by an experienced vekil who had grabbed a section from the third rank without waiting for orders, knowing that his battalion faced destruction if they let the British cavalry into the square.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Forbes had been surrounded and forced into a desperate defence against half a dozen bayonets. More men were being summoned to the unequal fight, the Persian officers trying to end the resistance of the British cavalrymen who had found a way into the square.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Adjutant Moore was pinned under his fallen horse. He fought on, slashing his broken sword against any who came close, his body twisting and writhing as he tried to keep open the channel he had created.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack saw the fresh rush of infantrymen coming and drove his horse at them. He slashed his sabre hard, cutting at the leader of the group, but the man was ready for him and blocked the blow with his musket, then grabbed at Jack’s leg, trying to throw him from the saddle. Jack felt the man’s fingers digging into the flesh of his thigh like claws, and he roared in building frustration as he brought his talwar down, chopping the hilt on to the top of the man’s head. The vekil fell away and Jack threw his horse round, thinking to rush back in a final attempt to keep the opening free and give his troopers a way into the square.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He was too late. The rest of the vekil’s squad had rushed past as their leader wrestled with the foreign horseman. Already they were reaching the opening. The gap was being sealed off. The British officers would soon be trapped. Cut off and alone, they would not stand a chance.</p>
