				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">Jack halted his men well short of the confusion. They sank to their knees, their chests heaving with exertion, and watched the chaos in silence and growing dismay. Redcoats were pushing, punching and battering each other when they should have been fighting the enemy.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack was exhausted and stood doubled over, his hands on his knees, panting like a hound following a long chase after the fox. Finally, he got enough breath into his tortured lungs to allow him to stand up.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The retreating men from the Fusilier Brigade were clawing their way clear. More and more won through, while officers, both on foot and mounted, tried to re-establish control, their bellowed orders adding to the pandemonium.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Like a rock stuck in the middle of a river in flood, the colour party from the Scots Fusiliers stood firm. The routing redcoats were sensible enough to keep a safe distance from the fearsome halberds wielded by the sergeants who guarded the battalion’s colours, defending them even from men from their own side. The colours had become a rallying point for the guardsmen and pockets of men made their way towards the twin flags that flew with pride in the heart of the battalion.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘OK, let’s go,’ Jack ordered his men. He had no option but to make for the one part of the Scots Fusiliers that still had some integrity. ‘Make for the colours.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The easiest route was to move up the slope before turning back to follow the last of the retreating Fusilier Brigade down the incline.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Flanagan loped along beside Jack like an overgrown puppy. As they ran, Jack was forced to keep twisting his neck, trying to keep the colour party in sight while also keeping a sharp watch on the Russians in the redoubt lest they take it into their heads to take advantage of the confusion and push down the slope.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack feared a Russian advance. If the Russians moved fast, they could hit the unformed guardsmen and sweep them back over the Alma with all the ease of a Tartar peasant woman cleaning the dirt from her doorstep. The survivors from the Light Company would be caught between the two groups, a morsel certain to be snapped up by the devouring Russian horde.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sir! Beware right!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Dodds’s shout made Jack turn his head sharply. Two battalions of the Vladmirsky Regiment had jerked into motion. Jack’s fears were about to become reality.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Don’t stop! Run, damn you, run!’ Jack bellowed at his men, urging them to increase the pace. They were still fifty yards short of the colour party. Jack saw with relief that the Scots Fusiliers were aware of the danger. The guardsmen were forming a line across the path of the Russian advance, their ranks reassuringly steady. But there were pitifully few of them to stand against two fresh Russian battalions. No more than two dozen redcoats and a handful of officers and sergeants remained of the Scots Fusiliers’ ordered ranks, far too few to stop the Russians.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s company covered the last few hard yards with their breath coming in tortured gasps. They staggered to a halt in front of a young guards captain who was waving his sword and roaring for more men to rally to the colours. If he was grateful to see Jack and his ragtag company, he did not show it.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Who the devil are you?’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sloames,’ Jack stammered, his breathing still tortured. ‘King’s Royal Fusiliers.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The captain ran a professional eye over the bedraggled men and Jack’s bloodstained and filthy uniform. Whatever he saw must have met with his approval; he reached out a hand and clasped Jack’s shoulder in a firm grip that made him wince. ‘Good fellow. Have your men join the line.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack looked anxiously towards the redoubt. The Russian column had been halted while its officers fussily dressed the ranks which had become disordered because of the numerous bodies that littered the ground. The Russian officers’ pedantry gave the British a precious few moments to try to organise their own men and allow more redcoats to rally to the colours.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack’s men took their place in the formation, adding another twenty rifles to the line. Digby-Brown and Sergeant Baker stood behind the Light Company, helping to dress the line, reaching down to grab ammunition or percussion caps from the many corpses that had been dragged unceremoniously out of the way. More men joined and the line slowly extended across the slope. Jack’s hopes rose. If the Russians delayed much longer and if more men could be rallied, then there was every chance the British could hold the advance long enough for more fresh troops to be brought forward. There was still a chance to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text-1-full-out">Major Peacock staggered down the slope among the last of the retreating Fusilier Brigade. His bald head was slick with blood that flowed freely from a deep wound on his crown down into the thin rim of his hair. The fall from Colonel Morris’s charger had done little to settle his terrified wits and the fusilier major shouted continuously as he tottered drunkenly down the slope.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Fusiliers, retire! Retire! Save yourselves!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Redcoats who had been making for the Scots Fusiliers’ colours heard the new order and stopped in their tracks. In the midst of the confusion, there was no voice to countermand Peacock’s orders. In the absence of any other instructions, the men did as they were told and moved away from their colours towards the river.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack watched in horror. Men desperately needed to block the Russian advance were joining the rout and making their way to the rear.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Digby-Brown, stay here!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">From somewhere, Jack found the strength to run back up the slope to where Peacock staggered along, his braying voice still urging the men to retreat.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sloames!’ The single word exploded from Peacock’s lips, an astonished squeak of recognition. He must have seen the rage in Jack’s eyes, or perhaps the sight of his blood-splattered captain bursting through the retreating mob was too much for his scattered wits. Whatever the cause, Peacock let out a yelp of horror and turned to flee.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack flew at the major, hitting his shoulder against Peacock’s back with such force that both men were knocked off their feet. Jack’s rage drove him on, the pain of the impact barely registering. He flung himself on top of the major’s body, flattening him  and driving the breath from his body.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Sloames, no!’ Peacock raised his hands in terror. ‘Please!’ he begged. ‘Don’t kill me! I don’t want to die! Please!’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack slapped the major’s hands away in disgust and stood up. It would have given him great satisfaction to beat Peacock to a bleeding pulp. But to do so was to stoop to the level of someone like Slater. Jack had embarked on his long charade to lift himself out of the gutter, to prove that whatever the chance of his birth he was capable of so much more than society allowed. Beating Peacock would condemn him as the brutal ruffian the world expected him to be, the kind of vicious creature he so despised.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack reached down and snapped the buckle that held Peacock’s holstered revolver around his waist. He picked up the weapon and turned and walked away. He withdrew the revolver from its holster and snapped the gun open. The weapon had not been fired that day and Jack greeted the sight of the fully loaded chambers with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He did not look back at Peacock lying on the ground. He thrust the revolver into his own holster replacing the one he had lost when he fled Smith’s devastating injury. He made his way back to the line of redcoats, the weight of the revolver against his hip reassuring.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">He risked a glance towards the Russian column. He was relieved to see that they were still halted. The Russian officers were running around the flanks of the columns like sheepdogs worrying a flock of sheep. He had time to rejoin his men. The makeshift British line looked desperately feeble in the face of the two Russian columns but Jack’s mind was clear. He needed to be with his men, whatever their fate.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">The captain from the Scots Fusiliers saw him coming and waved him in, a wry smile on his face.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Thought you might have left us, old man.’</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">Jack grinned at the plummy voice. It would once have caused him to bite his tongue with anger. Now it did not matter. The guards captain was willingly facing the same grim fate he himself was, his privileged birth no protection against the power of a Russian bullet. Here, at least, two men from vastly different backgrounds were equals.</p>
				<p class="bt1-body-text">‘Never.’ Jack smiled, ‘I wouldn’t miss this for the world.’</p>
