				<p class="tsn-typesetter-designer-note">‘He’s gone?’ Jack was astonished.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fenris left an hour ago with the last of Proudfoot’s cavalry. Gone to summon assistance.’ Dutton sounded bone-weary as he replied.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked hard at the British major. For a reason he could not fully fathom, Proudfoot had let him go free, despite Kingsley’s loud protest for him to be locked away. With no other responsibilities to tend to he had sought the major out, bringing with him a bottle of Proudfoot’s brandy to loosen Dutton’s tongue and allow him some solace. Jack had seen the man’s shame. He himself could well remember the heavy burden of having failed when faced with the enemy for the first time. They sat on the defensive wall barricading the small area where the tired sepoys and redcoats huddled together, sharing the harsh spirit and watching in silence as the cantonment burnt. The sounds of the looters were loud in the darkness, the wild, cackling laughter and shrieks of delight reaching the ears of the exhausted redcoats who had been dispersed around the short perimeter.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Occasional gunshots rang out, but whether they were fired in anger or in celebration Jack could not tell. Dutton’s fortress had good fields of fire on three sides, the wide sweep of the parade ground wrapping around the 24th’s barracks, which formed the eastern wall of the defensive line. On the far side of the barracks a series of administrative buildings lined a neat pathway that had been edged with whitewashed rocks. It was the one weak spot in the fortress, and all the men knew it.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The 24th had spent the last hours making their barracks as impregnable as possible, gouging dozens of loopholes in the side facing the east and barricading the wide windows that had once been so coveted but which were now the building’s biggest weakness. There was nothing else they could do. They all knew the barracks would be the scene of the heaviest fighting when the Maharajah’s army arrived to attack the survivors of Proudfoot’s forces.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Wanted to keep his special chum safe, I expect.’ Dutton’s voice was slurred, and he took another large mouthful of the brandy. ‘Good riddance, if you ask me.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack reached out for the bottle, wiping the neck on the sleeve of his red coat before taking a more circumspect sip. He was surprised at Proudfoot’s decision to send Fenris away. ‘Where will he go?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Fort St John. There is a column based there. Mainly cavalry, too.’ Dutton looked longingly at the brandy as Jack drained a fair quantity of the precious liquid. ‘Because of me, we need help.’ His head hung in shame as he admitted his error.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You wanted to fight. That’s what it’s like.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton looked up at Jack’s harsh words, pain etched into the lines on his face. ‘I was a fool. I wish I had died with my men.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack scowled. ‘Then you truly are a fool. You are alive. Be thankful for that.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton snatched the brandy back, lifting the bottle to his lips but keeping his eyes on Jack as he drank, careless of the fiery liquid that spilled from his mouth to run into his beard. When he finally lowered the bottle, he turned to stare outwards again, the light of the burning cantonment reflecting in his moist eyes.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I killed them, Jack. I killed my own men.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘No. Those bastard horsemen killed them.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton shook his head slowly. ‘I fired too late. If I had given the order earlier, we would have stopped them. As you did.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You did your best.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘And I failed.’ Dutton’s head hung so that his chin rested on his chest, as if his neck was no longer capable of supporting its weight.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘I know.’ Jack waited for Dutton to look at him. It took a while, but eventually the major raised his head. ‘It was your first battle.’ Jack spoke softly. ‘It’s not some bloody parade. It’s vicious and it’s violent.’ He held Dutton’s stare as he spoke, delivering his biting judgement with bitter honesty. ‘Either you live or you die, and there is bugger all you can do about which of those it is. You and your men fought hard and you brought as many of them here as you could. That’s all that matters.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton looked at Jack for some time, as if trying to come to terms with what the younger man had said. Eventually his face softened, whether from finding some peace of mind or simply from the large amount of brandy he had consumed Jack could not tell.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘So what happens tomorrow?’ Dutton asked, his voice calm once again.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘They attack. Those horsemen today were his irregular cavalry. The main body of his army has only just arrived. I expect we will have to face his infantry first, and believe me, there are a lot of those bastards. They’ll hit us on all sides, and if we break, he’ll send in his bloody lancers.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton listened to Jack’s prediction before sucking in a deep breath. ‘So tomorrow we die.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack snorted at the melodramatic phrase. ‘No. Tomorrow we fight.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He turned as he heard the soft tread of footsteps behind them, wary of anyone coming to interrupt his conversation.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Good evening, General.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Isabel.’ Jack could not hide the pleasure in his voice. ‘Does your father know you’re here?’ He smiled as he helped her on to the fire step behind the barricade, offering her his hand so that she could sit beside him.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Father is drunk.’ The corners of Isabel’s mouth twitched in disapproval.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Sensible fellow.’ Dutton took another slug of brandy, already too drunk himself to be concerned about his behaviour in front of a lady.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Perhaps. May I?’ Isabel held out her hand questioningly towards the brandy, which Dutton passed over, as if sharing hard spirits with young women was an everyday occurrence.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">She took a demure sip, grimacing at the harsh taste. ‘Your wife is asking after you, Major Dutton. She seems most concerned.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Dutton shook his head ruefully. ‘Poor Hilary. She is not cut out for any of this.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack felt Isabel’s body pressing against his side as she sat beside him. She smelt wonderful, the delicate fragrance of her fresh perfume a balm to his soul, its subtle aroma driving away the smell of burning and of death.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘She is made of sterner stuff than you give her credit for,’ she replied evenly, brushing at her dress. ‘She is with the wounded. Doing what she can to help.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘She is a fine woman. She deserves better.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘None of us chooses our fate.’ Isabel looked at Jack as she offered her advice to Dutton. ‘It chooses us. All we decide is how we face it.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">The three sat in silence as they contemplated Isabel’s words. The cantonment was well ablaze, the heat of the flames warm on their faces as the chill of the night set in. Shadowy figures flitted into view amidst the burning buildings, but none ventured close to the temporary refuge the British had erected. It seemed the survivors were to be left in peace for the night.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel slipped her hand forward so that it rested on Jack’s thigh. ‘Perhaps we didn’t do the right thing after all.’ She broke the silence with a whisper, her mouth close enough to Jack’s ear that he could feel the warmth of her breath on the side of his face. Her fingers were like red-hot coals on his leg and he wished they were alone.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘And miss all this. How can you even think that?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Isabel rapped his leg. ‘So what happens now?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘We fight.’ An unexpected voice answered her question.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">None of the three had heard the footsteps of Major Proudfoot as he approached. ‘We hold here until the flying column from Fort St John arrives. Isn’t that right, Lark?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot bounded on to the fire step, the jet-black cloak draped over his shoulders billowing around him as he leapt athletically over the wall of mealie bags, landing on the balls of his feet before turning to face his meagre audience.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack looked at the odd creature that had capered across the wall like a demented goat. ‘I reckon that’s right.’ His voice was guarded.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Major Dutton.’ Proudfoot lifted a quizzical eyebrow in his subordinate’s direction. ‘Can we hold?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Maybe, maybe not.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot nodded his head as if Dutton had offered wise advice rather than such a bitter statement. He spun on his heel and studied the burning cantonment for some time.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Do <span class="bt1-body-text-1-italic">you</span> think we can hold?’ Isabel asked the question to the back of Proudfoot’s head when she could stand the silence no longer.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Of course,’ the major answered without turning round. ‘But perhaps you should ask the commander of the 24th?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘He’s not here.’ Jack answered the odd question. ‘Kingsley appears to have disappeared.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Captain Kingsley is indisposed.’ Proudfoot steadfastly refused to turn around and remained facing the fires. ‘He is with the sick. He will stay there until after the battle. He took a nasty blow to the head and it has quite addled his wits.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Then ask your lapdog when he gets back.’ Jack’s opinion of the lieutenant was clear in his derisory tone.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot wheeled round suddenly and Jack felt Isabel start at the dramatic posturing. ‘Fenris does not command the 24th.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Then who will?’ Jack’s tone was belligerent. He had endured enough of the major’s games.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘You. You will command them.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Me!’ Jack was genuinely astonished.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘As of this moment I am promoting you. You are to be Captain Lark. The 24th are yours.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack blinked hard. ‘I thought I was to hang?’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Proudfoot smiled. For the first time Jack saw some warmth make its way into the major’s eyes. ‘That was before. This is now. I want you to command the 24th. You are the best man for the job. You proved that today.’</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack laughed. He threw back his head and guffawed, careless of the men who turned to stare at the madman hooting so loudly.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Do you accept?’ Proudfoot chuckled, joining in Jack’s mirth.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Oh yes. I accept.’ Jack slipped from the wall and walked to stand in front of the major.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">‘Then you will be wanting this.’ Proudfoot pulled open his cloak. For the first time Jack saw that he was wearing a sword.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">His sword.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He watched, his heart hammering in his mouth, as Proudfoot undid the buckles that held the scabbard around his waist. It was only when the major handed him the fabulous weapon that he realised how much he had missed it since it had been taken from him when he had first been arrested. He had never owned anything of such extraordinary value, yet it was not the wealth it gave him that he had missed.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He had been awarded the sword for his bravery. He had not bought it. He had not taken it. He had earned it.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">Jack took a step backwards and carefully, reverentially, buckled the slings of the scabbard to the belt around his waist.</p>
				<p class="ack-acknowledgement-text">He was a captain. This time he hadn’t stolen the rank. It had been granted freely. He was an officer. It might only be temporary and out of convenience, but it did not matter. He had been a maharajah’s general, then a British redcoat. Now, for the first time, he was Captain Jack Lark. Perhaps it would only be for a matter of hours, but Jack did not care. He would lead the 24th into battle, and he vowed he would not let them down.</p>
